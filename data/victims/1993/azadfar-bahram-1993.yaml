    Mr. Bahram Azadfar was patient, reserved, kind, and personable, and he
    loved volleyball. News and information of the extrajudicial killing of Mr.
    Bahram Azadfar, also known as Bahram Ajam, was gathered from Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center s interview with Mr. Azadfar s friend (August 10, 2021).
    Additional information on this case was collected from an Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center interview with one of Mr. Azadfar s fellow party members
    (October 12, 2021), Website for Martyrs Connected to the Kurdish
    Democratic Party (no date), and an article published by Brigham Young
    University in the United States* (2013). Mr. Azadfar was 40 years old. He
    was single, Azari, and he was from Orumieh in West Azerbaijan Province. He
    had a high school diploma (Abdorrahman Borouman interview, August 10,
    2021). Mr. Azadfar served in the army, both before and after the
    revolution. In the fall of 1983 he became a member of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party of Iran. A short while later he became responsible for
    "the task force"** of this Party, and he sustained injuries in several
    operations of this force. He also served as an educator at the
    headquarters of this Party. He taught literacy classes for the illiterate
    Peshmerga. He also taught classes on politics and military science for the
    Peshmerga and for Party staff (October 12, 2021). Mr. Azadfar was an
    influential person. As a non-Kurdish Peshmerga in the Kurdish Democratic
    Party of Iran, he was successful in encouraging young people to join the
    Party and to struggle against the central government. Since he spoke
    Turkish, he was engaged in Kurdistan Democratic Party political and
    organizational activities and operations in the border regions between
    Iraq, Iran, and Turkey (Boroumand Center Interview, August 10, 2021). Mr.
    Azadfar set up the Azerbaijan Branch of the Democratic Party in 1985. In
    this endeavor, he was accompanied by several Turkish speaking Peshmerga
    from the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran. They were aided and supported
    by the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran. Their goal was to carry out
    political activities in Turkish speaking areas of Iran. However, their
    activities were not very successful, and this group was disbanded less
    than a year later. At this time, he rejoined the Kurdish Democratic Party
    of Iran (Boroumand Center Interview, October 12, 2021). Mr. Azadfar went
    to Turkey as a political refugee in the winter of 1992. He intended to
    appeal to the Turkish government for help with the regrouping of the
    Azerbaijan Branch of the Democratic Party, so that they could carry out
    serious political activities in opposition to the government of Iran and
    in aid of the Turkish Peoples movement for ethnic rights (Boroumand Center
    Interview, October 12, 2021). Mr. Azadfar wrote a letter to his fellow
    Party member in the spring of 1997 and described his political activities
    in Turkey. He wrote, Things are moving along very well. I have been able
    to set up a series of meetings with Turkish officials. Everything is going
    well. I might be able to return soon and visit my friends in the
    Democratic Party. (Boroumand Center Interview October 2021) According to
    another friend, he was sociable, kind, popular, and affable. He liked to
    work with people and to help them. (Boroumand Center Interview, August 10,
    2021) One of Mr. Azadfar s fellow Party members said he was democratic,
    freedom loving, virtuous, patient, and reserved. He had leftist political
    ideas. Mr. Azadfar liked to read, listen to the radio, drink tea, smoke
    cigarettes, and play volleyball. He was very capable and knowledgeable in
    military matters. (Boroumand Center Interview, October 12, 2021) The
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan The Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with the goal to gain autonomy for
    Kurdistan, in north-western Iran. After the Revolution, conflicts between
    the new central Shiite government and mainly Sunni Kurdistan regarding the
    role of minorities in the drafting of the constitution, specification of
    Shiite as the official state religion, and particularly the autonomy of
    the region, ended in armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and
    the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum
    of April 1, 1979, when people went to polls to vote for or against the
    Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the
    party of Satan and declared it unofficial and illegal. Mass executions and
    fighting broke out and continued for several months in the region. By
    1983, the PDKI had lost much of its influence in the region. In the years
    since various leaders of the PDKI have been assassinated. Following
    internal disputes, the party split in 2006 and two organizations were
    established as The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, and The
    Democratic Party of Kurdistan. Mr. Bahram Azadfar s Death In the morning
    of August 28, 1997 (Article, 2013), Mr. Bahram Azadfar was killed with a
    gun in the Altindag area of Ankara, Turkey. (Borou
