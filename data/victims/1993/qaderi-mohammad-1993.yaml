    He was a sharp, straightforward, decisive, fearless, and social commander
    within the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), who was
    tragically assassinated in Turkey. Information regarding the extrajudicial
    execution of Mr. Mohammad Qaderi, son of Ameneh and Mohammad Amin, was
    obtained through separate interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center. These interviews were conducted with three individuals:
    a close relative of Mr. Qaderi (November 18 and December 19, 2021), a
    friend and fellow party comrade (November 15, 2021), and his roommate at
    the time of his death (December 7, 2021). Additional information was
    gathered from the book *Who Killed Uğur Mumcu* (by Adnan G ler, 2011), an
    Amnesty International report (April/May 1993), the Shahid website
    affiliated with the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, and the
    archives of Brigham Young University* in the U.S. (2013). Mohammad Qaderi
    was born in 1962 in the Kurdish village of Sarukani, part of the
    Piranshahr district of West Azerbaijan province. He had three brothers,
    one of whom became a Peshmerga member of the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan and was killed during the Kurdish struggle. Mohammad Qaderi's
    education reached only the third year of middle school (ABC interview,
    November 15, 2021). After the 1979 revolution, Mr. Qaderi became a member
    of the Komala Party for less than a year. He then joined the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) as a Peshmerga and served as a commander
    for PDKI forces in the regions of Dimdim, Naqadeh, Arbabah, Baneh, and
    Afshin. After the split within the PDKI in 1988, he joined the newly
    formed faction known as the "Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan -
    Revolutionary Leadership" in early April 1988. (ABC Interview, December
    19, 2021) According to one of his party comrades, the Iranian government
    was well aware of Mr. Qaderi's involvement in various military operations
    in Kurdistan and sought to eliminate him. Iranian military and security
    forces repeatedly entered his father's home at night to pressure Mr.
    Qaderi, destroying household property and physically assaulting and
    insulting family members. The source also mentioned that the Piranshahr
    Intelligence Office detained one of Mr. Qaderi's brothers, Bayazid Qaderi,
    once in 1984 and again in June 1986 in an attempt to force Mohammad Qaderi
    to surrender. Two days after his arrest, the Piranshahr Intelligence
    Office returned Bayazid Qaderi's dead body to his family, with signs of
    having been shot six times in the head and hands. (ABC Interview with a
    friend and party comrade, November 15, 2021) In 1990, Mr. Qaderi left the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan - Revolutionary Leadership to avoid
    internal party conflicts and to work and financially support his family.
    He moved to Soran in Iraqi Kurdistan, where he opened a teahouse in the
    Ali Beg Valley, a recreational area near Rawanduz. In the spring of 1993,
    due to repeated threats from individuals affiliated with the Iranian
    government, he sought political asylum in Turkey and moved to the city of
    Kırşehir. (ABC Interview with a friend and party comrade, November 15,
    2021) Two such threats occurred in 1991. In the first instance, while
    still a member of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, he was
    arrested by forces from a party influenced by the Iranian government who
    intended to hand him over to the Iranian authorities. He was released with
    the help of his friends and the mediation of local leaders (ABC interview
    with a party comrade, November 15, 2021). A few months later, during
    winter, someone confessed to him and his friend that the Revolutionary
    Guards in Piranshahr gave him "some money and a small caliber pistol" to
    assassinate Mohammad Qaderi. He revealed that he would receive additional
    money if he completed the assassination. According to Mohammad Qaderi's
    party comrade, the confession was made because the person knew he was
    incapable of doing the job. (ABC Interview with a fellow party comrade,
    November 15, 2021; ABC Interview with a relative, November 19, 2021)
    According to Mr. Qaderi's friend, he was "intelligent, straightforward,
    decisive, fearless, social, and honest. (ABC Interview with a friend and
    party comrade, November 15, 2021) Background on the Formation of the
    Kurdistan Democratic Party Following internal conflicts within the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan established in 1945 with the aim of
    autonomy for Kurdistan in northwestern Iran the Party went through a
    shakeup in 2006 and was split into two separate organizations, the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party
    (PDK). The PDK seeks the establishment of a Kurdistan Republic within the
    framework of a federal Iran . (Charter of the PDK, passed in its
    16thCongress in February 2016). This party has not ruled out armed
    struggle; it has, however, prioritized political struggle and the
    expression of the people of Kurdistan s demands through elections and
