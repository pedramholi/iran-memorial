    wife, Ferminia Moroni, was also an active member of the National Council
    of Resistance. and worked at the National Iranian Oil Company for a few
    years, and in 1971-72, worked for the Atomic Energy Organization. In 1980,
    Mr. Naqdi went to Italy on an [Iranian] government scholarship and
    continued his education at the Milan School of Management. He was hired by
    the Ministry of Foreign Affairs upon his return to Iran. Mr. Naqdi s
    family was among the officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran after the
    Revolution. In 1981, he was sent to Rome as the charg d'affaires of the
    Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Eight months later, however, in
    February-March 1982, he left the Embassy in protest of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran s oppressive practices, turned his diplomatic passport
    over to Italian authorities, and joined the National Council of
    Resistance, the Mojahedeen Khalq Organization s (MKO) political wing.
    According to available information, Mr. Naqdi remained in Italy as the
    Council s representative, and starting in 1984-85, he became the person in
    charge of the National Council of Resistance in Italy. He was known among
    the Italian politicians and members of the Italian Parliament, and gained
    the support of many among them for the National Council of Resistance.
    Among his last acts in the realm of diplomacy, was gaining the support of
    more than 300 Italian Members of the Parliament for the National Council
    of Resistance and the publication of their joint statement. The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of
    Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of politically
    motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the 1979
    Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the country
    have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of
    individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of
    the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however,
    these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since then, both
    inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far
    identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents
