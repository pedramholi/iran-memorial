    Mr. Darvishi was a learned cleric. He was a humanitarian, a lecturer, and
    a respected man. He was knowledgeable about politics. He was trusted, a
    good host, and a lover of freedom and democracy. Information regarding the
    extrajudicial killing of Mr. Molla Ahmad Darvishi, son of Bakr (Abu Bakr)
    and Zari, was collected from an interview with an acquaintance of Mr.
    Darvishi (November 18, 2021), and from a member of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party who was a friend of Mr. Darvishi (December 1, 2021). News
    of this killing was published in the RojiKurd Center Website (March 6,
    2017) and ASOO Website (February 1, 2019). Imam Khomeini Portal Website,
    Collected Works, Volume 6 (February 7, 1979 and February 26, 1979) was
    used for additional information. Mr. Molla Ahmad Darvishi was born in
    1933, into a poor farming family in the village of Margvar (Margavar),
    near Urumiyeh in Western Azerbaijan. He was married, and he had 8
    children. Mr. Darvishi was Sunni. He had religious training and was known
    as a religious mamoosta (teacher)*. He was a leader of Friday Prayers in
    several villages in Kurdistan Province and he also taught religious
    classes (Boroumand Center Interview, November 18, 2021). Mr. Darvishi
    joined the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran in the mid 1960s. He would
    talk to people about Party Politics in many Kurdish towns and villages.
    Locals would go to him to ask religious questions and to solve personal
    and collective problems (Center Interview, December 1, 2021). Contrary to
    Party policy, Mr. Darvishi did not believe in armed activities. He was of
    the opinion that peaceful solutions should be found to reconcile
    differences (Center Interview, November 18, 2021). According to Mr.
    Darvishi s acquaintance, after the February 1979 revolution, Mr. Darvishi
    and several other clerics from Kurdistan went to see Ayatollah Khomeini.
    According to this acquaintance, Mr. Darvishi was not happy with the
    meeting. He thought Khomeini was going to exacerbate religious conflicts,
    and that he was going to cause bloodshed in Iran using religion (Center
    Interview, November 18, 2021). There is no reliable information on the
    details of this meeting. The Imam Khomeini Portal Website alludes to two
    meetings between Khomeini and some people from Kurdistan in February 1979.
    In a meeting with a group of people from Kurdistan on February 7, 1979,
    Khomeini stressed the need for unity and fraternity between Shi a and
    Sunni (Collected Works of Khomeini, Volume 6, February 7, 1979). On
    February 26, 1979, in another meeting with clerics from Kurdistan present
    , Khomeini stressed national development and the need for setting aside
    differences (Collected Works of Khomeini, Volume 6, February 26, 1979).
    Mr. Darvishi did not believe Shi a and Sunni had conflicts. He believed
    both Sunni and Shi a worship God, and they both believe in Muhammad and in
    the Quran. There is no need for them to have conflict. He also believed in
    the rights of minorities, such as the right to speak their mother tongues
    and the right to perpetuate their culture and to practice their traditions
    (Center Interview, November 18, 2021). Around 1980, because of the bloody
    retributions against the Kurds in Kurdish areas, Mr. Darvishi left Iran.
    He settled in the village of Delizian, near the town of Diana (Soran), in
    Iraq. He was the leader of Prayer in a mosque in that area and he also
    continued to teach. After a while, some of Mr. Darvishi s family members,
    including his wife, joined him (Center Interview, November 18, 2021).
    According to Mr. Darvishi s acquaintance, Mr. Darvishi was summoned to the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Urumiyeh before he left Iran. The judge at
    this court told him, You have a role in the campaign of the Kurds against
    the Islamic Republic. That s why you {fear for your life}. According to
    this person, Mr. Darvishi replied to the judge, I am not fearful because
    of my campaigns and my activities. I am afraid of injustice. I am afraid
    of being unjustly slandered and arrested. (Center Interview, December 1,
    2021) According to people who knew him, Mr. Darvishi was a humanitarian, a
    lecturer, and a respected man. He was knowledgeable about politics. He was
    trusted, a good host, and a lover of freedom and democracy (Center
    Interview, November 18, 2021; Center Interview, December 1, 2021). The
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) The Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan was founded in 1945 with the goal to gain autonomy for
    Kurdistan, in north-western Iran. After the Revolution, conflicts between
    the new central Shiite government and mainly Sunni Kurdistan regarding the
    role of minorities in the drafting of the constitution, specification of
    Shiite as the official state religion, and particularly the autonomy of
    the region, ended in armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and
    the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum
    of April 1, 1979, when people went to polls to vote for or against the
    Islamic regime. On
