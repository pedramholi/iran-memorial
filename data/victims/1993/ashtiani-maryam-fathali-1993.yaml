    Ms. Ashtiani was 35 and she was a supporter of the Mojahedin e Khalq
    Organization. One of her brothers had been killed during the killings of
    summer 1988. Information about the forced disappearance and killing of Ms.
    Maryam Fath'ali Ashtiani has been published in the Women s Commission of
    the National Council of Resistance of Iran Website (November 25, 2021).
    Additional information was collected from Mojahedin e Khalq Organization
    Website (December 26, 2016), Pioneers of Iran s Freedom Path Weblog Tehran
    Province (February 4, 2016), and Radio Zamaneh Website (November 23,
    2021). Ms. Maryam Fath'ali Ashtiani was 35 years old. She was born in
    Tehran and she was a supporter of the Mojahedin e Khalq Organization
    (Pioneers of Iran s Freedom Path Weblog (February 4, 2016). She was
    arrested in 1990 and she was released from prison a while later. Ms.
    Ashtiani s brother, Mehdi Fath'ali Ashtiani , was a supporter of the
    Mojahedin e Khalq Organization. He was killed by firing squad during the
    killings of political prisoners in the summer of 1988 (1). Ms. Ashtiani s
    sister, Khadijeh Fath'ali Ashtiani, was a former political prisoner who
    had left Iran and who had joined Mojahedin e Khalq Organization members
    outside Iran (Women s Commission of the National Council of Resistance of
    Iran Website (November 25, 2021). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. (2) Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic
    of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of politically
    motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the 1979
    Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the country
    have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of
    individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of
    the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however,
    these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since then, both
    inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far
    identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases there has not been much published and
    the local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
    evidence, and traces obtained through investigations conducted by local
    police and judicial authorities confirm, however, the theory of state
    committed crimes. In certain cases, these investigations have resulted in
    the expulsion or arrest of Iranian diplomats. In limited cases outside
    Iran, the perpetrators of these murders have been arrested and put on
    trial and the evidence presented, revealed the defendants connection to
    Iran s government institutions, and an arrest warrant has been issued for
    Iran s Minister of Information. The manner in which these killings were
    organized and implemented in Iran and abroad, is indicative of a single
    pattern which, according to Roland Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor,
    contains common parameters and detailed planning. It can be ascertained
    from the similarities between these murders in different countries that
