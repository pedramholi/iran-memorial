    News of the execution of Mr. Ayub Jahangiri, along with three others, was
    published on the website of Peyke Iran on September 27, 2005, quoting the
    Organization for Defending Human Rights in Kurdistan. Additional
    information is taken from a letter written by Mr. Osman Mostafapur, Mr.
    Jahangiri s casemate, to Mr. Ahmad Shaheed, United Nations Special
    Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iran (The Campaign to Defend
    Political and Civil Prisoners, December 16, 2011), and the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation interview with a member of the Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan based on the archive of this party. Mr. Ayub Jahangiri,
    son of Teymur, a young Sunni Kurd, was from the Kurisofla Village in Anzal
    near Orumieh. He was a member of the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan. The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) was founded in
    1945 with the objective to gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in north western
    of Iran. After the Revolution, conflicts between the new central Shiite
    government and the mainly Sunni Kurdistan, regarding the role of
    minorities in the drafting of the constitution, specification of Shiite as
    the official state religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region,
    ended in armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and the Peshmerga
    (the militia of the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1,
    when people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime. On
    August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan and
    declared it unofficial and illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke out
    and continued for several months in the region. By 1983, PDKI had lost
    much of its influence in the region. Various leaders of the PDKI have been
    assassinated. Arrest and detention According to the interviewee, while
    performing their organizational duties, the Revolutionary Guards attacked
    Mr. Jahangiri and six other peshmarga of the PDKI in Orumieh District on
    July 14, 1991. (ABF interview) According to a member of this group, the
    Revolutionary Guards at the Asengran Targur area near Orumieh arrested Mr.
    Jahangiri and three others; two others were killed. (The letter by Osman
    Mostafapur to Ahmad Shaheed, Campaign to Defend Political and Civil
    Prisoners) The circumstances of Mr. Jahangiri s arrest and detention are
    unknown; according to his cellmate letter to Ahmad Shaeed, however, he was
    detained in solitary confinement by the Revolutionary Guards and the
    Intelligence Office in Orumieh for six months. On January 8, 1992, Mr.
    Jahangiri was transferred to the Orumieh Central Prison and met his
    friends for the first time. He told his friends that he had been tortured
    physically and mentally, and insulted by his interrogators for six months
    during which he had no visitation with his family or his attorney. (The
    letter by Osman Mostafapur to Ahmad Shaheed, Campaign to Defend Political
    and Civil Prisoners) Trial According to a defendant in this case, Mr.
    Jahangiri and others were tried on January 25, 1992. No information is
    available on his trial. (The letter by Osman Mostafapur) Charges According
    to the Organization for Defending the Human Rights in Kurdistan, the
    charge against Mr. Jahangiri had been cooperation with the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party of Iran . (Peyke Iran) The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Jahangiri. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Jahangiri s defense. According to a defendant in this
    case, the court did not allow defendants to select their attorneys and
    assigned them public defenders. (The letter by Osman Mostafapur) Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Ayub Jahangiri and two other defendants in this
    case to death. According to a defendant, Mr. Jahangiri was notified
    several months after the ruling was issued. He was executed at the Orumieh
    Central Prison in the summer of 1992. (The letter by Osman Mostafapur) Mr.
    Jahangiri s body was not given to his family and they were not informed of
    his burial location. (ABF interview)
