    Information regarding Mr. Hassan Sheibani’s case was drawn from two
    electronic forms, death certificate, court documents, letters and other
    documents sent to Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) by a person close
    to Mr. Sheibani. Mr. Sheibani was born to a feudal family on 2 January
    1938 in Mazhan, a village in Birjand, currently located in Northern
    Khorasan Province. His family had a history of political activism and a
    portion of their properties had been confiscated at the onset of the
    Islamic Revolution. Upon finishing his primary school education, he
    completed two years of legal training at the Military High School and
    received a law license. Mr. Sheibani was a warrant officer in the
    Gendarmerie (a military force charged with police duties.) In 1979, while
    travelling from Mashhad to Birjand, he was arrested in Gha’en (a small
    town in Khorasan province) based on a warrant issued by the Revolutionary
    Committee of Torbatheidarieh, served by the Qa’en Gendamerie, citing a car
    accident as the reason. He was subsequently held as an
    “anti-revolutionary” with two death row prisoners at the Melli Bank of
    Torbatheidarieh building. He was released in July 1979 after numerous
    correspondences with Mehdi Bazargan, the then Prime Minister. According to
    the individual close to Mr. Sheibani, the [real] reason for this arrest
    was [certain] officials’ personal enmity with him, stemming from an
    incident in 1976, during his tenure. There is no further information about
    this incident or the charges brought against Mr. Sheibani. In 1980 (after
    the Revolution), Mr. Sheibani was appointed Commander of the Anti-Narcotic
    Drugs within the Birjand regiment in southern Khorasan Province. In the
    same year or a year later, however, he was forced into compulsory
    retirement after 22 years of service, by the Purge Committee of the
    Military. In 1982, Mr. Sheibani was arrested once again by order of the
    Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office of Birjand. It is not clear what the
    reasons for this arrest were. According to the information sent to ABF,
    however, the charge brought against Mr. Sheibani was related to the
    commission of anti-revolutionary crimes. He was first taken to the
    Ministry of Intelligence Prison and then to Shahrbani Prison. He was
    released on bail after 9 months and given a one week leave, due to the
    death of his daughter. During his leave, he sent a letter to Ayatollah
    Khomeini detailing the illegal actions of the Birjand Prosecutor. The
    letter contained statement to the effect that “you can export the
    revolution to the Horn of Africa (meaning to the farthest and most
    unlikely places on the planet), but if there is no justice in Iran itself,
    you have failed.” After this letter and upon Ayatollah Khomein’s Decree
    known as the “Decree of Eight Articles”, the Birjand Prosecutor was
    dismissed and Mr. Sheibani did not return to prison. Mr. Sheibani was
    arrested once more in 1984 by order of the Revolutionary Prosecutor’s
    Office of Birjand for following up on his 1982 case, and was released on
    bail two months later. Since, at the time, the Iranian Bar Association was
    practically closed down and there were no attorneys in Birjand, Mr.
    Sheibani, who was well-versed in the law (because of his interest as well
    as his having studied the subject matter), worked as a lawyer in an
    unofficial capacity, after his retirement. He had tried to prevent his
    clients’ rights from being violated. , This turned him into a well-known
    and popular figure, as attested to by the large number of people attending
    his funeral in spite of a government ban to do so. Arrest and detention By
    order of the Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office of Birjand, Mr. Sheibani
    was arrested by [members of] the Intelligence Branch of the Revolutionary
    Guards, at 11 am on 24 December 1985 in Khosf, a village 35 kilometers
    from Birjand . In winter 1986-87 he escaped from prison and went to
    Mashhad, he and remained in hiding in Mashhad, Shiraz and Tehran. He was
    identified and arrested, along with his son, in May 1987 at Rahahan Circle
    in Tehran by the Intelligence Branch of Birjand Revolutionary Guards, and
    taken to Qasr Prison. Upon being interrogated, he was transferred to
    Birjand. In 1987, he was transferred from Birjand Shahrbani Prison to The
    Revolutionary Committee’s Prison in Birjand. In 1990, he was transferred
    to Vakilabad Prison in Mashhad where he spent one month prior to his
    execution. Mr. Sheibani escaped prison again in 1991 but he was rearrested
    three days later near the Iran-Afghanistan border. He was finally taken to
    Birjand to carry out the sentence. According to people close to him, Mr.
    Sheibani was in detention and under interrogation for 7 years, during
    which he was denied access to a lawyer with the exception of a very short
    period. However, Mr. Sheibani managed to write some notes on the back of
    his dirty laundry which he used to send out of prison to wash, in which he
    explained prison conditions and his trial. He spent most of his prison
    time in solitary
