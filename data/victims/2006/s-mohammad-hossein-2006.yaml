    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Hossein S., along with two other
    individuals, was announced by the website of ISNA citing the Public
    Relations Section of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Kerman
    Province (June 14, 2006) and the website of IRNA citing an authority in
    the Public Court of Kerman Province (June 15, 2006). The case of Mr.
    Mohammad Hossein S., and the other two, pertains to abduction, robbery and
    rape in the city of Kerman during February of 2006. Arrest and Detention
    There is no information available on the details of Mr. Mohammad Hossein
    S. s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Mohammad Hossein S. was tried by the
    Public Court of Kerman Province. However, there is no information
    available on the session or sessions of Mr. Mohammad Hossein S. s trial.
    Charges Mr. Mohammad Hossein S., along with two other individuals, was
    charged with multiple counts of abduction, robbery and rape. According to
    the report by the Public Relations Section of the provincial Ministry of
    Justice office of Kerman Province, Mr. Mohammad Hossein S. and the other
    two, disguising themselves as taxi drivers, would abduct female students,
    threaten them with a knife, steal their jewelry and sexually abuse them
    (IRNA). The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no
    information available on the details of the evidence entered against Mr.
    Mohammad Hossein S. Defense There is no information available on the
    details of Mr. Mohammad Hossein S. s defense. Judgment The Public Court of
    Kerman Province sentenced Mr. Mohammad Hossein S. to death. The verdict
    was approved by the Supreme Court. Mr. Mohammad Hossein S. was publicly
    hanged, along with two other individuals*, in Khaju Square of the city of
    Kerman on Tuesday June 13, 2006. ---------------------- *Alireza P. and
