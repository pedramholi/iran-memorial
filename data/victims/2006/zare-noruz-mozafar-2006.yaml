    News of the execution of Mr. Noruz (Mozafar) Zare was announced by the
    websites of ISNA (January 29, 2006) and Khabar-e Jonub (January 30, 2006),
    both citing the head of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Fars
    Province. Mr. Zare s case pertains to an armed robbery and murder in Fars
    Province in 2003. Arrest and Detention Mr. Zare was arrested by the police
    force of Gachsaran in 2003 and spent two years in prison (ISNA). However,
    there is no information available on the details of his arrest and
    detention. Trial Mr. Zare was tried by Branch Three of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Shiraz. However, there is no information available
    on the details of the session or sessions of his trial. Charges The head
    of the provincial Ministry of Justice Office of Fars Province stated the
    charges that were brought against Mr. Zare as: armed robbery as well as
    one count of abduction and murder of a Basij Force member (Khabar-e
    Jonoub, January 30, 2006). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    Twelve counts of armed robbery and one count of abduction were entered as
    evidence of guilt against Mr. Zare (Khabar-e Jonoub, January 30, 2006).
    Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr. Zare s
    defense. Judgment Branch Three of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Shiraz designated Mr. Noruz (Mozafar) Zare as Mohareb (someone who takes
    up arms against the holy state) and sentenced him to death. The verdict
    was approved by the Supreme Court. Mr. Zare was publicly hanged on a crane
    in the Tayun village of Shiraz on January 29, 2006.
