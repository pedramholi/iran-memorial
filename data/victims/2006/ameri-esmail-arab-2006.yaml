    Mr. Esmail Arab-Ameri claimed his wife was a sorceress who promised to
    resurrect his children if he murdered them. News of Mr. Esmail Arab-Ameri
    s execution along with two other individuals, was published by Javan
    newspaper and Iran newspaper websites (January 21, 2006). Additional
    information was obtained from Sharq newspaper (May 31, 2004), Iran
    newspaper (February 4 and 9, 2005), Ettela at newspaper (January 5, 2005),
    Hamshahri newspaper (January 5 and December 11, 2005), and Jam-e Jam
    (January 4, 2006). Mr. Esmail Arab-Ameri was married and had three
    children, was a motorcycle mechanic and resided in the city of Varamin s
    Pishva neighborhood. His case, along with the case of three other people,
    is related to the murder and rape of a woman and the murder of her brother
    in August 2003 in the mountains surrounding the village of Gacheh, as well
    as the murder of the his own two children on August 25, 2003, in the city
    of Varamin. This case gained notoriety as the year s most egregious. Based
    on available information, Mr. Arab-Ameri s spouse, Ms. Massumeh Shams
    Hessari, met one of the murder victims on the route she took to her son s
    medical treatment, and introduced herself to him as a student and a single
    woman. Her husband found out about the affair after a while and forced her
    to marry the man by obtaining a new identity card for her. Arrest and
    detention After these events, Mr. Arab-Ameri fled to Iraq, and upon return
    to Iran, he was arrested by police officers on February 5, 2004, in a
    motorcycle repair shop in the city of Kermanshah. Trial Tehran Province
    Criminal Court, Branch 71, tried Mr. Arab-Ameri. The first court session
    convened on January 2, 2005 under the authority of the presiding judge and
    four member judges, and in the presence of four defendants. His attorney
    was also present, but no further information is available regarding the
    trial session/s. Charges The Tehran Province Criminal Court presiding
    judge stated the charges against Mr. Arab-Ameri as being four counts of
    murder, and rape . The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Arab-Ameri was stated to be the defendant s confessions,
    several videotapes of the wedding and engagement ceremonies . Upon being
    arrested, during interrogations, he also confessed to the murder of a
    brother and sister. He denied all his confessions at the trial session,
    however, and stated that his spouse was the principal actor in the murders
    (Jam-e Jam). International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Denying his previous admissions
    in court, Mr. Arab-Ameri stated that his spouse had destroyed their lives
    and had robbed him of his faculty of thought by reciting incantations and
    putting a spell on him. He stated that she was a witch who had planned the
    murders and bore responsibility for them. He also stated that an Afghan
    man had committed the murder of his spouse s second husband. He further
    said that he had no knowledge of his spouse s second marriage, and said
    that he was simply working as a laborer at his spouse s wedding. Regarding
    the murder of his two children, he stated that it was upon the orders of
    his spouse, and that she had said if he sacrificed them, they would be
    resurrected. His attorney presented a defense but there is no information
    regarding the details. Judgment Tehran Province Criminal Curt, Branch 71
    sentenced Mr. Esmail Arab-Ameri to two death sentences for the murder of a
    brother and sister, to payment of two full Diahs ( blood money ) for the
    murder of his two children, and to death for rape. These sentences were
    upheld by Supreme Court Branch 33 and approved by the Head of the
    Judiciary Branch. He was hanged in the Evin Prison courtyard on Wednesday,
    August 19, 2005. His spouse was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for
    being an accomplice in the murder of her second husband, to 15 years
    imprisonment for being an accomplice in the murder of her two children,
    and to death for adultery. The other two defendants in the case were
    sentenced to 15 years imprisonment each, for being accomplices in murder.
    His spouse, Ms. Shams Hessari, was also executed on June 21, 2006.
