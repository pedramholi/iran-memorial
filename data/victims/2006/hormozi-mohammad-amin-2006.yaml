    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Amin Hormozi, son of Judak, was reported by
    Kayhan and Jumhuriye Islami Newspapers, on November 1, 2006. Additional
    information on this case was gathered from Boroumand Foundation research
    and an interview with Kayvan Rafi i, a human rights activist who had been
    this person s cellmate in Evin Prison (May 21, 2015), and also from Payk e
    Iran website (October 30, 2006) and Delavar e Baluch weblog (October 27,
    2007). Mr. Mohammad Amin Hormozi, a.k.a. Omran, has also been named Abdol
    Hamid Hormoz Zehi, Mohammad Amin Omar Zehi, Abdol Hamid Saravani, and
    Abdol Hamid Espandaki Saravani in different sources. He was 25 years old,
    married, and came from the village of Espandak, around Saravan, in the
    Province of Sistan o Baluchestan. He was a devout adherent of the Shafe i
    sect of Sunni Islam, he was a sportsman, and he was fit and trim. Mr.
    Hormozi did not have much formal education. He had been working as a day
    laborer, since his early youth. According to available information, when
    he was twenty years old, he became acquainted with Abdol Malek Rigi, and
    together with several friends, they all went to Faroughieh (Binoria)
    Salafi Seminary in Karachi, Pakistan, where he studied for two years.
    After that, he joined the Jondallah group and became its first military
    commander. Jondallah (Iranian People s Resistance Movement) is a
    paramilitary group that was established in southeastern Iran in July 2003.
    This group identified itself as the defender of the rights of the Baluchi
    Peoples, and ethnic minority in southeastern Iran. Their goals included
    protecting the culture of the Baluchi people, improving the socio-economic
    situation in Sistan o Baluchestan Province, and defending the religious
    rights of the Sunni minority in the Shi a dominated government of Iran.
    Since they used arms to achieve their goals, they became known as a
    terrorist group. This group later changed its name to Iranian People s
    Resistance Movement . Mr. Hormozi s case was related to armed resistance
    and kidnapping several tourists in southeastern Iran. Jondallah Group
    issued a statement in response to the execution of Mr. Hormozi and several
    other Baluchi citizens. In this statement they condemned these executions,
    and made known their intention to mount an armed response to avenge the
    executions. Arrest and detention Mr. Hormozi was arrested by security and
    police forces, three days after his wedding ceremony, in February 2004, in
    the village of Espandak, around Saravan. At the time of his arrest, there
    were more than a thousand members of the security and police forces
    involved in this operation. After his arrest, he was detained at the
    Zahedan Security Office for several months. During this time he was
    subjected to severe torture and interrogation. He was then taken to
    Section 209 of Evin Prison, in Tehran, where he spent two years. According
    to Kayvan Rafi i, a cellmate of Mr. Hormozi, he and two of his
    codefendants told terrifying stories of torture, assault and battery with
    lashings, during their time in the Zahedan Security Office. They said
    there was a sign over the door of the interrogation room: There is no God
    here . However, the living conditions of Mr. Hormozi and his codefendants
    in Evin Prison Section 209 were better than the other prisoners. They had
    access to clothes (other than standard Prison clothes), religious books,
    and Jondallah Group anthems, and they were allowed to observe religious
    rites. They offered their obligatory prayers together, memorized the Qur
    an, and fasted in periods other than Ramadan. They could meet with their
    families as a group, and their families could bring them particular items
    such as toothbrush sticks * and nas ** narcotics. At the same time, the
    prison officials and the interrogators had ideological conversations with
    Mr. Hormozi and other fanatical Sunni prisoners. They gave them some Shi a
    books, such as Shi a Answers to Questions . The officials had turned Mr.
    Mr. Hormozi and his codefendants cell into a center for torture. They
    would torture these prisoners and secular prisoners by putting them in the
    same cell for extended periods of time. In order to bother them, they
    would accuse the secular prisoners of doing things contrary to their
    religious beliefs, and would gossip about them. Mr. Kayvan Rafi i stated
    that Mr. Hormozi was hostile, because of his neurological and mental
    problems. Being in the same environment with secular prisoners provoked
    him and bothered him (Interview with Kayvan Rafi i and Boroumand
    Foundation Research, May 21, 2015). According to this witness, the prison
    interrogators repeatedly took advantage of Mr. Hormozi and other prisoners
    connected to Jondallah in contacting Abdol Malek Rigi and negotiating with
    him. Kayvan Rafi i, who had been Mr. Hormozi s cellmate for a brief
    period, was witness to one of these exchanges. He said he personally saw
    an interrogator bring a cell phone, take the prisoners out of the cell,
    give them the phone, tell th
