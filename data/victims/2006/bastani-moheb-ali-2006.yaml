    News of the execution of Mr. Moheb Ali Bastani was announced by the
    website of IRNA citing the Warden of Delijan Penitentiary on April 22,
    2006. Mr. Bastani was from Afghanistan and his case pertains to the murder
    of his wife. Arrest and detention There is no information available on the
    details of Mr. Bastani s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Bastani was tried
    by Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Delijan. However,
    there is no information available on the details of the session or
    sessions of Mr. Bastani s trial. Charges Mr. Bastani was charged with
    trafficking illegal drugs and mass distributing of narcotics. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    available on the details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr.
    Bastani. Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr.
    Bastani s defense. Judgment Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Delijan sentenced Mr. Moheb Ali Bastani to death. The verdict was
    validated by the Chief Public Prosecutor. Mr. Bastani was hanged in the
    courtyard of Delijan Prison on April 20, 2006.
