    News of the execution of Mr. Abdolvahed Nutizehi, son of Mousa, was
    announced by the website of Fars News Agency (May 18, 2006), citing the
    Public Relations section of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of
    Sistan and Baluchistan, as well as the website of ISNA of Sistan and
    Baluchistan (May 20, 2006). Mr. Nutizehi s case pertains to abduction and
    armed robbery. Arrest and Detention Mr. Nutizehi was arrested by agents of
    the police force. However, there is no information available on the
    details of his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Nutizehi was tried by a
    court in Sistan and Baluchistan Province. There is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of his trial. Charges
    Mr. Nutizehi was charged with abduction and armed robbery. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence entered against Mr. Nutizehi. Defense There is
    no information available on the details of Mr. Nutizehi s defense.
    Judgment A court in Sistan and Baluchistan Province sentenced Mr.
    Abdolvahed Nutizehi to death. The verdict was approved by the Supreme
    Court. Mr. Nutizehi was hanged in Zahedan County on May 17, 2006.
