    News of the execution of Mr. Gholam Hazrat A. along with two other
    individuals was announced by the website of the Police Information Center
    on December 19, 2006. He was an Afghan citizen and his case was related to
    rape and sedition. Arrest and detention Mr. Gholam Hazrat A. was arrested
    in the Rafsanjan County of Kerman Province. However, there is no
    information available on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial
    Mr. Gholam Hazrat A. was tried by the judiciary authority in Kerman
    Province. However, there is no information available on the details of the
    session or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Gholam Hazrat A. was charged
    with rape and sedition. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on the details of the evidence of guilt
    entered against Mr. Gholam Hazrat A. Defense There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Gholam Hazrat A. s defense. Judgment The
    judiciary authority in Kerman Province sentenced Mr. Gholam Hazrat A. to
    death. He was publicly hanged, along with two other individuals, in
    Rafsanjan County on December 18, 2006.
