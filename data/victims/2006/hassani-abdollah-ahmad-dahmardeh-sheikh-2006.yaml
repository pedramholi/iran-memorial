    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Dahmardeh was reported by Kayhan and
    Jomhuriy-e- Eslami Newspapers, under the name of Abdullah Shaykh Hasani ,
    on November 1, 2006. Additional information on this case has been gathered
    from research and an interview done by the Boroumand Foundation with
    Kayvan Rafi i, a human rights activist who had been held in Evin Prison
    with this person (May 21, 2015), and also from Payk- e-Iran website
    (October 30, 2006) and Delavar-e-Baluch weblog (October 27, 2007). Mr.
    Ahmad Dahmardeh, a.k.a. Mohajer, was between 25-33 years old. He was
    married, and was from Zahedan. He was a quiet person, religious, and an
    avid reader. Mr. Dahmardeh was a follower of the Shafe i sect of Sunni
    Islam, and he was fluent in Baluchi, Farsi, and Urdu languages. Mr.
    Dahmardeh went to school up to ninth grade. After that he went to
    seminary. Along with Abdul Malek Rigi and a few of his other friends, he
    went to Faroughieh (Binoria) Salafi Seminary School in Karachi, Pakistan.
    He studied in this seminary for two years. He established and joined
    Jondallah militant group. He was one of the theoreticians of this group.
    Jondallah (Iranian People s Resistance Movement) is a paramilitary group
    that was established in southeastern Iran in July 2003. This group
    identified itself as the defender of the rights of the Baluchi Peoples, an
    ethnic minority in southeastern Iran. Their goals included protecting the
    culture of the Baluchi people, improving the socioeconomic situation in
    Sistan o Baluchistan Province, and defending the religious rights of the
    Sunni minority in the Shi a dominated government of Iran. Since they used
    arms to achieve their goals, they became known as a terrorist group. This
    group later changed its name to Iranian People s Resistance Movement . Mr.
    Dahmardeh s case was related to armed resistance against the security
    forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran and kidnapping several tourists in
    southeastern Iran. Jondallah Group issued a statement in response to the
    execution of Mr. Dahmardeh and several other Baluchi citizens. In this
    statement they condemned these executions, made known their intention to
    mount an armed response to avenge the executions, and they established a
    military group in the name of Martyr Ahmad Dahmardeh . Arrest and
    detention Mr. Dahmardeh, along with two other people, was arrested in
    Tehran in February 2004. He was taken to Section 209 of Evin Prison in
    Tehran. According to Mr. Kayvan Rafi i, Mr. Dahmardeh s cellmate, he had
    been tortured during his interrogation (Interview with Kayvan Rafi i and
    Boroumand Foundation Research, May 21, 2015). The living conditions of Mr.
    Dahmardeh and his codefendants in Evin Prison Section 209 were better than
    for other political prisoners. Mr. Dahmardeh and his co-defendants had
    access to clothes (other than standard prison clothes), religious books,
    and Jondallah Group anthems, and they were allowed to observe religious
    rites. They offered their obligatory prayers together, memorized the Qur
    an, and fasted in periods other than Ramadan. They could meet with their
    families as a group, and their families could bring them particular items
    such as toothbrush sticks * and nas ** narcotics. At the same time, the
    prison officials and the interrogators had ideological conversations with
    Mr. Hormozi and other fanatical Sunni prisoners. They gave them some Shi a
    books, such as Shi a Answers to Questions . The officials had turned Mr.
    Dahmardeh and his codefendants cell into a center for torture. They would
    torture these prisoners and secular prisoners by putting them in the same
    cell for extended periods of time. In order to provoke them, they would
    accuse the secular prisoners of doing things contrary to their religious
    beliefs, and would gossip about them (Interview with Kayvan Rafi i and
    Boroumand Foundation Research, May 21, 2015). The prison interrogators
    took advantage of Mr. Dahmardeh and other prisoners connected to Jondallah
    in contacting Abdol Malek Rigi and negotiating with him. Kayvan Rafi i,
    who had been Mr. Dahmardeh s cellmate in 2005 and 2006, was witness to one
    of these exchanges. He said he personally saw an interrogator bring a cell
    phone, take the prisoners out of the cell, give them the phone, tell them
    Abdol Malek Rigi was calling, and asked them to talk to him (Interview
    with Kayvan Rafi i and Boroumand Foundation Research, May 21, 2015). Trial
    According to official reports, one of the branches of the Revolutionary
    Court of Sistan o Baluchestan Province tried Mr. Dahmardeh. In these
    reports, his name is given as Abdullah Shaykh Hosseini (Kayhan Newspaper,
    November 1, 2006). However, according to Mr. Rafi i, who was his cellmate,
    Mr. Dahmardeh and two other defendants were tried in the Revolutionary
    Court of Tehran. The prison officials transported them to court in three
    cars, with their eyes blindfolded. After being held outside the Judge s
    office for awhile, they were called in. The trial took about a minute. The
    judge asked the
