    News of the execution of Mr. Ali H., along with another individual, was
    announced by E temad-e Melli Daily citing the Public Relations Section of
    the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Khuzestan Province (November
    4, 2006) and the website of Fars News Agency (November 3, 2006). The case
    of Mr. Ali A. pertains to a premeditated murder. Arrest and Detention
    There is no information available on the details of Mr. Ali H. s arrest
    and detention. Trial Mr. Ali H. was tried by Branch Six of the Public
    Court. However, there is no information available on the session or
    sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Ali H. was charged with premediated
    murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no
    information available on the evidence of guilt entered against Mr. Ali H.
    Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr. Ali H. s
    defense. Judgment Branch Six of the Public Court of Ahvaz sentenced Mr.
    Ali H. to death. The verdict was approved by Branch 27 of the Supreme
    Court. Mr. Ali H. was hanged, along with another individual*, in the
    courtyard of the Karoun Prison of Ahvaz on November 2, 2006.
