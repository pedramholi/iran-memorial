    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Baqeri, son of Mohammad, along with two
    other individuals, was announced by the website of Fars News Agency
    (December 24, 2006), Kayhan daily (December 25, 2006), and the website of
    Iscanews (January 10, 2007), all citing the Public Relations section of
    the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Sistan and Baluchistan. Mr.
    Baqeri s case is related to storing and carrying of illegal drugs. Arrest
    and Detention There is no information available on the details of Mr.
    Baqeri s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Baqeri was tried by Branch One of
    the Revolutionary Court of Zahedan. There is no information available on
    the details of the session or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Baqeri
    was charged with storing, carrying and trafficking of illegal drugs (Fars
    News Agency and Kayhan daily). The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt Possessing 16 kilograms and 300 grams of heroin was entered against
    Mr. Baqeri as evidence of guilt (Fars News Agency). Defense There is no
    information available on the details of Mr. Baqeri s defense. Judgment
    Branch One of the Revolutionary Court of Zahedan sentenced Mr. Ali Baqeri
    to death. The verdict was approved by the Supreme Court. Mr. Baqeri was
    hanged publicly,along with two other individuals, at the Karegar Square of
    Zahedan on Sunday, December 24, 2006.
