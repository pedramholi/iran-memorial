    News of the execution of Mr. Gholamreza A. along with two other
    individuals was announced by Javan daily (November 19, 2006) and Khabar-e
    Jonoub daily (November 20, 2006). Mr. Gholamreza A. was from Gonbad-e
    Kavus and his case pertains to storing and carrying illegal drugs. Arrest
    and detention There is no information available on the details of Mr.
    Gholamreza A. s arrest and detention. Trial There is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of Mr. Gholamreza A. s
    trial. Charges Mr. Gholamreza A. was charged with storing and carrying
    narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    Possessing 5.41 kilograms of heroin was entered as evidence of guilt
    against Mr. Gholamreza A. (Khabar-e Jonoub). However, Javan daily reported
    the amount of heroin as 14.5 kilograms. Defense There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Gholamreza A. s defense. Judgment Mr.
    Gholamreza A. was sentenced to death. He was hanged, along with two other
    individuals, in Shahrud Police Central Command on Thursday, November 16,
    2006.
