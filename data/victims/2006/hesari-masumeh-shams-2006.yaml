    News of the execution of Ms. Ma sumeh Shams Hesari was published on the
    website of Khabaronline on June 22, 2006. Additional information was taken
    from websites of the Mehr news agency on October 21, 2012, Fars news
    agency and ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on June 20, 2006, the
    Hamshahri newspaper on January 5 and December 11, 2005, the Iran newspaper
    on January 5 and February 9, 2005, the Ettela at newspaper on January 5,
    2005, Jamejam on January 3, 2005, and the Sharq newspaper on June 1, 2004.
    Ms. Shams Hesari was married with three children, a housewife, and a
    resident of Pishva near Varamin. Her case, along with three others,
    including her husband, an Afghan man, and a man from Firuzkuh, was related
    to the murder of a brother and a sister and two small children in Varamin
    in September of 2004. This case was the most notorious criminal case of
    the year. According to the existing information, Ms. Shams Hesari came to
    know one of the victims while commuting for her son s medical treatment.
    She introduced herself as single and a student. Her husband found out
    about this relationship, got a new birth certificate for her, and married
    her to the victim. He introduced himself as Ma sumeh s uncle and, in
    another plot, arranged the marriage of the victim s sister with another
    man. He then murdered both brother and sister when opportunity permitted.
    In addition, he murdered his own two children, 6 and 11, who had been
    witnessed the murder, in the bathroom of his house. Arrest and detention
    Ms. Shams Hesari was arrested after her husband, Mr. Esma il Arab Ameri,
    had been arrested and confessed on September 24, 2004 (ISNA). The
    circumstances of her arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 71
    of the Criminal Court of Tehran, presiding with one judge and four
    counselors, tried Ms. Shams Hesari and three other defendants in an open
    session on January 2, 2005. (Jamejam) Charges According to the Head of the
    Criminal Court of Tehran, the charges brought against Ms. Shams Hesari
    were adultery while married and participation in murdering a brother and
    sister and her own two young children. (Iran newspaper on January 5, 2005)
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Ms.
    Shams Hesari was the confession of her husband, the first row defendant.
    However, her husband rejected all his confessions during the trial and
    claimed that his wife, as a witch, was the plotter and responsible for all
    murders. (Jamejam) International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees, and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense During the trial, Ms. Shams
    Hesari stated that she was not present at the Varamin crime scene when her
    new sister-in-law was murdered and she was at their house. In her defense,
    she accepted all charges but emphasized that her husband, Esma il, lied.
    She married one of the victims on his order. However, she knew about her
    husband s revenge from her new sister-in-law. Regarding the murder of her
    two children, she claimed that she was at her mother s house at the time
    and was not aware of their murder. She introduced her ex-husband as the
    plotter and executioner of all murders. Judgment Branch 71 of the Criminal
    Court of Tehran condemned Ms. Ma sumeh Shams Hesari to 45 years
    imprisonment for assistance in four murders, and to death for adultery
    while married. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. She was hanged in
    the Evin Prison in Tehran on June 21, 2006. Her husband, the first row
    defendant, was condemned to death, two counts, for murdering a brother and
    a sister, to paying two Dieh (blood money) for murdering his two children,
    and to death for adultery. He was executed on January 18, 2006. The third
    and fourth row defendants were also condemned to 15 years imprisonment
    each for assistance in a murder.
