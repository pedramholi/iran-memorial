    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammadali Afsaneh, son of Haj Abbas, was
    announced by Iran daily (December 13, 2006) and the website of Khabar-e
    Jonoub (December 5, 2006). Additional information on this case was
    obtained from Islamic Republic daily (March 1, 2005), the websites of
    Khabar-e Jonoub (June 13, 2006) and the Iranian Students News Agency ISNA
    (July 2, 2006); and Kayhan daily (December 12, 2006), citing the Public
    and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Jahrom County. Mr. Afsaneh, from Jahrom,
    was married and had three children. His case and that of three other
    individuals pertains to the murder of 12 people in his brother s orchard
    in Jahrom County on February 24, 2006. A few years before that incident,
    Mr. Afsaneh had killed an Afghan who had broken his ass s leg, for which
    Mr. Afsaneh had spent some time in prison. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Afsaneh was arrested by agents of the central command of the judiciary
    police of Fars Province in the Mahkuyeh Cavern of Firouzabad County of
    Fars Province, on April 14, 2006. His sons, who had accompanied him on the
    day of the incident, turned themselves in to the authorities of the
    provincial Ministry of Justice office on the same day, and the fourth
    defendant was arrested on February 25, 2006. Mr. Afsaneh fled the scene
    after the incident, and for 52 days lived in a cavern under the protection
    of his friends. He spent eight months in prison after arrest, and his last
    meeting with his family occurred on December 12, 2006. Trial Branch Five
    of the Public Court of Fars Province tried Mr. Afsaneh, and three other
    defendants, on June 12, 2006 in the presence of the judge, the judiciary
    deputy of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Fars Province, and
    the government-appointed defense lawyer for the defendants. The court
    proceedings were open to the public. Charges Mr. Afsaneh was charged with
    12 counts of murder with heavy firearms. According to the available
    information, after having a dispute with his brothers over financial
    issues, Mr. Afsaneh, on the day of the incident, along with his sons and
    one of his manual workers, opened fire on and killed 6 women and 5 men, in
    addition injuring 4. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt Confessions of the
    defendants, complaints of the families, testimonies of the eyewitnesses,
    discovery of firearms, report of the firearm experts and statement of the
    forensic office were entered as evidence of guilt against Mr. Afsaneh.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense During the court proceedings, Mr. Afsaneh defended
    himself by stating that he had been taking pills for his mental disorder
    for the past 25 years, and that during the day of the incident he had not
    been of sound mind, because he had taken 30 pills as well as 3 cubes of
    opium. He added that prior to what happened, he had done everything to
    solve his financial problem. The creditors had overwhelmed him. His
    brothers would not give him his share of the common property, either. Mr.
    Afsaneh said in his defense, I am crazy. I did this thing, but I brought
    the firearm from Estahban with the help of my elder brother. I wanted to
    sell my share of the orchard, but my other brother would not let me. My
    elder brother is the cause of all my misery. I take pills; I take opium. I
    am a wretched person. I know. I only remember the killing of my elder
    brother. I have no idea what happened next. It was not premeditated at
    all. Mr. Afsaneh s lawyer added, in his defense, that The fact that the
    defendant said in his statement that he had been in debt and that the
    others did not give him his due, these can t be taken as a strong
    motivation for murder. As such, I request that in view of the lack of
    proportionate motivation, as well as the statements of Alimohammad Afsaneh
    regarding his mental disorder, the honorable court convene a medical
    commission to conduct research in order to ascertain everything before the
    verdict is issued (Khabar-e Jonoub). In addition, during an interview Mr.
    Afsanehsaid said, My elder brother gave me the gun and provoked me to kill
    my other brothers to level my credit. He said he would satisfy the
    first-degree blood relatives of the victims if I did that. I was not in a
    natural state on the day the incident occurred. That day I was picking
    fruit. I was angry with my brothers and, all of a sudden, decided to do
    what he said. I was an uneducated individual, and nobody would listen to
    me (Khabar-e Jonoub). Judgment Branch Five of the Public Court of Fars
    Province sentenced Mr. Mohammadali Afsaneh to 10 times of execution on the
    charge of murdering 12 individuals. The verdict was valida
