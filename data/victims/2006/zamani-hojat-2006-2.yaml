    News of Mr. Hojat Zamani s execution was published in Iran newspaper,
    quoting the Judiciary Branch spokesperson, (February 22, 2006), by Amnesty
    International (February 17, 2006), on the Iran Press News website
    (February 15, 2006), in the Hojat Javidan weblog (March 7, 2006), and on
    the Aftab website (February 21, 2005). Additional information in this
    regard was obtained from the websites of Human Rights and Democracy
    Activists (February 6, 2008), Radio Free Europe (February 21, 2006), the
    Committee for the Follow Up of the Conditions of Rajaishahr Prison s
    Political Prisoners (February 22, 2006) Radio Farda (April 30, 2005),
    Ettela at newspaper (July 17, 2004), Amnesty International (February 3,
    2004), Hamshahri newspaper (June 3, and 6, 1998), International Ettela at
    newspaper (June 4, 1998), the Mojahedeen Khalq Organization of Iran
    website (May 1, 2017), and from Hojat Zamani s weblog. Mr. Zamani was born
    in a well-known family in Ilam County s village of Haft Cheshmeh, and
    finished his elementary and high school education there. After going
    through the Teacher Training College, he began working as a teacher in
    Ilam schools. Mr. Zamani was a very sensitive man and would become upset
    and start crying at hearing or seeing bad news. (Human Rights and
    Democracy Activists). According to available information, Mr. Zamani
    joined the Mojahedeen Khalq Organization of Iran (MKO) in 1997-98. His two
    brothers, Khaz al and Fallah were killed in skirmishes with the
    Revolutionary Guards in 1998 and 1999, when they were supporters of the
    MKO. Mr. Zamani s case is related to a bombing on June 2, 1998. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention Mr. Zamani was identified in Tehran s
    Vanak Square in July 2000, and arrested by the Revolutionary Guards
    forces. (Mojahedeen Khalq Organization of Iran). Mr. Zamani was
    incarcerated at Evin and Gohardasht (Rajaishahr) Prisons for four years
    and seven months. He was taken to Evin s Ward 209 for interrogations
    numerous times. (Iran Press News). According to available information, Mr.
    Zamani was subjected to physical and psychological torture during the
    interrogations, and went on several hunger strikes in 2004 and 2005, in
    protest of the prison conditions. (Mojahedeen Khalq Organization of Iran).
    Mr. Zamani was able to get out of prison and flee to Turkey 2003. He was
    arrested, however, on August 3, 2003, at Istanbul s Taqsim Square by the
    Turkish Security Police and turned over to Iranian authorities. (Amnesty
    International). Trial Tehran Islamic Revolution Court Branch Six tried Mr.
    Zamani in the summer of 2004. He had a court-appointed lawyer but no
    information is available regarding his trial session(s). Charges The
    charges brought against Mr. Zamani were declared to be supporting the
    Mojahedeen Khalq Organization of Iran and carrying out bombing . (Iran
    newspaper). According to available information, Mr. Zamani was accused of
    having participated in the bombing of the Tehran Islamic Revolution Court
    Building on June 2, 1998, which resulted in the death of four people and
    injury to 22 others. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence used against
    Mr. Zamani was declared to be the statements of plaintiffs and witnesses .
