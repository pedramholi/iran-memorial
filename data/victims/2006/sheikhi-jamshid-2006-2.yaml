    News of the execution of Mr. Jamshid Sheikhi, son of Ibrahim, along with
    another individual, was announced by the websites of E temad Melli
    (December 2, 2006) and Khabar-e Jonoub (December 4, 2006). Mr. Sheikhi s
    case, and those of three others, pertains to the hostage taking of a
    person and his death on January 3, 2000. Arrest and Detention Mr. Sheikhi
    was arrested after the family of the victim had filed a complaint against
    him to the police. He spent seven years in prison (Khabar-e Jonoub).
    However, there is no information available on the details of Mr. Sheikhi s
    arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Sheikhi and three others were tried by the
    public court. However, there is no information available on the details of
    the session or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Sheikhi was charged with
    premeditated murder and hostage taking. According to the available
    information, he and three others took a person hostage and asked his
    family for 200 million tomans in cash to release him. After three days,
    the hostage, due to his extremely ill health, was moved to hospital where
    he died one day later. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The
    complaint of the victim s family, the confessions of the accused, and the
    expert opinion of the coroner that the victim s death had resulted from
    the conditions of hostage taking were entered against Mr. Sheikhi as
    evidence of guilt. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Sheikhi s defense. Judgment The Public
    Court of Zahedan sentenced Mr. Jamshid Mr. Sheikhi to death. This verdict,
    after a couple of revisions by different authorities, was approved by the
    Supreme Court. Mr. Sheikhi was hanged publicly, along with another
    individual, at the juncture of Saeed and Amir al-Mo menin streets of the
    city of Zahedan on December 2, 2006. The other two defendants were each
    sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment.
