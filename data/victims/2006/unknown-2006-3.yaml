circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown individual along with two others was
    announced by the website Khorasan daily (February 6, 2006), citing the
    Public Relations section of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of
    Khorasan, and by Quds daily (February 12, 2006), citing the former head of
    the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Sabzevar County. The case of
    this unknown individual and the other two pertains to destroying the
    public peace and security. Arrest and Detention There is no information
    available on the details of this unknown individual s arrest and
    detention. Trial This unknown individual was tried by the Public Court of
    Khorasan. However, there is no information available on the details of the
    session or sessions of his/her trial. Charges This unknown individual and
    the other two defendants were charged with destroying the public peace and
    security. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no
    information available on the details of the evidence entered against this
    individual. Defense There is no information available on the details of
    this unknown individual s defense. Judgment The Public Court of Khorasan
    sentenced this unknown individual to death. The verdict was approved by
    the Supreme Court. This unknown individual was hanged in the city of
    Sabzevar in 2005.
