    News of the execution of Mr. Morteza M. was published on the websites of
    Iscanews on November 8, 2006 and Khabar Jonub on November 11, 2006. His
    case and the case of another defendant were related to the murder of an
    individual in Meybod, Yazd, in the fall of 2004. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Morteza M. was arrested, along with another person, by the Criminal Police
    in Yazd several days after a murder had happened in the fall of 2004. He
    was detained for two years. The circumstances of his arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial Branch Three of the Criminal Court of Yazd tried Mr.
    Morteza M. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Morteza M. was announced as murder. According to the
    Iscanews report, he had killed his friend with a knife in collaboration
    with another person. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Morteza M. However, the report referred to
    some unknown evidence. Defense No information is available on Mr. Morteza
    M. s defense. Judgment Branch Three of the Criminal Court of Yazd
    condemned Mr. Morteza M. to death. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling.
    He was hanged in Meybod on November 8, 2006 at 6 a.m. The other defendant
    in this case was condemned to 15 years imprisonment.
