    News of the execution of Mr. Changiz Naru'i, known as Jangouk, son of Haj
    Mohammad, along with two other individuals, was announced by the website
    of Fars News Agency (December 24, 2006), Kayhan daily (December 25, 2006),
    and the website of Iscanews (January 10, 2007), all citing the Public
    Relations section of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Sistan
    and Baluchistan. Mr. Naru'i s case pertains to murder, armed robbery,
    creating fear and trepidation, and looting the people s possessions.
    Arrest and Detention There is no information available on the details of
    Mr. Naru'i s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Naru'i was tried by Branch
    One of the Revolutionary Court of Zahedan. However, there is no
    information available on the details of the session or sessions of his
    trial. Charges Mr. Naru'i was charged with Moharebeh (taking up arms
    against the holy state), two counts of murder, armed abduction, creating
    fear and trepidation, destroying the public peace and security, armed
    road-blocking, selling illegal drugs, and using unauthorized arms and
    ammunition (Fars News Agency and Kayhan daily). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no information available on the
    details of the evidence entered against Mr. Naru'i. Defense There is no
    information available on the details of Mr. Naru'i s defense. Judgment
    Branch One of the Revolutionary Court of Zahedan, designating Mr. Changiz
    Naru'i as Mohareb and Mofsed-e Fel Arz (sower of corruption on earth),
    sentenced him to death. The verdict was approved by the Supreme Court. Mr.
    Naru'i was hanged publicly, along with two other individuals, at the
    Karegar Square of Zahedan on Sunday, December 24, 2006.
