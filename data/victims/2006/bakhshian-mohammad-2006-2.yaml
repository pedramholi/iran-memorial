    News of Mr. Mohammad Bakhshian s execution was published by Fars News
    Agency (June 21, 2006) and in Hamshahri newspaper (June 22, 2006).
    Additional information in this regard was obtained from Hamshahri
    newspaper (February 2, and 20, 2006, and June 20, 2006). He was from
    Lorestan [Province] and did plaster-work in buildings. His case and that
    of another individual is related to armed robbery of the Bank Melli Ebne
    Sina Branch and the murder of the branch manager in late December 2005, in
    the city of Esfahan. Arrest and detention Mr. Bakhshian and the other
    defendant in the case were arrested by Esfahan police officers at the
    scene of the crime. Mr. Bakhshian spent five months in prison. There is no
    information regarding the details of his arrest and detention. Trial
    Esfahan Criminal Court Branch One tried Mr. Bakhshian. The Esfahan
    Prosecutor, upon a special order of the Judiciary, asked the court to try
    the case in an extraordinary session. The Court was composed of a chief
    judge and four member judges. There is no information, however, about the
    trial session(s). Charges Mr. Bakhshian s charges were declared to be
    armed robbery and intentional murder . The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The defendants confessions were
    stated to be the evidence against Mr. Bakhshian. He said that on the day
    in question, they had entered the bank around 1:30 in the afternoon and
    intended to rob the it by threatening [the employees] with a weapon, when
    they were faced with the bank manager s resistance. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress . Defense
    Mr. Bakhshian had no prior criminal record and stated in his confession
    that he had engaged in criminal activity because of financial
    difficulties. He said that he only intended to threaten with the weapon
    but that he had faced the bank manager s resistance which had shocked him,
    and that he had fired out of fear. He said that he realized the mistake he
    had made [and was remorseful] and asked for forgiveness. He presented a
    defense in court but there is no information about the details of his
    defense. Judgment Esfahan Criminal Court Branch One found Mr. Bakhshian
    Mofsed fel-Arz ( one who spreads corruption on Earth ), and sentenced him
    to death on the charge of armed robbery, and further sentenced him to
    death for murder. The ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court on February
    19, 2006. On June 21, 2006, Mr. Bakhshian was hanged in public in Esfahan
    from a crane. The other defendant s trial was postponed until February 5,
    2007.
