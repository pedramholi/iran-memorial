    News of the execution of Mr. Moheb Ali Gholamian Moghadam was announced by
    the websites of IRNA (November 2, 2006) and Iscanews (November 3, 2006).
    His case pertains to the murder of a Baluchi man during a robbery. Arrest
    and Detention There is no information available on the details of Mr.
    Gholamian Moghadam s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Gholamian Moghadam
    was tried by Branch One of the Public Court of Zabol. However, there is no
    information available on the details of the session or sessions of his
    trial. Charges Mr. Gholamian Moghadam was charged with robbery and
    premeditated murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt There is no information available on the details of the evidence
    entered against Mr. Gholamian Moghadam. Defense There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Gholamian Moghadam s defense. Judgment
    Branch One of the Public Court of Zabol sentenced Mr. Moheb Ali Gholamian
    Moghadam to death. The verdict was approved by the Supreme Court. He was
    publicly hanged in the city of Doust Mohammad Bakhsh of Miyankangi of the
    Zabol County on Thursday, November 2, 2006.
