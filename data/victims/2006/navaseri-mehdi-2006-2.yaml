    Mr. Navaseri came from a poor family and had only finished middle school.
    Information about Mr. Mehdi Navaseri s execution was published in numerous
    media, including IRNA (March 2, 2006) and Sharq newspaper (March 2, 2006.)
    Mr. Navaseri was the first of the accused to be executed in connection
    with the 2005 Ahvaz bombings, along with Mr. Ali Afravi. In the following
    months, these executions continued, and dozens of other citizens were put
    to death. Additional information was obtained from an interview conducted
    by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation, with a person close to Mr.
    Navaseri and with another individual accused in the Ahvaz bombing cases,
    as well as from other news websites including, ISNA (March 1, 2006), Radio
    Farda (March 2, 2006), Ahwazi Democratic Popular Front (June 28, 2011),
    Amnesty International (March 1 and 2, 2006), Human Rights Watch (June 26,
    2006), and the Fars News Agency (March 1, 2006). Mr. Mehdi Navaseri was 20
    years old, single, and a resident of [the city of] Ahvaz (said the Ahwaz
    Human Rights Organization). According to a person close to him, in an
    interview conducted by the Boroumand Foundation, indicated that he came
    from a poor family and had only finished middle school. Amnesty
    International has stated his age as being 22. Mr. Navaseri s execution
    prompted the reaction of human rights institutions. Amnesty International
    protested by issuing bulletins, in which it considered the revolutionary
    court proceedings as unjust and based on confessions obtained under
    duress. The Ahwaz Human Rights Organization and the British Ahwazi
    Friendship Society also protested the execution of Arab citizens. Hours
    after the executions of Mr. Navaseri and Mr. Afravi, a bomb exploded on
    9thStreet in Ahvaz s Kianpars neighborhood, shattering windows and causing
    damage to surrounding buildings, although, according to local sources,
    there were no casualties. Historical Background of the Ahvaz Bombing
    Subsequent to the publication of a letter ascribed to a government
    official concerning systematic modification of the fabric of Khuzestan
    Province s ethnic Arab population, demonstrations broke out on Friday,
    April 15, 2005, in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in [the town of]
    Hamidideh. In quashing the demonstrations, security and police forces
    resorted to violence, which led to the death and injury of dozens of
    protestors and resulted in the protests and the unrest spreading to a
    number of other Khuzestan cities, continuing for at least 10 days.* These
    protests were the beginning of a series of incidents, including widespread
    arrests, multiple bombings, and successive executions in Ahvaz. For
    instance, a series of bombings followed on June 12 and October 15, 2005,
    and on January 24 and February 27, 2006, in various regions of Ahvaz,
    Abadan, and Dezful. These bombings were carried out in front of government
    buildings and in public places and left in their wake more than 20 dead
    and dozens injured.** According to government sources, other bombings
    (targeting oil pipelines and non-residential regions around Ahvaz)
    occurred at the end of summer and in the fall of 2005, which did not leave
    any casualties. In response to the Ahvaz bombings, security forces
    arrested dozens of the region s ethnic Arab individuals, charging them
    with participation in the bombings. They were then kept in solitary
    confinement cells, for months, at the Information Ministry s Detention
    Center. People being held were subjected to torture, in order to confess
    having taken part in the bombings. According to the Ahvaz Prosecutor,
    ultimately a total of four cases were opened at the Revolutionary Court,
    Special Branch, and at least 45 individuals were charged. Dozens of these
    individuals were tried in closed sessions and were sentenced to death by
    the Revolutionary Court. At least 19 of these sentences were carried out.
    Dozens of other Arab citizens were given long-term sentences. Government
    officials never accepted that these bombings had internal reasons which
    had arisen following the Khuzestan incidents. In multiple, and sometimes
    contradictory, statements, political and judicial authorities imputed
    responsibility to groups opposing [the Islamic Republic], including, Those
    loyal to the previous regime and residing in England; Fugitive SAVAK (the
    Shah s security and intelligence apparatus) members, and family members of
    the destroyed Monafeqin (MKO); Wahabis; secessionists; and/or to groups
    affiliated with the UK and other foreign countries. The Iranian government
    officially accused the UK of involvement in the bombings and declared that
    the bombers had been trained in Iraq, in regions under British army
    control, where they had acquired their arms and explosives. In one such
    statement, then-President Mahmud Ahmadinejad spoke of the clear and
    obvious footprint of Iraq s occupiers in the Khuzestan incidents. ( ISNA ,
    January 25, 2006). The British government officially denied these
    accusations and expressed its concern regarding such st
