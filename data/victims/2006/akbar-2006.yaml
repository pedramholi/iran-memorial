    News of the execution of Mr. Akbar (no last name), along with one other
    person, was reported in Fars News Agency website (September 20, 2006) and
    Etemad newspaper (September 21, 2006). Additional information about this
    case was collected from Ettela at newspaper (February 13, 2001 and July
    10, 2003). Mr. Akbar was married and had a two-month-old baby daughter.
    His case was related to an incidence of murder on Piruzi Street in Tehran,
    on August 10, 2000. Arrest and detention Following a murder incident, on
    August 10, 2000, Mr. Akbar tried to kill himself by setting his house on
    fire. The neighbors took him to a hospital and saved him from death. The
    date of his arrest is not clear, but it must have been between August 2000
    and February 2001. He spent six years in prison. The circumstances of Mr.
    Akbar s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 1602 of the
    Criminal Court of Tehran tried Mr. Akbar on January 31, 2001. Since the
    Supreme Court did not approve the verdict of the court, another session
    was held on July 9, 2003. No information is available on Mr. Akbar s
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Akbar was murder . According
    to available information, he was suspicious of his wife, killed her with a
    knife, and set the house on fire. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantee of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence against
    Mr. Akbar was confessions of the accused, discovery of his wife s body,
    and certification of his healthy state of mind. In his confession, he said
    he had suspicions about his wife, and during the night of the incident, he
    had killed her with a knife. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Akbar claimed he was
    mentally ill. The judges of the Supreme Court rejected the verdict of the
    first court and requested a medical commission to evaluate his mental
    health. He defended himself in court, but there is no information
    available on his defense. Judgment Branch 1602 of the Criminal Court of
    Tehran sentenced Mr. Akbar to death. Branch 40 of the Supreme Court
    approved this sentence after two reviews. He and another person were hung
    in Evin prison, on September 20, 2006.
