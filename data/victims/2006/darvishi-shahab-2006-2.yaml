    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt

    Second Branch of the Court of Appeals of Kermanshah Province. Among other
    charges brought against him was committing the despicable act of sodomy
    which resulted in the death sentence through hanging. The ruling was
    appealed, but Branch 27 of the Supreme Court confirmed the verdict and
    insisted on this punishment.” Mr. Shahb Darvishi was hanged in public at 3
    p.m. on November 14, 2006 at Azadi Square in Kermanshah.
