    Hamzeh Niazi was killed during the Naqadeh protests on May 25, 2006.
    Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Mr. Hamzeh Niazi was
    obtained from the Iranian National News Agency website (May 28, 2006) and
    the Faza el Azizaan blog (May 30, 2009). Additional information was
    gathered from the BBC Persian website (May 28, 2006), Radio Farda (May 31
    and June 22, 2006), and the Shahidler blog, quoting Oruzm (August 2007).
    Little is known about Mr. Niazi s life except that he participated in the
    Naqadeh demonstrations on May 25, 2006. Background of the 2006 Azerbaijan
    Protests On May 12, 2006, the state-run Iran newspaper published a cartoon
    in its Friday edition. In the cartoon, a cockroach responds to a child
    speaking to it in Azerbaijani with the question, "Nemanə?" (meaning
    "What?"). Many Azerbaijani readers interpreted the cartoon as equating the
    Azeri people with cockroaches, viewing it as an explicit insult to the
    Azerbaijani community in Iran. The authorities' longstanding refusal to
    allow education in mother tongues in schools had already created tensions
    among Azerbaijanis. News of the cartoon s publication, coupled with the
    lack of an official response to initial protests mainly organized in
    universities sparked a wave of street demonstrations beginning in late May
    2006. In Tabriz, Urmia, Ardabil, Zanjan, Marand, Maragheh, Ahar, Khalkhal,
    Khoy, Miyaneh, and Solduz (Naqadeh), protesters chanted slogans such as
    "Haray, haray, men Turkam" ("Cry out, cry out, I am a Turk"), demanding
    the suspension of Iran newspaper and a formal apology from high-ranking
    officials. As the protests escalated on May 23, 2006, the government
    officially condemned the cartoon as an "insult to Iranians." The judiciary
    ordered the suspension of Iran newspaper and the arrest of its editor and
    cartoonist. A motion to impeach the Minister of Culture and Islamic
    Guidance was raised in Parliament. Though these measures were intended to
    quell the unrest, they failed to calm public anger. On May 24, 2006, as
    demonstrations intensified in Tabriz, then-President Mahmud Ahmadinejad
    accused the United States of plotting to incite ethnic division. The
    judiciary and police in East Azerbaijan announced the arrest of more than
    50 individuals in connection with the protests. Iranian officials
    continued to attribute the protests to foreign interference and warned of
    harsh measures against demonstrators in Azerbaijan. The following day, in
    the city of Naqadeh (West Azerbaijan Province), police and Basij forces
    opened fire on protesters marching toward the governor s office. In
    response to this violent crackdown, thousands of demonstrators in Tabriz
    threw stones at government buildings and banks. Riot police across various
    cities used tear gas, batons, and, in some cases, live ammunition against
    the crowds. According to Azerbaijani activists and Amnesty International,
    at least 20 people were killed and dozens more were injured during the
    protests. However, Brigadier General Hassan Karami, the then-commander of
    the West Azerbaijan police, reported a lower toll of four dead and 43
    injured. On May 28, 2006, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described
    the demonstrators as agents of "the enemy" and declared: "The enemies do
    not know Azerbaijan; Azerbaijan belongs to the Islamic Revolution." Other
    officials echoed this sentiment in the days that followed. On May 29, the
    Minister of the Interior accused the United States of fueling the unrest.
    The government spokesperson blamed the protests on individuals and groups
    incited by satellite channels. The head of the East Azerbaijan Judiciary
    announced the arrest of 330 people in connection with the protests. It
    accused some of belonging to the "Baha'i faith, the "Tudeh Party," or
    having "links with Israel." In the following months, many detainees were
    prosecuted on charges such as "acting against national security,"
    "propaganda for separatism," and "ethnic incitement." Nearly two years
    later, in September 2008, the Urmia Military Prosecutor s Office ruled on
    the complaints brought by the families of the Naqadeh victims against
    police and Basij forces. It issued a non-prosecution order, declaring the
    use of firearms to have been in accordance with the law, and held the
    state responsible only for paying diyah (blood money) to the families. A
    separate lawsuit against the governor of Naqadeh at the time was dismissed
    by the Tehran Public Employees Court, which acquitted him. However,
    pressure on the victims families and restrictions on holding public
    memorials continued for years. Mr. Hamzeh Niazi s arbitrary execution
    According to available information, Mr. Niazi s name appears on the lists
    published by Azerbaijani activists documenting those killed during the
    Naqadeh protests. (Faza el Azizaan blog, May 31, 2009) However, there is
    no information about the circumstances of his death or his burial
