    Regulations on Controlling Protests There have been numerous reports of
    deaths during critical demonstrations in Iran. In many of these cases,
    armed forces have used firearms to suppress protests. Iranian law provides
    certain regulations regarding the use of firearms by armed forces during
    demonstrations. In addition, there are legal provisions in Iran for the
    punishment of officials who act unlawfully by firing weapons, as well as
    rules for the compensation of victims. This brief overview will review
    these provisions. The law allows armed forces officials to use firearms in
    certain situations, including to prevent riots and disorders. However, the
    law does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes riots and
    disorders. The Law on the Use of Firearms by the Armed Forces in Essential
    Cases, enacted in 1994, outlines specific conditions for the use of
    firearms. The main principle established by this law is that of necessity,
    meaning that armed forces officers may fire their weapons only in
    emergencies. Regarding protests, Articles 4 and 5 of this law allow
    officials to use their weapons under certain conditions to restore order
    and prevent riots. Article 4 states: "Police officers are authorized to
    use firearms to restore order and control illegal demonstrations, suppress
    riots and disorders that cannot be controlled without the use of weapons,
    upon the order of the commander of the operation, if the following
    conditions are met:". a) Other measures must have been tried first and
    proven ineffective. b) There must be a final warning to the rioters and
    insurgents before the use of firearms. Note 1: The determination of riots
    under Article 4 is the responsibility of the heads of the provincial and
    district security councils. In their absence, it is the responsibility of
    their deputies. If the governor has no political deputy, this
    responsibility is assigned to a member of the Security Council. Note 2: In
    cases where armed forces are assigned the task of restoring order and
    security under this article, they are also subject to the provisions of
    this article regarding the use of firearms. This article clearly states
    that armed personnel must first use non-lethal methods and only resort to
    firearms if those methods fail to control the situation. They must also
    warn the demonstrators. The law does not specify what other non-lethal
    methods should be used, but logically they would include things like water
    cannons, tear gas, and batons. This article refers to unarmed protests.
    For armed demonstrations, Article 5 states: "Military and police officers
    are authorized to use firearms to restore order and security during
    illegal armed demonstrations, riots and armed rebellions. Such forces are
    required to act immediately upon orders of the commander to r
