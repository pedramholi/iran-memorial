    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Shahbakhsh, known as Aqavak, son of
    Changiz, along with two other individuals, was announced by the website of
    Fars News Agency (December 24, 2006), Kayhan daily (December 25, 2006),
    and the website of Iscanews (January 10, 2007), all citing the Public
    Relations section of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Sistan
    and Baluchistan. Mr. Shahbakhsh s case pertains to murder, armed robbery,
    creating fear and trepidation, and participating in storing, carrying and
    sale of illegal drugs. Arrest and Detention There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Shahbakhsh s arrest and detention. Trial
    Mr. Shahbakhsh was tried by Branch One of the Revolutionary Court of
    Zahedan. However, there is no information available on the details of the
    session or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Shahbakhsh was charged with
    armed abduction, creating fear and trepidation, destroying the public
    peace and security, armed road-blocking, participating in storing,
    carrying and sale of illegal drugs (Fars News Agency; Kayhan daily). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt Possession of 227 kilograms of opium
    was entered as evidence of guilt against Mr. Shahbakhsh. Defense There is
    no information available on the details of Mr. Shahbakhsh s defense.
    Judgment Branch One of the Revolutionary Court of Zahedan designated Mr.
    Mohammad Shahbakhsh as Mohareb and Mofsed-e Fel Arz (sower of corruption
    on earth), and sentenced him to two times of execution. The verdict was
    approved by the Supreme Court. Mr. Shahbakhsh was hanged publicly, along
    with two other individuals, at the Karegar Square of Zahedan on Sunday,
    December 24, 2006.
