    News of the execution of Mr. Babak Karimkhani, along with two other
    individuals, was announced by Javan Daily and Iran Daily (January 21,
    2006). Additional information on this case was obtained from Kayhan Daily
    (July 16, 2003), Ettela at Daily and Hamshahri Daily (September 28, 2004),
    and the website of Jam-e Jam (July 21, 2010). The case of Mr. Karimkhani
    along with his wife* pertains to the murder of two individuals, as well as
    robbery in the Hovayzeh Street of Tehran on July 14, 2003. Arrest and
    Detention According to the available information, Mr. Karimkhani and his
    wife were arrested by the agents of Police Station 104 of Abbasabad a few
    hours after the occurrence of a murder on Monday, July 13, 2003. He spent
    two years in prison. However, there is no information available on the
    details of Mr. Karimkhani s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Karimkhani and
    his wife were tried by Branch 74 of the Public Court of Tehran (Javan
    daily). However, there is no information available on the session or
    sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Karimkhani was charged with involvement
    in the murder of a mother and her daughter (Hamshahri Daily). The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offenses,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence of guilt entered
    against Mr. Karimkhani was the discovery of the dead bodies of a mother
    and daughter, the discovery of a stolen car, and the confessions of the
    defendants. Mr. Karimkhani and his wife confessed that they had known the
    murdered mother and daughter three months prior to the incident, and that
    Mr. Karimkhani s wife used to work for them (Kayhan Daily). International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    In the course of his confessions, Mr. Karimkhani stated that the murdered
    person had forced his wife to sign a confession for pilfering that she had
    not committed. In order to solve the problem, Mr. Karimkhani had gone to
    the house of the would-be victims to argue with them and prove to them
    that there had not been any pilfering by his wife. But the victims would
    not give in, and instead struggled against Mr. Karimkhani s attempts to
    obtain the signed confession. However, there is no information available
    on the details of Mr. Karimkhani s defense. Judgment Branch 74 of the
    Public Court of Tehran sentenced Mr. Karimkhani to death. Branch 2 of the
    Supreme Court approved the verdict. Mr. Karimkhani was hanged , along with
    his wife and another individual, in Evin Prison on Wednesday, January 18,
    2006. ------------------------- *Raheleh Afrajudi
