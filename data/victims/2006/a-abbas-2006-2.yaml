    News of the execution of Mr. Abbas A., known as Za bil, was announced by
    the website of Fars News Agency citing the Public Relations Section of the
    provincial Ministry of Justice office of Khuzestan Province (October 2,
    2006), the website of Iscanews (November 8, 2006), and Hambastegi daily
    (November 9, 2006). Additional information on this case was obtained from
    Sharq daily and Kayhan daily citing the head of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Ahvaz (June 6, 2005). The case of Mr. Abbas A,. along with 12
    other individuals, pertains to the murder of a little girl and an agent of
    the police force in Ramhormoz, armed robbery of the villagers cattle, and
    creating fear and trepidation in Khuzestan. One of the members of this
    group of defendants passed away during the investigation due to heart
    failure. Arrest and Detention Mr. Abbas A. was identified and arrested by
    the police force of Khuzestan Province after they had received numerous
    complaints from people who had been attacked by a band of robbers or lost
    their belongings to them. However, there is no information available on
    the details of Mr. Abbas A. s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Abbas A. and
    the other 11 individuals incriminated in this case were tried by Branch
    One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz. However, there is no
    information available on the session or sessions of their trial. Charges
    Mr. Abbas A. was charged with armed robbery and murder, as well as
    creating fear and trepidation. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The
    evidence of guilt entered against Mr. Abbas A. and the other 11
    constituted the following: the complaints of the robbed people, the
    confessions of the defendants, the robbery of more than 22 calves, 104
    sheep, more than one million toomans in cash, some gold, cloth, cameras,
    television sets, a hunting rifle, two cars, possession of two AK-47
    assault rifles along with three magazines and 654 bullets, two Colt
    revolvers and 211 bullets, one Berno rifle, and a hunting rifle with 54
    bullets. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Abbas A. s defense. Judgment Branch One of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz sentenced Mr. Abbas A. to death,
    30 lashes and 5 million rials of fine. The verdict was approved by Branch
    27 of the Supreme Court. Mr. Abbas A. was hanged to death in the Karoun
    Prison of Ahvaz in 2006. Of the other 10 individuals implicated in this
    case, 2 received death sentences, 2 amputation sentences (their right arms
    and left legs were severed) as well as 10 years of imprisonment, and the
    rest collectively received 70 years of imprisonment and 518 lashes. The
    arms and legs of two of the 10 were amputated at the same time that Mr.
    Abbas A. was being hanged on the gallows.
