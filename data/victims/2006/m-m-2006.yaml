    News of the execution of Mr. M. M. was announced by the website of Iranian
    Students News Agency ISNA (November 8, 2006) and E temad daily (November
    9, 2006), both citing the Public Relations section of the provincial
    Ministry of Justice office of Hormozgan. The news was also announced by
    the website of Khabar-e Jonoub (November 11, 2006). Mr. M. M. was from
    Bandar Abbas, and his case pertains to the murder of a Bangladeshi citizen
    in the vicinity of the Towhid Township in Bandar Abbas in the winter of
    1998. Arrest and detention Mr. M. M. was arrested after the police
    investigation and interrogation of the brothers-in-law of the victim had
    produced contradictory accounts. In addition, Mr. M. M. had confessed to
    the murder to one of his relatives, which became another clue for his
    prosecution. Mr. M. M. spent seven years in prison. Trial Mr. M. M. was
    tried by the Public Court of the provincial Ministry of Justice office.
    However, there is no information available on the details of the session
    or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. M. M. was charged with murder. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The discovery of the body of the victim, the
    contradictions in the testimonies of the witnesses, and the defendant s
    confessions were entered as evidence of guilt against Mr. M. M.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense The victim was the husband of the defendant s
    sister. He had repeatedly beaten Mr. M. M. s sister, which could have been
    the cause of his fatal struggle with the victim. However, there is no
    information available on the details of Mr. M. M. s defense. Judgment The
    Public Court of the provincial Ministry of Justice office sentenced Mr. M.
    M. to death. The Supreme Court validated the verdict in 2002. However, as
    the case had no plaintiffs, carrying out the sentence was postponed for
    four years. Eventually, the judiciary authorities used their legal
    privileges to carry out the sentence. Mr. M. M. was hanged in Bandar Abbas
    Central Prison on November 8, 2006. According to the authorities, the
    communications between the Iranian Foreign Ministry and the Iranian
    Embassy in Bangladesh to identify the family of the victim had led to no
    results.
