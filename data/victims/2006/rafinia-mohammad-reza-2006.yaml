    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Rafi nia, aka Mohammad Khan
    Rafi ee, son of Mahmud, was published on the Kerna News website - the city
    of Kerman news website (November 26, 2006), in Kayhan newspaper, Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper (November 27, 2006), and Javan newspaper, the latter
    quoting the Kerman Prosecutor (November 27, 2006). Additional information
    about this case was obtained from Mr. Rafi nia s personal weblog entitled
    My Observations (Notes) (April 7, and 9, 2008). He has written about the
    manner of his arrest and of his trial in his weblog, and has published the
    Court Decision and the Supreme Court Decision therein. Mr. Rafi nia was a
    well-known figure in the city of Kerman. According to official
    information, he had been arrested a number of times between 1997 and
    2003-04, for having been involved in street fights and altercations. Upon
    a complaint by a mother who had claimed that her daughter had been
    kidnapped by Mr. Rafi nia, the police planned and arrested him on January
    17, 2002, with the help of the mother. He was in detention for a month and
    was released upon the order of the General Court Branch Ten, based on the
    girl s testimony, who was his girlfriend. There is other information to
    the effect that Mr. Rafi nia was a kind man, ready to help others. People
    would come to him for his help in teaching a lesson to people who harassed
    them. According to available information, his case and those of 32 other
    individuals are related to drug crimes, sexual offenses, participating in
    armed robbery, and endangering public order. Mr. Rafi nia s last case is
    related to a Court decision issued in a 2003-04 trial, in which he had not
    been present. Arrest and detention On November 10, 2003, Mr. Rafi nia was
    arrested in Shiraz by the Kerman and Shiraz Information General
    Administration and taken to Kerman Prison. According to available
    information, in May-June 2002, the Kerman Resistance Guards agents
    attempted to arrest Mr. Rafi nia and his accomplices; Mr. Rafi nia fled
    but 13 other individuals were arrested. The agents were able to identify
    his hiding place in Shiraz after a short while and proceeded to arrest
    him. (General Court Branch Seven Decision). He was incarcerated at Kerman
    Prison for a while and was subsequently transferred to [the town of]
    Jiroft Prison. On November 25, 2006, Mr. Rafi nia was transferred to
    Kerman Prison without his family s knowledge. He spent three years in
    Kerman s prisons. Another report states that subsequent to the arrest and
    detention of several individuals who were in contact with Mr. Rafi nia,
    Kerman s Bassij Resistance opened a case against him. He initially went to
    Tehran n order to hide, and subsequently to Shiraz to be close to his
    girlfriend. The girl s mother found out, however, and called the agents.
    The latter surrounded him when he was returning from a repair shop and
    beat him up with the stock of a rifle, breaking his nose. The agents
    arrested and transferred him from Shiraz to Kerman. (Mr. Rafi nia s
    weblog). Trial Kerman General Court Branch Seven tried Mr. Rafi nia. He
    had an attorney. The case was adjudicated in Kerman General Court Branch
    Ten, which was later changed to Branch Seven, with a special decree and on
    the order of the Islamic Republic s Supreme Leader . Trial sessions
    convened on July 25, 2006, November 11, 2006, and January 5, 2007.
    (Supreme Court Decision, October 11, 2006). On November 19, 2002, Kerman
    General Court Branch Ten tried Mr. Rafi nia and 13 other individuals in
    his absence. All 13 individuals were tried and sentenced. Citing Article
    265(b) of the Law on the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Supreme Court
    ruled that the sentences regarding the crimes of forcible rape, armed
    robbery, theft involving harassment, and kidnapping, were defective due to
    defects in the investigations, the proceedings, and the absence of the
    plaintiffs in court, but declared that there was sufficient evidence
    regarding other charges, and remanded the case for de novo hearing to
    Kerman General Court Branch Ten. (Supreme Court Decision, October 22,
    2003). Charges Kerman Deputy Prosecutor announced the charges against Mr.
    Rafi nia as creating fear and apprehension, depriving the populace of
    their freedom and security, non-Hadd theft, drinking alcoholic beverages,
    kidnapping, and [religiously] prohibited [sexual] relations . (Supreme
    Court Decision, October 11, 2006). The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following ju
