    was arrested and returned to jail, despite being released on an indefinite
    leave permission . To protest his arrest, he went on hunger strike. Nine
    days later, he died in Evin Prison. Information regarding Mr. Akbar
    Mohammadi s death in detention was announced by the websites of ISNA-
    Iranian Student s News Agency (July 31, August 10, and September 17,
    2006), IRNA- Islamic Republic News Agency (August 1, 2006), ILNA- Iranian
    Labour News Agency (July 31, 2006), Peyk-e Iran (August 8, September 8,
    10, 11, and 14, 2006), Advar News (September 5, 2006), Jaam-e Jam (August
    3, 2006), Aftab News Agency (July 31, 2006), Iran Press News (July 31 and
    August 3, 2006), Entekhab News Agency (August 12, 2006), Student Committee
    of Human Rights Reporters (July 31, 2006), and Kourosh News Agency (June
    3, 2005). Additional information in this regard was obtained through
    Boroumand Center research and interviews with Mr. Omid Abasgholinezhad
    (September 16, 2017), Amnesty International Report (July 7, 2004), and
    Thought and Whip : Prison Memoirs of Akbar Mohammadi (Shahr-e-Ketab
    Publisher, LA, 2006). Mr. Akbar Mohammadi was born in Amol, Mazandaran
    province in 1969. He was a social work student at the College of Welfare
    and Rehabilitation Sciences of Tehran University and a member of the
    National Association of Students and Graduates. According to one of
    Mohammadi's cellmates in Evin Prison, he was very friendly, kind, and
    calm, and at the same time strong, patriotic, and sympathetic to the newly
    arrived prisoners (Boroumand Center interviews with Mr. Omid
    Abasgholinezhad, September 16, 2017). The National Association of Students
    and Graduates (Anjoman-e Daneshjuyan va Daneshamukhtegan Melli), founded
    in 1997, was an independent secular nationalist student association. The
    group joined the United Students Front, a coalition of students and
    graduate groups formed in 1997, during the relatively open period that
    followed the presidential election. The group promoted democracy and
    cleared a way for independent student associations. The National
    Association of Students and Graduates was active in organizing meetings
    and protests to give visibility to students grievances and demands. During
    the July 1999 protests (the protests that were started peacefully in the
    University of Tehran's dormitories due to forced closure of the Salam
    newspaper and the adoption of the new press law, but were raided by riot
    police and Ansar-e Hezbollah (plain-clothes officers) the same night, and
    became the biggest challenge to the student movement in Iran after the
    1979 revolution*) the leaders of the association were arrested and
    sentenced to death. Their sentences were later commuted. The organization
    was de facto dissolved inside Iran with the death of one of the founders
    in prison and the escape into exile of the other founder. The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court ultimately banned the United Students Front in 2004.
    "He was very friendly, kind, and calm, and at the same time strong,
    patriotic, and sympathetic to the newly arrived prisoners", said one of
    Mr. Mohammadi's cellmates in Evin Prison. The July 9, 1999 Incident In the
    early morning hours of July 9, the day after students demonstrations to
    denounce the closing of the daily newspaper Salam, members of the Riot
    Guards, along with members of government supported militia in civilian
    clothes, known as Hezbollah s Aides, raided the dormitories of the
    University of Tehran and began battering and seriously injuring many
    students, some of whom had been barely awake. The invaders then proceeded
    to savagely ransack the rooms and destroy or pilfer the students
    belongings. The raid was apparently a reaction to the gathering of
    students to protest the closing of the reformist daily journal, Salam. The
    protests had flared up following the publication of a letter by Said Emami
    (one of the undersecretaries of the Ministry of Information who had been
    accused of complicity in the serial murders of opponents and critics of
    the regime). The letter disclosed a government plan to tighten control
    over newspapers. An announcement posted on campus bulletin boards, called
    on students to congregate in protest to the restrictions imposed on, and
    the closing of, dissident journals. Answering the call, several hundred
    students gathered in front of the campus gate and began to shout slogans
    in praise of freedom and condemnation of tyranny. The students continued
    their march from the campus area to an adjacent street and finally
    returned to their dormitories. Some of the students, however, noticing the
    presence of security forces and plain-clothes militia, remained in the
    street. Following a brief skirmish with the militia, they returned to
    their dormitories at the request of the president of the university. Later
    on, following the raid of the dormitories by the riot police and
    plain-clothes militia, a number of students and the university president
    were arrested and taken away. Denouncing the violent and destructive
    police raid
