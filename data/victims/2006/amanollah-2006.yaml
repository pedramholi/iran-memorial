    News of the execution of Mr. Amanollah (without stating his family name),
    son of Adineh, was announced by Islamic Republic daily (December 30, 2006)
    citing the Public and Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor of Saravan County.
    Mr. Amanollah s case pertains to possessing illegal firearms, armed
    robbery and obstructing roads. Arrest and detention Mr. Amanollah was
    arrested after he had obstructed the Ghafourabad-Kulu road in Saravan
    County. However, there is no further information available on the details
    of his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Amanollah was tried by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Zahedan. However, there is no information available
    on the details of the session or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr.
    Amanollah was charged with armed robbery. Before his last arrest, he had
    spent some time in prison and then obtained a furlough on bail, during
    which he obstructed the Ghafourabad-Kulu road. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt Having criminal records was entered
    as evidence of guilt against Mr. Amanollah. Defense There is no
    information available on the details of Mr. Amanollah s defense. Judgment
    Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Zahedan sentenced Mr.
    Amanollah to death. The verdict was validated by the Supreme Court. Mr.
    Amanollah was publicly hanged in Saravan County on December 29, 2006.
