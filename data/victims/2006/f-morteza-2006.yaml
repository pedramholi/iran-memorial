    News of the execution of Mr. Morteza F. was announced by the website of
    IRNA (April 19, 2006) citing the head of the provincial Ministry of
    Justice office of Fars Province. Additional information on this case was
    obtained from the website of the Central Organization for Penitentiary
    Centers of Fars Province (July 9, 2005) citing the head of the Public
    Court of Fars Province. Mr. Morteza F., 21, was a resident of Darab
    County. His case pertains to the murder of a person in Darab County in
    2004. Arrest and detention There is no information available on the
    details of Mr. Morteza F. s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Morteza F. was
    tried by the Public Court of Fars Province. During the sessions of this
    trial all the authorities of the Public Court of the province, the
    representative of the prosecutor, and the families of the defendant and
    the victim were present (Central Organization for Penitentiary Centers of
    Fars Province). However, there is no information available on the details
    of the session or sessions of Mr. Morteza F. s trial. Charges Mr. Morteza
    F. was charged with murder. According to the head of the Public Court of
    Fars Province, the incident stemmed from the fact that a while before it
    actually took place, the defendant s sister had been beaten by the victim
    s brother, on account of which she had even been hospitalized for a
    period. Since then, the defendant and his family had developed a grudge
    against the victim and looked for an opportunity to retaliate. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr. Morteza F.
    Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr. Morteza F.
    s defense. Judgment The Public Court of Fars Province sentenced Mr.
    Morteza F. to death. He was hanged in Darab County in 2006.
