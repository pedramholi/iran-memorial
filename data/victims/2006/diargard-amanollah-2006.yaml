    News of the execution of Mr. Amanollah Diargard, son of Gholam, his
    brother, and one other individual was published on the IRNA website
    (September 21, 2006), in Etemed-e Melli newspaper and on Yazd-e Farda
    website (September 22, 2006), as well as on the country s Prosecutor
    General website (October 4, 2006), quoting the Bafq County General and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor. Additional information about this case was
    obtained from Yazd-e Farda website (September 29, 2005, and February 6,
    2006) and Khatam newspaper (February 21 and 25, 2006). Mr. Diargard was
    born, married, and resided in [the city of] Zabol. His case and the case
    of 6 other individuals was related to drug crimes, armed skirmish, and the
    killing of two persons on September 24, 2005, in the Bafq to Yazd road.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Diargard was arrested in Khomeini Shahr in
    Esfahan [Province] by Esfahan police officers. He spent one year in
    prison. He was tortured while undergoing interrogations in Yazd and
    Esfahan prisons. (Khatam newspaper). Trial Yazd Province Criminal Court,
    Branch One, comprised of four judges and a presiding judge, tried Mr.
    Diargard and six other defendants at the Yazd County Judiciary [Complex].
    The first public trial session convened on Sunday, February 5, 2006. More
    than five sessions were conducted in trying the defendants. The defendants
    attorneys were present at trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Diargard
    were stated to have been armed traffic of narcotic drugs, transportation
    and possession of narcotic drugs, addiction to narcotic drugs . (State
    Prosecutor General). According to available information, on the day of the
    events, several individuals transporting narcotics engaged in skirmishes
    with [law enforcement] officers during a chase, in the course of which two
    officers were killed and another individual was injured. (Yazd-e Farda
    website). The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Diargard and the other defendants was stated to have been
    possession of 540 kilograms of opium and 135 kilograms of hashish and
    morphine, the defendants confessions, testimony of eyewitnesses, and a
    firearm . International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Diargard stated in his own
    defense that he, his wife, and his brother were only facilitating the
    process and accepted that he had transported some amount of opium and
    burnt opium but absolutely denied the murder of two people. In defense of
    Mr. Diargard and of the other defendants, his attorney stated that the
    traffic of narcotic drugs was carried out by professional drug traffickers
    and that the defendants had cooperated in that exercise but that another
    individual had played the main role. He asked for an expert s opinion and
    for the presence of a communications expert in court to provide his
    opinion regarding the cell phones and the reports of the Communications
    [Ministry]. He also asked the court that an expert analysis be conducted
    regarding the speed of the defendants automobile which was carrying 500
    kilos of cargo and three passengers, and had a flat tire. He stated: It is
    not possible for a car in such conditions to move at a speed of 200
    kilometers (120 miles) per hour. (Khatam newspaper). Summary of the
    defects of Mr. Amanollah Diargard s legal proceedings What can be observed
    in this case is that there were multiple defendants and it is not exactly
    clear which one committed what crime. In other words, the investigations
    conducted by the prosecutor s office and the court were not able to
    establish the extent of each of the defendants role in committing murder
    and transporting narcotic drugs. It appears that this was the main reason
    for convening at least five trial sessions at the Yazd Province Criminal
    Court. The statements made by the prosecutor s representative and the
    defendant s attorney indicate that sufficient investigations were not
