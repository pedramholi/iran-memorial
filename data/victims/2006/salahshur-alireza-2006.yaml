    News of Mr. Alireza Salahshur s execution was published in Hamshahri
    newspaper, quoting Esfahan Police Chief s Reporting Center in Khorassan
    and Iran newspapers (March 6, 2006). Additional information about this
    case was obtained from Hamshahri newspaper (July 14, 2005) and Iran
    newspaper (March 5, 2006). His case and that of four other individuals is
    related to the sexual assault of an individual, and disrupting public
    order on July 2, 2004, at Ziar, a village located to the east of the city
    of Esfahan. Arrest and detention Mr. Salahshur and four others were
    arrested in July 2004 by Esfahan s Dashti Region Police. He was in prison
    for a year and a half. There is no information about details of his arrest
    and detention, however. Trial Esfahan General Court Branch 11 tried Mr.
    Salahshur and the other defendants in the case over several sessions.
    There is no information regarding the trial session(s). Charges Mr.
    Salahshur was charged with two counts of murder, and disruption of public
    order . According to the murder victims nephew, Mr. Salahshur had come
    back to the village on leave from his mandatory military service, and gone
    out of the village with his friends on an excursion. As [the victim of
    sexual assault] was making his way back to the village to do some
    shopping, he was kidnapped by Mr. Salahshur and five of his friends, taken
    to a utility room where he was sexually assaulted and videotaped. He was
    then left on the side of the road. He told what had transpired to his two
    uncles, who subsequently went to Mr. Salahshur s brother s store to
    protest what had happened, when Mr. Salahshur and his friends attacked the
    two brothers and stabbed both of them to death. (Iran newspaper). Evidence
    of guilt The evidence used against Mr. Salahshur was the murder victims
    family s complaint, the defendants confessions, testimony of eyewitnesses,
    and the Medical Examiner s report . Defense Pursuant to Iranian laws and
    regulations, including the Note to Article 59 of the Law on the General
    and Revolutionary Courts Rules of Criminal Procedure, admissions and
    confessions to crimes are legally valid only if made before the judge who
    issues a ruling in the case. Therefore, confessions made before the
    investigating judge or law enforcement officials cannot be cited as
    evidence in the judge s ruling. The Law on General and Revolutionary
    Courts Rules of Criminal Procedure, Note to Article 59 provides: In cases
    where the court issues a ruling based on the defendant s confession, or a
    witness testimony, or a testimony about a witness testimony, it is
    mandatory that such confession and/or testimony be made before the court.
    According to the ruling issued in this case, the Defendant had made no
    admission to sodomy at trial; however, since he had made a confession to
    having committed said crime in the preliminary investigations stage, he
    was sentenced to 74 lashes. It is not clear on what charge the court
    sentenced the Defendant to flogging. In any event, however, the court s
    reliance on a confession made in the preliminary investigations phase to
    issue a ruling, without any other evidence, was illegal. There is no
    information about any other defense he may have presented. Judgment
    Esfahan General Court Branch 11 sentenced Mr. Alireza Salahshur to two
    death sentences for the two counts of murder, to 8 years in prison and 50
    lashes on the charge of disruption of public order, and to 74 lashes for
    having confessed to the commission of sodomy before law enforcement
    authorities and the court. The ruling was upheld by Supreme Court Branch
    32. On March 5, 2006, Mr. Slahshur was hanged in public in the village of
    Ziar s main square. The other defendants in the case were also sentenced
    to flogging in public, exile, and prison.
