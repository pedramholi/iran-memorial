    News of the execution of Mr. Abbas Mo'tamedian was announced by the news
    website of the police (January 30, 2006) and the website of Javan Daily
    (February 2, 2006). His case pertains to abduction, armed struggle,
    purchase and sale of illegal drugs, and endangering public safety in the
    Kerman Province area. Mr. Mo'tamedian s last instance of hostage-taking
    occurred on May 31, 2005. Arrest and Detention There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Mo'tamedian s arrest and detention. Trial
    Mr. Mo'tamedian was tried by Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Kerman. However, there is no information available on the session or
    sessions of Mr. Mo'tamedian s trial. Charges Mr. Mo'tamedian was charged
    with armed struggle, abduction, endangering public safety in the region,
    and purchase and sale of illegal drugs. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt Having criminal records in 9 counts
    of abduction was the evidence of guilt that was entered against Mr.
    Mo'tamedian. Defense There is no information available on the details of
    Mr. Mo'tamedian s defense. Judgment Branch One of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Kerman sentenced Mr. Abbas Mo'tamedian to death. He
    was publicly hanged in the Shohada Square of the city of Kerman on January
    30, 2006.
