    News of the execution of Mr. Azizollah Najarian, son of Shir Mohammad, was
    announced by Islamic Republic daily on November 2, 2006. His case pertains
    to carrying and storing narcotics. Arrest and detention There is no
    information available on the details of Mr. Najarian s arrest and
    detention. Trial Mr. Najarian was tried by the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Zahedan. However, there is no information available on the details of
    the session or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Najarian was charged
    with carrying and storing heroin. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    Possessing 6 kilograms and 400 grams of heroin was entered as evidence of
    guilt against Mr. Najarian. Defense There is no information available on
    the details of Mr. Najarian s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Zahedan sentenced Mr. Azizollah Najarian to death. The verdict
    was validated by high-echelon judiciary authorities. Mr. Najarian was
    publicly hanged, along with another individual, in Zahedan on Wednesday,
    November 1, 2006.
