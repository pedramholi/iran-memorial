    Hemat Esmzadeh was interested in Azerbaijani culture and knew Azerbaijani
    songs and dances. Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Mr.
    Hemat Esmzadeh, son of Ali, was obtained from the Shahidler websites (July
    28, 2007; February 24, 2008; August 26, 2008), the Southern Azerbaijan
    Democratic Union (April 10 and May 22, 2018), Gunaz TV (October 20, 2021),
    and Voice of America (January 16, 2008; May 25, 2008). Additional
    information was gathered from the BBC Persian website (May 28, 2006),
    Radio Farda (May 31, 2006; June 22, 2006; May 29, 2011), and Asr-e Nou
    (September 4, 2008). Hemat Esmzadeh was born in the Forudabad neighborhood
    of Naqadeh, West Azerbaijan Province, into a large family with six
    brothers and one sister. From an early age, he helped support his family
    by working with his father distributing heating oil. Although Mr. Esmzadeh
    had worked since childhood, he still managed to graduate from high school.
    However, financial difficulties prevented him from pursuing further
    education. He later bought a shop in Naqadeh s fruit and vegetable market,
    where he worked and eventually started a family. By age thirty-five, he
    had a three-year-old daughter named Mina. People who knew him described
    him as kind and cheerful. From adolescence, he developed a strong interest
    in Azerbaijani culture and learned the songs and dances of the Qarapapaq
    tribe, one of the Azerbaijani ethnic groups. As the national-democratic
    movement in Azerbaijan grew, Hemat also became familiar with political
    issues and, together with other political activists from Naqadeh,
    participated in the annual commemorative ceremonies for Babak
    Khorramdin(*) at Babak Castle. Hemat Esmzadeh participated in the Naqadeh
    protests on May 24 and 25, 2006. On May 24, he and other protesters
    gathered in front of Payam Noor University and then marched toward the
    Governor s Office while chanting slogans. At the end of that
    demonstration, they agreed to meet again the next day to continue the
    protest. (Southern Azerbaijan Democratic Union, May 22, 2018) Background
    of the 2006 Azerbaijan Protests On May 12, 2006, the state-run Iran
    newspaper published a cartoon in its Friday edition. In the cartoon, a
    cockroach responds to a child speaking to it in Azerbaijani with the
    question, "Nemanə?" (meaning "What?"). Many Azerbaijani readers
    interpreted the cartoon as equating the Azeri people with cockroaches,
    viewing it as an explicit insult to the Azerbaijani community in Iran. The
    authorities' longstanding refusal to allow education in mother tongues in
    schools had already created tensions among Azerbaijanis. News of the
    cartoon s publication, coupled with the lack of an official response to
    initial protests mainly organized in universities sparked a wave of street
    demonstrations beginning in late May 2006. In Tabriz, Urmia, Ardabil,
    Zanjan, Marand, Maragheh, Ahar, Khalkhal, Khoy, Miyaneh, and Solduz
    (Naqadeh), protesters chanted slogans such as "Haray, haray, men Turkam"
    ("Cry out, cry out, I am a Turk"), demanding the suspension of Iran
    newspaper and a formal apology from high-ranking officials. As the
    protests escalated on May 23, 2006, the government officially condemned
    the cartoon as an "insult to Iranians." The judiciary ordered the
    suspension of Iran newspaper and the arrest of its editor and cartoonist.
    A motion to impeach the Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance was
    raised in Parliament. Though these measures were intended to quell the
    unrest, they failed to calm public anger. On May 24, 2006, as
    demonstrations intensified in Tabriz, then-President Mahmud Ahmadinejad
    accused the United States of plotting to incite ethnic division. The
    judiciary and police in East Azerbaijan announced the arrest of more than
    50 individuals in connection with the protests. Iranian officials
    continued to attribute the protests to foreign interference and warned of
    harsh measures against demonstrators in Azerbaijan. The following day, in
    the city of Naqadeh (West Azerbaijan Province), police and Basij forces
    opened fire on protesters marching toward the governor s office. In
    response to this violent crackdown, thousands of demonstrators in Tabriz
    threw stones at government buildings and banks. Riot police across various
    cities used tear gas, batons, and, in some cases, live ammunition against
    the crowds. According to Azerbaijani activists and Amnesty International,
    at least 20 people were killed and dozens more were injured during the
    protests. However, Brigadier General Hassan Karami, the then-commander of
    the West Azerbaijan police, reported a lower toll of four dead and 43
    injured. On May 28, 2006, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described
    the demonstrators as agents of "the enemy" and declared: "The enemies do
    not know Azerbaijan; Azerbaijan belongs to the Islamic Revolution." Other
    officials echoed this sentiment in the days that followed. On May 29, the
    Minister of the Interior accused the United States of fueling the unrest.
