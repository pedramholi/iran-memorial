    Mr. Shiri was a quiet, ordinary boy who minded his own business and did
    not get involved in others affairs while in prison. News of the execution
    of Mr. Satar Shiri and one other person was published by various sources
    including Iscanews and the Iranian Student News Agency (September 6,
    2006.) Additional information was taken from an interview by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with his cellmate (ABF interview) and an
    interview by the Committee of Human Rights Reporters with his cellmate on
    January 8, 2009, as well as other sources.* Mr. Shiri was single and
    resided in Eslamshahr. According to his cellmate he was a quiet, ordinary
    boy who minded his business and did not get involved in the affairs of
    other prisoners (ABF interview). His case was related to a group fight
    over a public phone in Eslamshahr that resulted in the murder of a young
    man on February 13, 2004. He was 17 years old at the time of the incident.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention
    on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and
    detention Agents of Police Station 11 in Eslamshahr arrested Mr. Shiri in
    Eslamshahr during an investigation into the murder of a young man in a
    public phone kiosk in February of 2004. The circumstances of his arrest
    and detention are not known. Mr. Shiri was detained at the Rehabilitation
    and Correction Center for juvenile defendants for about a year. He was
    transferred to the Raja ishahr Prison some time before his execution.
    Trial Branch 71 of the Criminal Court in Tehran tried Mr. Shiri in the
    presence of five judges. No information is available on his trial or
    whether he had an attorney. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Shiri
    was announced as murder. He was accused of killing a young man with knife
    stabs during a group fight over the use of a public phone. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    The evidence presented against Mr. Shiri was his confession and the
    testimony of a witness (ISNA.) International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Shiri was younger than 18
    at the time of the crime. No information is available on his defense. He
    had stated that he had no intention to kill the victim. After the victim
    used a public telephone for a long period of time, Shiri became angry and
    fought with him, a confrontation which ended in the victim s death.
    Judgment Branch 71 of the Criminal Court in Tehran condemned Mr. Satar
    Shiri to death. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling in June of 2005
    (Sharq newspaper.) He was hanged along with one other person at Evin
    Prison in Tehran on September 6, 2006. Three other defendants of the same
    case were condemned to three years imprisonment each for participation in
    murder (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper.) __________________ * Other sources:
