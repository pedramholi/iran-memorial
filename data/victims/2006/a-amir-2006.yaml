    News of the execution of Mr. Amir A. was announced by E temad-e Melli
    daily citing the Public Relations Section of the provincial Ministry of
    Justice office of Khuzestan Province (November 4, 2006) and the website of

    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations

    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
