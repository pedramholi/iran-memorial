    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports

    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt Possession of 60
    kilograms of opium as well as 1 kilogram and 421 grams of heroin was
    entered as evidence of guilt against Mr. Mohammad D. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    There is no information available on the details of Mr. Mohammad D. s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Birjand sentenced Mr.
    Mohammad D. to death. He was hanged in the Salman Operations Center in the
    Khorasan-e Jonoubi region on February 22, 2006.
