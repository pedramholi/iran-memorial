    News of the execution of Mr. Habib Dusti Shahrestanaki was announced by
    the website of Fars News Agency (March 7, 2005), Iran daily (March 8,
    2005), and Islamic Republic daily (March 9, 2005). The case of Mr. Dusti
    Shahrestanaki, and three other individuals, pertains to creating a
    criminal ring for the purpose of armed robbery in the cities of Tehran and
    Qazvin, as well as the Saveh Road and the Rasht Road in 2004. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Dusti Shahrestanaki was arrested after a clash with the
    police force of Qazvin in March-April 2004. He spent one year in prison.
    However, there is no information available on the details of Mr. Dusti
    Shahrestanaki s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Dusti Shahrestanaki was
    tried by Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qazvin. However,
    there is no information available on the details of the session or
    sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Dusti Shahrestanaki was charged with
    armed robbery as well as moharebeh (armed struggle against the holy state
    (Iran daily). In another news item, the charges brought against him were
    stated in more detail as armed robbery of Pride and Peugeot cars;
    threatening; robbery of a Paykan car and its dismantling to pieces;
    carrying four packages of heroin; shooting and wounding a police agent
    with firearms; armed robbery of a motorcycle; smoking opium and robbing a
    gas station (Fars News Agency and Islamic Republic daily). The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt Having criminal records in robbery
    and escaping from prison while on furlough under supervision were entered
    as evidence of guilt against Mr. Dusti Shahrestanaki. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    Mr. Dusti Shahrestanaki objected to the ruling of the court, upon which
    his case was referred to the Supreme Court. However, there is no further
    information available on the details of his defense. Judgment Branch Two
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qazvin designated Mr. Habib Dusti
    Shahrestanaki as mohareb (armed struggler against the holy state) and
    sentenced him to death. The verdict was validated by the Supreme Court.
    Mr. Dusti Shahrestanaki was publicly hanged in the Darvazeh Rasht-Qazvin
    area on March 7, 2005. He also received 50 lashes before he was hanged.
