    News of the execution of Mr. Kodadad D., son of Mirza Hafez, along with
    another individual was announced by the websites of Central Justice Office
    (January 10, 2007) and Iscanews (March 11, 2007). His case, and that of
    two others, pertains to trafficking illegal drugs in the area along the
    border between Iran and Afghanistan during June/July 2006. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Kodadad D. was arrested along with two others by the police
    force on the border on July 2, 2007 and he spent six months in prison.
    Trial Mr. Kodadad D. and two other defendants were tried by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Qaen County in Khorasan-e Jonoubi Province.
    However, there is no information available on the details of the session
    or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Kodadad D. was charged with
    trafficking illegal drugs. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The discovery of 64 kilograms of opium in three backpacks as well as
    the confessions of the defendants were entered as evidence of guilt
    against Mr. Kodadad D. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Kodadad D. s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Qaen sentenced Mr. Kodadad D. to death. The verdict
    was validated by the Supreme Court as well as the Chief Public Prosecutor.
    Mr. Kodadad D. was hanged, along with another individual, in Qaen County
    on December 21, 2006. The case of the third defendant was reviewed in view
    of his new confessions.
