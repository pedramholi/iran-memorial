    News of the execution of Mr. Arash Shahbazi was announced by Hamshahri
    Daily, Islamic Republic Daily, Kayhan Daily (January 25, 2006) and Iran

    premeditated murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    Having a criminal record of seven counts of robbery, knife-wielding and
    getting drunk was entered against Mr. Shahbazi as evidence of his guilt.
    Defense There is no more information available on the details of Mr.
    Shahbazi s defense. Judgment Branch 47 of the Public Court of Isfahan

    37 of the Supreme Court. Mr. Shahbazi was publicly hanged at the crime
    scene in East Nazar Street of Isfahan (Alfred intersection) on January 24,
    2006.
