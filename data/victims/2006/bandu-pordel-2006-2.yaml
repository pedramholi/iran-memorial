    News of the execution of Mr. Pordel Bandu, known as Nalouk, son of
    Jahanshah, along with another individual ,was announced by the website of
    Iranian Students News Agency, ISNA (December 25, 2006), as well as the
    Islamic Republic daily (December 28, 2006) citing the Public Relations
    section of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Sistan and
    Baluchistan. Mr. Bandu s case is related to storing and carrying illegal
    drugs, armed struggle and storing arms. Arrest and Detention There is no
    information available on the details of Mr. Bandu s arrest and detention.
    Trial Mr. Bandu was tried by Branch One of the Revolutionary Court of
    Zahedan. There is no information available on the details of the session
    or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Bandu was charged with participating
    in storing and carrying illegal drugs, instigating armed struggle,
    committing murder and storing arms." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    Possessing 15 kilograms of opium as well as one AK-47 assault rifle along
    with related ammunition was entered against Mr. Bandu as evidence of
    guilt. Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr.
    Bandu s defense. Judgment Branch One of the Revolutionary Court of Zahedan
    sentenced Mr. Pordel Bandu to death. The verdict was approved by the
    Supreme Court. Mr. Bandu was hanged publicly, along with another
    individual, at the juncture of Janbazan and Behdasht boulevards of Zahedan
    in 2006.
