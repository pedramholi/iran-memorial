    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein B. was announced by the websites of
    the Police Center of Information (March 4, 2006), Jam-e Jam (March 5,
    2006), and Khabar-e Jonoub (March 6, 2006). Additional information on this
    case was obtained from Kayhan daily (June 1, 2006). Mr. Hossein B. was 24,
    and his case is related to a rape in the city of Qazvin in 2005. Arrest
    and Detention Mr. Hossein B. was arrested by agents of the Police Force in
    the city of Qazvin in 2005. According to the available information, after
    covering his face with a sock, he had entered a beauty salon for women;
    however, when the manager of the salon identified him, Mr. Hossein B. had
    been forced to flee the place. The police forces were informed of the
    situation and immediately attended the area and arrested Mr. Hossein B. He
    spent less than a year in prison. Trial Mr. Hossein B. was tried by Branch
    Three of the Public Court of Qazvin. However, there is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of Mr. Hossein B. s
    trial. Charges Mr. Hossein B. was charged with rape. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The complaints of the victims, the
    confessions of the accused, the report of the agents of the Police Force
    of Qazvin Province, and two previous records of rape were entered as
    evidence of guilt against Mr. Hossein B. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense There is no
    information available on the details of Mr. Hossein B. s defense. Judgment
    Branch Three of the Public Court of Qazvin sentenced Mr. Hossein B. to
    death. The verdict was approved by the Supreme Court. Mr. Hossein B. was
    hanged in the city of Qazvin on March 4, 2006.
