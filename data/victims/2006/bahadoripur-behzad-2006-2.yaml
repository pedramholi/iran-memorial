    News of the execution of Mr. Behzad Bahadoripur was reported by Fars and
    Mehr News Agency websites (July 11, 2006). Additional information on this
    case has been collected from Sharq newspaper (July 9, 2006), Javan
    newspaper, Khabar-e-Jonub site, and Hamshahri newspaper (July 10, 2006).
    Mr. Bahadoripur was married, lived in Bam, had grown up in Zahedan, and
    had gone to school through grade 11. His and his wife s case was related
    to kidnapping and rape. Arrest and detention Mr. Bahadoripur and his wife
    were arrested by Esfahan Police officers, on the Esfahan-Tehran road, near
    the town of Murcheh Khort, on November 4, 2004. This was in response to a
    complaint from the family of a kidnapped young girl in the town of Natanz.
    Investigating officers noticed that many people in different towns had
    gone to the police and reported that their daughters had been kidnapped by
    a young couple. For that reason, the Esfahan police force designated a
    special team for the arrest of these two people. They immediately put all
    the entrances and exits to the town of Natanz under surveillance, and they
    arrested these two on the road from Esfahan to Tehran, near the town of
    Murcheh Khort (Javan newspaper). He was in prison for nearly two years.
    The latter part of this incarceration was spent in Section 7, Penitentiary
    #3, Esfahan Prison (Hamshahri newspaper). Trial Branch 102 of the Tehran
    Criminal Court tried Mr. Bahadoripur and his wife. No information is
    available on this trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr.
    Bahadoripur was rape and kidnapping . The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their opponents
    (including political, civic, and trade union activists, and ethnic and
    religious minorities) and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Every year hundreds of people are
    sentenced to death by hanging in Iranian courts, but the exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    Evidence against Mr. Bahadoripur was complaints from 157 victims,
    identification of the accused by kidnapped children, possession of six and
    a half million Tumans cash, and confessions of the accused . In their
    confessions, they said they had decided to do this in the spring of 2002.
    In different towns, they would lure young girls into their car on the
    pretext of asking for directions, and then they would steal their gold
    jewelry while threatening them with a knife. They confessed to more than
    300 counts of child abduction and gold jewelry theft. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    Mr. Bahadoripur said he had committed these crimes because of financial
    difficulties and that the verdict issued to him was cruel and unjust. He
    said he had not hurt anybody and that his wife new all about the things he
    had done (Hamshahri newspaper). No information is available on other
    aspects of his defense. Judgment Branch 102 of the Esfahan Criminal Court
    sentenced Mr. Behzad Bahadoripur to public execution, 10 years prison, and
    74 lashes, and payment of damages to plaintiffs, for rape and kidnapping.
    This sentence was approved by the Supreme Court. He was hung in public in
    Esfahan, at the intersection of Kaveh Street and Malek Shahr, on July 11,
    2006. The other defendant was sentenced to 10 years prison, 74 lashes, and
    payment of damages to the plaintiffs.
