    News of the execution of Mr. Ehsan M., along with two other individuals,
    was announced by the website of ISNA citing the Public Relations Section
    of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Kerman Province (June 14,
    2006) and the website of IRNA citing an authority in the Public Court of
    Kerman Province (June 15, 2006). The case of Mr. Ehsan M. and the other
    two pertains to abduction, robbery and rape in the city of Kerman during
    February of 2006. Arrest and Detention There is no information available
    on the details of Mr. Ehsan M. s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Ehsan M.
    was tried by the Public Court of Kerman Province. However, there is no
    information available on the session or sessions of Mr. Ehsan M. s trial.
    Charges Mr. Ehsan M., along with two other individuals, was charged with
    multiple counts of abduction, robbery and rape. According to the report by
    the Public Relations Section of the provincial Ministry of Justice office
    of Kerman Province, Mr. Ehsan M. and the other two, disguising themselves
    as taxi drivers, would abduct female students, threaten them with a knife,
    steal their jewelry and sexually abuse them (IRNA). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence entered against Mr. Ehsan M. Defense There is
    no information available on the details of Mr. Ehsan M. s defense.
    Judgment The Public Court of Kerman Province sentenced Mr. Ehsan M. to
    death. The verdict was approved by the Supreme Court. Mr. Ehsan M. was
    publicly hanged along with two other individuals* in the Khaju Square of
    the city of Kerman on Tuesday June 13, 2006. -------------------------
