    News of the execution of Mr. A. J. along with four other individuals was
    announced by the websites of Iscanews (November 17, 2006) and Khabar-e
    Jonoub (November 20, 2006). His case, and that of the other four, was
    related to trafficking illegal drugs. Arrest and detention Mr. A. J. was
    arrested for trafficking narcotics. However, there is no further
    information available on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial
    Mr. A. J. went on trial in Khorasan Province. However, there is no
    information available on the details of the session or sessions of his
    trial. Charges Mr. A. J. and the other four were charged with carrying,
    purchase and sale of narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt Possessing 32.5 kilograms of crystal as well as 87.5 kilograms of
    opium were entered as evidence of guilt against Mr. A. J. Defense There is
    no information available on the details of Mr. A. J. s defense. Judgment
    Mr. A. J. was sentenced to death. He was hanged, along with four other
    individuals, in the presence of the Public Prosecutor, head of the
    provincial Ministry of Justice office, and the prison warden in Taybad
    County s prison on November 16, 2006.
