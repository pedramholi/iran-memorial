    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with another
    defendant, was published by various sources including the Kayhan newspaper
    on May 11, 2006, the Sharq newspaper on May 14, 2006, Fars news agency on
    May 11, 2006, and Khabar-e Jonub on May 15, 2006. According to the
    existing information, this case was related to the rape and murder of a
    12-year-old boy in Khoramabad in April of 2006. According to the Head of
    Courthouse in Lorestan, the case of this person and the other defendant
    was expedited due to special sensitivity and the public hurt feelings, and
    the ruling was issued one month after the crime took place. This person
    was 17 when arrested. (Kayhan) International laws have strictly prohibited
    capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time
    of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Inspectors of the Intelligence
    Police in Khoramabad arrested the defendant on April 10, 2006 during their
    investigation into the disappearance of a 12-year-old boy named Kamran.
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Criminal Court of Khoramabad tried the defendant out of turn. No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges
    brought against this unknown individual were announced as rape and murder.
    According to Fars news agency, the defendant was accused of taking the
    victim to the mountains where, in collaboration with another person, they
    raped and murdered him. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the existing information, the confession of the defendant,
    recovery of the victim s body, and testimony of witnesses, who had seen
    the victim with the defendants, were the basic reasons for the ruling.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense This unknown defendant was 17 years old when the
    incident occurred (Kayhan). No information is available on his defense.
    The legal procedure up to the execution was out of turn and took only one
    month. Judgment The Criminal Court of Khoramabad condemned the defendant
    to death and Branch 32 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling (Kayhan).
    The defendant was hanged, along with the other defendant in this case, in
    public at Naserkhosro Intersection in Khoramabad on May 13, 2006 at 9 a.m.
