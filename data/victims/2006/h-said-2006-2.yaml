    News of the execution of Mr. Sa id H. was announced by the website of IRNA
    (April 11, 2006) and Golshan daily (April 15, 2006), both citing the
    Deputy Commander of the Police Force of Golestan Province in Social and
    Educational Affairs. Mr. Sa id H. was from Gorgan, and his case pertains
    to moharebeh (armed struggle against the holy state) and efsad-e fel arz
    (sowing corruption on earth). Arrest and detention Mr. Sa id H. was armed
    when arrested (Golshan daily). However, there is no information available
    on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Sa id H. was tried
    by a court in Golestan Province. However, there is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of his trial. Charges
    Mr. Sa id H. was charged with moharebeh (armed struggle against the holy
    state) and efsad-e fel arz (sowing corruption on earth). The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt His confessions, complaints of the
    plaintiffs, possession of firearms, explosives, a dagger, two teargas
    sprays, and having a forged identity card were entered as evidence of
    guilt against Mr. Sa id H. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Sa id H. s defense. Judgment Mr. Sa id H.
    was charged with moharebeh (armed struggle against the holy state) and
    efsad-e fel arz (sowing corruption on earth) and sentenced to death. He
    was publicly hanged in the Shahid Qandehari Square of the city of Gorgan,
    on April 11, 2006.
