    News of the execution of Mr. H. A. was announced by the website of Iranian
    Students News Agency (ISNA) on December 31, 2006, citing the Public
    Relations section of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of
    Hormozgan. Mr. H. A., a welder, was from Kouhdasht in Lorestan Province.
    He migrated to a Bandar Abbas neighborhood after he had found a job there.
    However, his work proved not profitable, as a result of which he was
    reduced to collecting steel waste from the Bandar Abbas industrial
    complexes. Mr. H. A. s case was related to the murder of a 72-year old man
    in Bandar Abbas in February/March 2003. Arrest and detention After the
    occurrence of the murder, Mr. H. A. did not attempt to escape. He was
    arrested by the police force in February/March 2003 and spent three years
    in prison. Trial Mr. H. A. went on trial in Hormozgan Province. However,
    there is no information available on the details of the session or
    sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. H. A. was charged with murder.
    According to the available report, the dispute between him and the victim
    started over who would collect the more profitable steel waste. The
    victim, along with a few other individuals, had injured Mr. H. A. in the
    course of a previous fight. This time, with the intention of avenging
    himself, Mr. H. A. attacked the victim with a knife and fatally stabbed
    him. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences, against their opponents (including political, civil society
    activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each
    year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The defendant s
    confessions were entered as evidence of guilt against Mr. H. A.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense There is no further information available on the
    details of Mr. H. A. s defense. Judgment Mr. H. A. was sentenced to death.
    He was hanged in Bandar Abbas Central Prison on December 28, 2006.
