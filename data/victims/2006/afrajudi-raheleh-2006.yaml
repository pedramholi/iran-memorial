    News of the execution of Ms. Raheleh Afrajudi, along with two other
    individuals, was announced by Javan Daily and Iran Daily (January 21,
    2006). Additional information on the case was obtained from Kayhan Daily
    (July 16, 2003), Ettela at Daily and Hamshahri Daily (September 28, 2004),
    and the website of Jam-e Jam (July 21, 2010). The case of Ms. Afrajudi and
    her husband* pertains to the murder of two individuals, as well as robbery
    in the Hovayzeh Street of Tehran on July 14, 2003. Arrest and Detention
    According to the available information, Ms. Afrajudi and her husband were
    arrested by the agents of Police Station 104 of Abbasabad a few hours
    after the occurrence of a murder on Monday, July 13, 2003. She spent two
    years in prison. However, there is no information available on the details
    of Ms. Afrajudi s arrest and detention. Trial Ms. Afrajudi and her husband
    were tried by Branch 74 of the Public Court of Tehran (Javan daily).
    However, there is no information available on the session or sessions of
    her trial. Charges Ms. Afrajudi was charged with involvement in the murder
    of a mother and her daughter (Hamshahri Daily). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offenses, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence of guilt entered
    against Ms. Afrajudi was the discovery of the dead bodies of a mother and
    daughter, the discovery of a stolen car, and the confessions of the
    defendants. Ms. Afrajudi and her husband confessed that they had known the
    murdered mother and daughter three months prior to the incident, and that
    Ms. Afrajudi s used to work for them (Kayhan Daily). International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    Ms. Afrajudi s husband stated that the murdered person had forced his wife
    to sign a confession for some thefts that she had not committed. In order
    to solve the problem, Ms. Afrajudi s husband had gone to the house of the
    would-be victims to convince and prove to them that there had not been any
    stealing by his wife. He wanted them to agree in writing that there has
    been no theft with which they did not agree and resisted to sign anything
    in writing. However, there is no information available on the details of
    Ms. Afrajudi s defense. Judgment Branch 74 of the Public Court of Tehran
    sentenced Ms. Afrajudi to death. Branch 2 of the Supreme Court approved
    the verdict. Ms. Afrajudi was hanged, along with her husband and another
    individual, in Evin Prison on Wednesday, January 18, 2006.
