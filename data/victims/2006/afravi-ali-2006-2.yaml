    Mr. Afravi was interested in history and social activities. He used to
    cooperate with Juornalists' Club in Ahvaz. Information about Mr. Ali
    Afravi s execution was published in numerous media, including IRNA (March
    2, 2006) and Sharq Newspaper (March 2, 2006.) Mr. Afravi was the first of
    the accused to be executed in connection with the 2005 Ahvaz bombings,
    along with Mr. Mahdi Navaseri. In the following months, these executions
    continued, and dozens of other citizens were put to death. Additional
    information was obtained from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation, with a person close to Mr. Afravi and with another
    individual accused in the case, which has been referred to as the Ahvaz
    bombings case by Iranian authorities, as well as from other news websites
    including, ISNA (March 1, 2006), Radio Farda (March 2, 2006), Ahwazi
    Democratic Popular Front (June 28, 2011), Amnesty International (March 1
    and 2, 2006), Human Rights Watch (June 26, 2006), and the Fars News Agency
    (March 1, 2006). Mr. Afravi was 18 years old, single, and a resident of
    [the city of] Ahvaz. According to a person close to him, he was an
    intelligent young man, interested in studying history and engaging in
    social action. He spoke Arabic, Farsi, and English. He worked with the
    Young Reporters Club in Ahvaz, publishing some of his writings in local
    and national media under the name, The Young People of Ahvaz. For
    instance, in objecting to the process of the destruction of Malek Garden,
    one of the region s historical sites, he had written a letter to UNESCO
    under that same name. In high school he had become a member of the Basij
    for a short time, but soon quit . Mr. Afravi participated in [the Province
    of] Khuzestan s Arab [population s] protests and demonstrations in 2005,
    as well as in Koran and Arabic classes conducted at his father s
    psychological services institute. At the time of his arrest, he was about
    to turn eighteen and was preparing for university entrance exams. Mr.
    Afravi s execution prompted the reaction of human rights institutions.
    Amnesty International protested by issuing bulletins, in which it
    considered the revolutionary court proceedings as unjust and based on
    confessions obtained under duress. The Ahwaz Human Rights Organization and
    the British Ahwazi Friendship Society also protested the execution of Arab
    citizens. Hours after the executions of Mr. Afravi and Mr. Navaseri, a
    bomb exploded on 9th Street in Ahvaz s Kianpars neighborhood, shattering
    windows and causing damage to surrounding buildings, although, according
    to local sources, there were no casualties. Historical Background of the
    Ahvaz Bombing Subsequent to the publication of a letter ascribed to a
    government official concerning systematic modification of the fabric of
    Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab population, demonstrations broke out on
    Friday, April 15, 2005, in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in [the town of]
    Hamidideh. In quashing the demonstrations, security and police forces
    resorted to violence, which led to the death and injury of dozens of
    protestors and resulted in the protests and the unrest spreading to a
    number of other Khuzestan cities, continuing for at least 10 days.* These
    protests were the beginning of a series of incidents, including widespread
    arrests, multiple bombings, and successive executions in Ahvaz. For
    instance, a series of bombings followed on June 12 and October 15, 2005,
    and on January 24 and February 27, 2006, in various regions of Ahvaz,
    Abadan, and Dezful. These bombings were carried out in front of government
    buildings and in public places and left in their wake more than 20 dead
    and dozens injured.** According to government sources, other bombings
    (targeting oil pipelines and non-residential regions around Ahvaz)
    occurred at the end of summer and in the fall of 2005, which did not leave
    any casualties. In response to the Ahvaz bombings, security forces
    arrested dozens of the region s ethnic Arab individuals, charging them
    with participation in the bombings. They were then kept in solitary
    confinement cells, for months, at the Information Ministry s Detention
    Center. People being held were subjected to torture, in order to confess
    having taken part in the bombings. According to the Ahvaz Prosecutor,
    ultimately a total of four cases were opened at the Revolutionary Court,
    Special Branch, and at least 45 individuals were charged. Dozens of these
    individuals were tried in closed sessions and were sentenced to death by
    the Revolutionary Court. At least 19 of these sentences were carried out.
    Dozens of other Arab citizens were given long-term sentences. Government
    officials never accepted that these bombings had internal reasons which
    had arisen following the Khuzestan incidents. In multiple, and sometimes
    contradictory, statements, political and judicial authorities imputed
    responsibility to groups opposing [the Islamic Republic], including, Those
    loyal to the previous regime and residing in England; F
