    News of the execution of Mr. Hadi Daryakesh Narui, son of Eisa, was
    announced by Islamic Republic daily on November 2, 2006. His case pertains
    to abduction, shooting, creating fear and trepidation, and injuring the
    plaintiffs. Arrest and detention There is no information available on the
    details of Mr. Daryakesh Narui s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Daryakesh
    Narui was tried by the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Zahedan. However,
    there is no information available on the details of the session or
    sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Daryakesh Narui was charged with
    abduction, shooting, creating fear and trepidation, and injuring the
    plaintiffs. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt Injuring the
    plaintiffs was entered as evidence of guilt against Mr. Daryakesh Narui.
    Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr. Daryakesh
    Narui s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Zahedan
    designated Mr. Hadi Daryakesh Narui as Mohareb (Waging war against God)
    and Mofsed-e fel-Arz (corruptor on earth) and sentenced him to death. The
    verdict was validated by high-echelon judiciary authorities. Mr. Daryakesh
    Narui was publicly hanged, along with another individual, in Zahedan on
    Wednesday, November 1, 2006.
