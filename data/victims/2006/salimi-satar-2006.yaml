    The officials claimed he drowned in the Aras River while trying to escape,
    a story his family rejected. Information regarding the arbitrary execution
    of Mr. Satar Salimi, from Tabriz, was obtained from the Milli Shura
    website (February 9, 2008) and Akhbar-e Rooz (February 10, 2008). Mr.
    Salimi was born in Tabriz in 1988. He attended Akbariyeh Technical High
    School in the Saman-Meydani neighborhood of Tabriz and came from a
    low-income family. (Akhbar-e Rooz, February 10, 2008). In 2005, he became
    familiar with the Azerbaijan National Movement and took an interest in
    learning Azerbaijani Turkish language and literature. He attended informal
    classes for his native language instruction. (Milli Shura, February 9,
    2008) The arbitrary execution of Mr. Salimi happened during the protests
    that erupted after a caricature was published in Iran newspaper in 2006.
    Background of the 2006 Azerbaijan Protests On May 12, 2006, the state-run
    Iran newspaper published a cartoon in its Friday edition. In the cartoon,
    a cockroach responds to a child speaking to it in Azerbaijani with the
    question, "Nemanə?" (meaning "What?"). Many Azerbaijani readers
    interpreted the cartoon as equating the Azeri people with cockroaches,
    viewing it as an explicit insult to the Azerbaijani community in Iran. The
    authorities' longstanding refusal to allow education in mother tongues in
    schools had already created tensions among Azerbaijanis. News of the
    cartoon s publication, coupled with the lack of an official response to
    initial protests mainly organized in universities sparked a wave of street
    demonstrations beginning in late May 2006. In Tabriz, Urmia, Ardabil,
    Zanjan, Marand, Maragheh, Ahar, Khalkhal, Khoy, Miyaneh, and Solduz
    (Naqadeh), protesters chanted slogans such as "Haray, haray, men Turkam"
    ("Cry out, cry out, I am a Turk"), demanding the suspension of Iran
    newspaper and a formal apology from high-ranking officials. As the
    protests escalated on May 23, 2006, the government officially condemned
    the cartoon as an "insult to Iranians." The judiciary ordered the
    suspension of Iran newspaper and the arrest of its editor and cartoonist.
    A motion to impeach the Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance was
    raised in Parliament. Though these measures were intended to quell the
    unrest, they failed to calm public anger. On May 24, 2006, as
    demonstrations intensified in Tabriz, then-President Mahmud Ahmadinejad
    accused the United States of plotting to incite ethnic division. The
    judiciary and police in East Azerbaijan announced the arrest of more than
    50 individuals in connection with the protests. Iranian officials
    continued to attribute the protests to foreign interference and warned of
    harsh measures against demonstrators in Azerbaijan. The following day, in
    the city of Naqadeh (West Azerbaijan Province), police and Basij forces
    opened fire on protesters marching toward the governor s office. In
    response to this violent crackdown, thousands of demonstrators in Tabriz
    threw stones at government buildings and banks. Riot police across various
    cities used tear gas, batons, and, in some cases, live ammunition against
    the crowds. According to Azerbaijani activists and Amnesty International,
    at least 20 people were killed and dozens more were injured during the
    protests. However, Brigadier General Hassan Karami, the then-commander of
    the West Azerbaijan police, reported a lower toll of four dead and 43
    injured. On May 28, 2006, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described
    the demonstrators as agents of "the enemy" and declared: "The enemies do
    not know Azerbaijan; Azerbaijan belongs to the Islamic Revolution." Other
    officials echoed this sentiment in the days that followed. On May 29, the
    Minister of the Interior accused the United States of fueling the unrest.
    The government spokesperson blamed the protests on individuals and groups
    incited by satellite channels. The head of the East Azerbaijan Judiciary
    announced the arrest of 330 people in connection with the protests. It
    accused some of belonging to the "Baha'i faith, the "Tudeh Party," or
    having "links with Israel." In the following months, many detainees were
    prosecuted on charges such as "acting against national security,"
    "propaganda for separatism," and "ethnic incitement." Nearly two years
    later, in September 2008, the Urmia Military Prosecutor s Office ruled on
    the complaints brought by the families of the Naqadeh victims against
    police and Basij forces. It issued a non-prosecution order, declaring the
    use of firearms to have been in accordance with the law, and held the
    state responsible only for paying diyah (blood money) to the families. A
    separate lawsuit against the governor of Naqadeh at the time was dismissed
    by the Tehran Public Employees Court, which acquitted him. However,
    pressure on the victims families and restrictions on holding public
    memorials continued for years. Arrest and Detention Mr. Satar Salimi was
    detained during protests in Tabriz in June 2006. Security forces
