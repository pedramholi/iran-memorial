    News of the execution of Mr. Abbas (Ali) N., along with another person,
    was published on the websites of the Mardomsalari newspaper on June 1,
    2006, the Hambastegi newspaper and Fars news agency on June 7, 2006.
    Additional information was taken from the Iran newspaper on September 24,
    2005, the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper and the website of Khabare Jonub on
    February 16, 2006, and an Amnesty International list. Mr. Abbas (Ali) N. s
    case and the cases of two other defendants was related to the kidnapping
    and rape of an 18-year-old girl at an incomplete building in Karaj on
    September 19, 2005. According to the Amnesty International list, he and
    another defendant of this case were younger than 18 years old at the time
    of the incident. International laws have strictly prohibited capital
    punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr. Abbas (Ali) N. was arrested by
    the Intelligence Police in Karaj, along with another person, on September
    21, 2005 (Fars news agency). They were identified and arrested after a
    complaint was filed by a girl who was raped on September 19, 2005. The
    third defendant was also arrested after the confession of these two
    defendants (Iran newspaper). The circumstances of his arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial Branch 77 of the Criminal Court in Tehran tried Mr.
    Abbas (Ali) N. and the other two defendants in September of 2005. The
    trial was in several sessions with five judges (Mardomsalari newspaper).
    However, no information is available on his trial. Charges According to
    the Head of the Criminal Court in Tehran, the charges brought against Mr.
    Abbas (Ali) N. and another defendant were collectively announced as
    kidnapping, robbery, and rape. (Hambastegi newspaper) The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Abbas (Ali) N. was the complaint and testimony of the young girl, the
    license number of the car belonging to defendants, and their confessions.
    (Mardomsalari newspaper) International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense According to the Amnesty
    International report, Mr. Abbas (Ali) N. was younger than 18 when the
    incident occurred. In an interview with the media, the Head of the
    Criminal Court in Tehran emphasized that the age of Mr. Abbas (Ali) N. and
    another defendant was 18 years old (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on February
    16, 2006). The Deputy Public Prosecutor of Tehran announced their age over
    18 several months later in June of 2006. (Fars news agency) According to
    the judge of this case, Mr. Abbas (Ali) N. and another defendant did not
    accept their charges during the trial and claimed that they had been
    friends with the young girl. The third defendant and the driver of the car
    used for kidnapping, told the court that he was not aware of kidnapping
    and thought that they were friends. (Iran newspaper) Judgment Branch 77 of
    the Criminal Court in Tehran condemned Mr. Abbas (Ali) N. to death on
    September 27, 2005. Branch 39 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling on
    February 13, 2006. After the defendants objected the ruling again, the
    case was referred to The Supreme Court [Case] Evaluation Branch and was
    confirmed again. He was hanged, along with another defendant of the case,
    at the Evin Prison yard in Tehran on May 31, 2006. The third defendant was
    exonerated.
