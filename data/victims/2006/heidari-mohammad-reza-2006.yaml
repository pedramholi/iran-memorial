    The trial was finished before the lawyer could present his statement of
    defense News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Heidari and three other
    people was published by Entekhab Newspaper (November 09, 2006) and the
    Khabar-e Jonub Website (November 11, 2006). Additional information has
    been taken from Shargh Newspaper (May 13 14, 2006, quoting from the head
    of the Public Relations Department of the Tehran Province Prosecutor s
    Office on May 22, 2004 and May 01, 2005), Iranian Students News Agency
    (ISNA, July 21, 2004), Jomhuri-ye Islami Newspaper (July 22, 2004), Iran
    Newspaper (July 31, 2004 and May 01, 2005), and Khabar-e Jonub Website
    (September 04, 2006). At the time of the incident, Mr. Heidari was 21
    years old. He had gone from Shiraz to Tehran in pursuit of work. His file
    has to do with a murder in a jewelry store and the holding hostage of four
    women in a literacy class at Salman Farsi Boys School on Tuesday May 11,
    2004. Arrest and detention Mr. Heidari was arrested on Tuesday May 11,
    2004 at the Salman Farsi Boys School on Shahid Madani (Nezam Abad) Street.
    The arresting officers were from Namjoo Precinct 106 and Misagh Precinct
    11 of the Tehran Police. After the murder, Heidari came out of the jewelry
    store and was surrounded by a crowd who had heard the gunshots.
    Frightened, he ran into a school. The school only had one door, so he
    couldn t get away. There were four women there waiting for their teacher.
    He took them hostage, but after four hours, he gave his gun to the police
    and surrendered (ISNA). Trial Branch 74 of the Criminal Court of Tehran
    Province tried Mr. Heidari on July 10, 2004. The trial was concluded in
    one session, with one chief judge and four assistant judges. He had a
    lawyer. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Heidari was intentional
    homicide and inciting terror, fear, and intimidation . The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence against Mr. Heidari
    included confession of the accused, the forensic medical examiner s
    report, possession of a gun, holding four hostages, and testimony of
    witnesses. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Heidari defended himself in
    court. He said, I did not intend to kill the victim. I just wanted my
    money back. First I threatened him, but he would not agree. I shot him in
    the side and tried to leave the store. He stopped me, so I shot him in the
    head. I did not even threaten the people whom they say I took hostage. He
    did not admit to theft or hostage taking (ISNA). He did not accept the
    opinions of the forensic medical examiner indicating intentional homicide
    . His lawyer stated that he would present a separate defense dealing with
    attempted robbery and hostage taking. However, the trial ended after one
    session. When he was arrested, Heidari had taken the hostages out of fear.
    One of the hostages testified that from the beginning, he had not intended
    to harm any of them. He even freed one of the women as soon as he realized
    she was pregnant (Shargh Newspaper May 12, 2004) Judgment Branch 74 of the
    Criminal Court of Tehran Province sentenced Mr. Heidari to execution for
    committing murder and 74 lashes for inciting terror, fear, and
    intimidation. This sentence was approved by the Supreme Court and the Head
    of the Judiciary. The lashing was carried out on May 01, 2005 at the
    sentence implementation branch of the Tehran District Attorney s Office.
    Mr. Heidari and three other people were executed by hanging in Evin Prison
    on November 09, 2006.
