    News of the execution of Mr. Naser Batmani was published on the websites
    of the Human Rights Organization of Kurdistan and Iran Press News on
    January 1, 2007, quoting the same organization. He was 22 years old and
    from Kamyaran in Kurdistan. His case was related to the murder of an
    individual. Mr. Batmani was 17 years old at the time of the incident.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention
    on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. In a
    detailed report regarding the execution of children and youth in Iran,
    Amnesty International objected to the execution of Mr. Batmani. (January
    2, 2008) Arrest and detention After his arrest, Mr. Batmani was detained
    for five years. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Batmani s trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Batmani was announced as murder. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Batmani. Defense Mr. Batmani was younger than 18 when the crime took
    place. No information is available on his defense. Judgment Mr. Naser
    Batmani was hanged in Sanandaj Prison in December of 2006. There is no
    information on the verdict leading to this execution.
