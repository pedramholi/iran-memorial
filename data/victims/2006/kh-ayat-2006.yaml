    News of the execution of Mr. Ayat Kh. along with another individual, was
    announced by the websites of Khabar-e Jonoub (February 15, 2006) citing
    the Public Relations section of the office of the Public and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor of Fars Province, and the website of ISNA (February 17, 2006)
    citing the Public Relations section of the provincial Ministry of Justice
    office in Fars Province. Mr. Ayat Kh. s case pertains to a murder. Arrest
    and Detention There is no information available on the details of Mr. Ayat
    Kh. s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Ayat Kh. was tried by Branch Twelve
    of the Court of Shiraz. However, there is no information available on the

    charged with premeditated murder. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    There is no information available on the details of the evidence entered
    against Mr. Ayat Kh. Defense There is no information available on the
    details of Mr. Ayat Kh. s defense. Judgment Branch Twelve of the Court of

    37 of the Supreme Court as well as the head of the Judiciary. Mr. Ayat Kh.
    was hanged in the Adelabad Prison of Shiraz on February 15, 2006.
