    Law enforcement officials fatally shot Mr. Baruni Haqiqat in the head
    during their operation at the Deylam Port Customs compound. Information
    regarding the arbitrary execution of Mr. Baruni Haqiqat has been obtained
    from Fars News Agency (November 5, 2006), the Iranian Labour News Agency
    (ILNA) (November 5, 2006), and the International Alliance in Support of
    Workers in Iran (November 5, 2006). Little is known about Mr. Haqiqat's
    life, except that he worked as a driver at the Deylam Port Customs
    facility. Event background On April 2, 2006, a group of workers and
    drivers employed at the customs office of Deylam Port in Bushehr Province
    held a peaceful protest to object to harsh working conditions, low wages,
    and the local authorities failure to address their labor-related
    grievances. At the same time, law enforcement forces entered the customs
    area under the pretext of combating smuggling and opened direct fire on
    the workers, resulting in the death of a worker identified as Barani
    Haghighat and the injury of several others. The incident quickly triggered
    public unrest and anger in the city and prompted a wave of criticism from
    members of Parliament and labor organizations. On November 5, 2006, the
    workers representative of Bushehr Province stated that the protest had
    taken place within the customs premises and had no connection whatsoever
    to smuggling or other illegal activities. He emphasized that the victims
    of this incident were local workers, and any allegation of smuggling is
    entirely unfounded. Mr. Baruni Haqiqat s arbitrary execution According to
    available information, Mr. Baruni Haqiqat was a driver who worked at the
    Deylam Port Customs facility. On April 2, 2006, he was fatally shot by law
    enforcement officials and died instantly from a gunshot wound to the head.
    On that same day, law enforcement opened fire on workers and drivers
    staging a protest inside the Deylam Port Customs compound. Mr. Haqiqat was
    killed instantly by a gunshot to the head during this shooting, and
    another worker, named Abdolhossein Khajeh, was injured. The workers
    representative in Bushehr Province stated that "the issue of smuggling is
    entirely baseless," noting that the victims were local workers. (Nabard-e
    Khalq, November 5, 2006; ILNA, November 5, 2006). A group of political
    prisoners issued a joint statement condemning the incident as a "crackdown
    on laborers" and urged human rights organizations and the International
    Labour Organization to support Iranian workers in protecting their legal
    rights (International Alliance in Support of Workers in Iran, November 8,
    2006). Regulations on Controlling Protests There have been numerous
    reports of deaths during critical demonstrations in Iran. In many of these
    cases, armed forces have used firearms to suppress protests. Iranian law
    provides certain regulations regarding the use of firearms by armed forces
    during demonstrations. In addition, there are legal provisions in Iran for
    the punishment of officials who act unlawfully by firing weapons, as well
    as rules for the compensation of victims. This brief overview will review
    these provisions. The law allows armed forces officials to use firearms in
    certain situations, including to prevent riots and disorders. However, the
    law does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes riots and
    disorders. The Law on the Use of Firearms by the Armed Forces in Essential
    Cases, enacted in 1994, outlines specific conditions for the use of
    firearms. The main principle established by this law is that of necessity,
    meaning that armed forces officers may fire their weapons only in
    emergencies. Regarding protests, Articles 4 and 5 of this law allow
    officials to use their weapons under certain conditions to restore order
    and prevent riots. Article 4 states: "Police officers are authorized to
    use firearms to restore order and control illegal demonstrations, suppress
    riots and disorders that cannot be controlled without the use of weapons,
    upon the order of the commander of the operation, if the following
    conditions are met:". a) Other measures must have been tried first and
    proven ineffective. b) There must be a final warning to the rioters and
    insurgents before the use of firearms. Note 1: The determination of riots
    under Article 4 is the responsibility of the heads of the provincial and
    district security councils. In their absence, it is the responsibility of
    their deputies. If the governor has no political deputy, this
    responsibility is assigned to a member of the Security Council. Note 2: In
    cases where armed forces are assigned the task of restoring order and
    security under this article, they are also subject to the provisions of
    this article regarding the use of firearms. This article clearly states
    that armed personnel must first use non-lethal methods and only resort to
    firearms if those methods fail to control the situation. They must also
    warn the demonstrators. The law does not specify what other non-lethal
    methods should be used, bu
