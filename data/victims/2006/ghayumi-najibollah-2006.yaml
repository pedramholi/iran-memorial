    News of the execution of Mr. Najibollah Ghayumi, son of Besmellah, along
    with another individual was announced by Kayhan daily (November 6-7, 2006)
    and the website of Khabar-e Jonoub (November 8, 2006), both citing the
    Public Relations section of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of
    Sistan and Baluchistan. Mr. Ghayumi s case pertains to trafficking illegal
    drugs. Arrest and detention There is no information available on the
    details of Mr. Ghayumi s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Ghayumi was tried
    by the Public and Islamic Revolutionary courts of Iranshahr. However,
    there is no information available on the details of the session or
    sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Ghayumi was charged with trafficking
    heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on the details of the evidence of guilt
    entered against Mr. Ghayumi. Defense There is no information available on
    the details of Mr. Ghayumi s defense. Judgment The Public and Islamic
    Revolutionary courts of Iranshahr sentenced Mr. Najibollah Ghayumi to
    death. The verdict was validated by high-echelon judiciary authorities.
    Mr. Ghayumi was publicly hanged, along with another individual, in Zahedan
    on November 5, 2006.
