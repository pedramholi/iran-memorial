    News of the execution of an unknown individual was announced by the Naseer
    Weekly of Bushehr on May 13, 2006. This unknown individual s case pertains
    to a murder in the County of Bushehr in 2004. Arrest and Detention There
    is no information available on the details of this unknown individual s
    arrest and detention. Trial This unknown individual was tried in the
    County of Bushehr. However, there is no information available on the
    details of the session or sessions of this unknown individual s trial.
    Charges This unknown individual was charged with murder. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence of guilt entered against this unknown
    individual. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense There is no information
    available on the details of this unknown individual s defense. Judgment
    This unknown individual was sentenced to death. He was hanged in the
    County of Bushehr some time during the May of 2006. However, there is no
    further information available on the details of this verdict.
