    News of the execution of Mr. Yusef Hassanzehi, son of Lalmohammad, along
    with another person, was published on the website of ISNA (Iranian
    Students News Agency) on December 25, 2006 and in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on December 28, 2006, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Sistan va Baluchistan Courthouse. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Hassanzehi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch One
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Zahedan tried Mr. Hassanzehi. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against
    Mr. Hassanzehi were announced as participation in 11 armed kidnappings,
    intimidation and public disturbance, and armed road blocking. (Public
    Relations Office of the Sistan va Baluchistan Courthouse) The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Hassanzehi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hassanzehi s
    defense. Judgment Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Zahedan
    condemned Mr. Yusef Hassanzehi to death and the Supreme Court confirmed
    the ruling. He was hanged, along with another person, in public at the
    intersection of Janbazan and Behdasht Boulevards in Zahedan, in December
    of 2006.
