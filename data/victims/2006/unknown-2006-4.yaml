    News of the execution of an unknown individual was announced by the
    websites of ISNA (February 24, 2006) and Javan daily (March 6, 2006), both
    citing the Public Relations section of the provincial Ministry of Justice
    office of Ardabil Province. This unknown individual was 20, a bachelor and
    was from Meshkinshahr. The case of this unknown individual pertains to the
    murder of an 18-year old man in one of the villages near Meshkinshahr in
    2003 Arrest and Detention There is no information available on the details
    of this unknown individual s arrest and detention. Trial This unknown
    individual was tried by the Public Court of Ardabil Province. However,
    there is no information available on the details of the session or
    sessions of his/her trial. Charges This unknown individual was charged
    with murder. He was accused of stabbing an 18-year old man to death
    (ISNA). The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no
    information available on the details of the evidence entered against this
    individual. Defense There is no information available on the details of
    this unknown individual s defense. Judgment The Public Court of Ardabil
    Province sentenced this unknown individual to death. The verdict was
    approved by the Supreme Court. This unknown individual was hanged in
    Ardabil Prison on February 20, 2006.
