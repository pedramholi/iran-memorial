    citing the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Fars Province on April
    8, 2006. The case of Mr. Ali B. pertains to the murder of his wife. Arrest
    and detention There is no information available on the details of Mr. Ali

    Public Court of Shiraz. However, there is no information available on the

    B. was charged with murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on the details of the evidence of guilt
    entered against Mr. Ali B. Defense There is no information available on

    Court of Shiraz sentenced Mr. Ali B. to death. The verdict was validated
    by the Supreme Court. Mr. Ali B. was hanged in the courtyard of Shiraz s
    Adelabad Prison on April 8, 2006.
