    News of the execution of Mr. Said A., along with another individual, was
    announced by the websites of Khabar-e Jonub and Donya-ye Eqtesad (August
    19, 2006). He was from Ruyan (formerly Alamdeh) and his case was related
    to sexual offenses. Arrest and Detention There is no information available
    on the details of Mr. Said A. s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Said A.
    was tried by a court in Mazandaran Province. However, there is no
    information available on the session or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr.
    Said A. was charged with non-marital sex. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr. Said A. Defense
    There is no information available on the details of Mr. Said A. s defense.

    along with another individual in the courtyard of Sari Prison on Thursday,
    August 17, 2006. Mr. Said A. s dead body was delivered to his family for
    burial after the execution had been carried out.
