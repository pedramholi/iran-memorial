    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan Qanbari along with another individual,
    was announced by the website of IRNA citing the Deputy Public Prosecutor
    of Qom (January 25, 2004). Additional information on this case was
    obtained from the website of the Chief Public Prosecutor (January 24,
    2004). The case of Mr. Qanbari and three other individuals pertains to
    drug trafficking. Arrest and Detention Mr. Qanbari was arrested well
    before the carrying out of the sentence (IRNA). However, there is no
    information available on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial
    Mr. Qanbari and the three other individuals implicated in this case were
    tried by Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qom. However,
    there is no information available on the session or sessions of his trial.
    Charges Mr. Qanbari and another individual were charged with carrying the
    illegal drugs of opium, heroin, and hashish by the Deputy Public
    Prosecutor of Qom. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The evidence entered against Mr. Qanbari and another individual was
    possessing one ton of opium, 49 kilograms of heroin, and 28 kilograms of
    hashish. Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr.
    Qanbari s defense. Judgment Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    sentenced Mr. Hassan Qanbari to death. He was publicly hanged on
    Wednesday, January 25, 2005 in the Qaem-Shahr area of the city of Qom. On
    the same day, the primary defendant of the case* was also publicly hanged
    in the Nirougah area of the city of Qom. The third defendant of the case
    was exonerated from execution, but there is no information available on
    his final verdict. The fourth defendant of the case was released.
