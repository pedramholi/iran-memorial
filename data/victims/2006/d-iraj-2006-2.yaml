    News of the execution of Mr. Iraj D., son of Qasem, was announced by Iran
    daily and Islamic Republic daily on March 7, 2005, both citing the Public
    Relations and Communications section of the provincial Ministry of Justice
    office of Khuzestan. Mr. Iraj D. s case pertains to the murder of a person
    in the Sherafat Village of Shushtar. Arrest and detention There is no
    information available on the details of Mr. Iraj D. s arrest and
    detention. Trial Mr. Iraj D. was tried by Branch One of the Public Court
    of Gotvand City, in Khuzestan Province. However, there is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of Mr. Iraj D. s

    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr. Iraj D. Defense
    There is no information available on the details of Mr. Iraj D. s defense.

    to death. The verdict was validated by Branch 39 of the Supreme Court. Mr.
    Iraj D. was publicly hanged in Shushtar Counnty on March 6, 2005.
