    News of the execution of Mr. Gholam Reza Shahriari, son of Hossein, along
    with two others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on February 24,
    2000. According to the Drug Control Headquarters report, his case and
    those of the other two defendants were related to the identification and
    arrest of several drug trafficking gangs in the Mazandaran province.
    Arrest and detention The Mazandaran Police arrested Mr. Shahriari. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Shahriari. No information is available on
    his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Shahriari was announced
    as dealing of narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Shahriari was possession of 510
    kilograms of heroin. Defense No information is available on Mr. Shahriari
    s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court condemned Mr. Gholam
    Reza Shahriari to death. The Supreme Court and the General Public
    Prosecutor confirmed the ruling and he was hanged, along with two others,
    in Mazandaran in 2000. No specific information is available about this
    execution.
