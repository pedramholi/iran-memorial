    News of the execution of Mr. Dariush Ja fari, along with three others, was
    published in the Kayhan newspaper on March 4, 2000. According to the
    Public Relations Office of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Lorestan,
    Mr. Ja fari s case was related, along with three other defendants, to drug
    trafficking. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Ja fari s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch Two of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Khoramabad tried Mr. Ja fari. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Ja fari and
    the other three defendants was announced as widespread distribution of
    narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Ja fari. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ja fari s defense. Judgment Branch Two of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Khoramabad condemned Mr. Ali Hossein Ja fari to
    death. The General Public Prosecutor confirmed the ruling and he was
    hanged, along with three others, at the Training Center of Parsilun Prison
    in Khoramabad in 2000.
