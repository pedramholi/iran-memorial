    News of the execution of Mr. Seifollah Parvandeh was published in the
    archive of Imam Ali Digital Library, quoting the Kayhan newspaper on
    September 9, 2000. Mr. Parvandeh s case was related, along with four other
    defendants, to armed robberies from large trucks on the southern roads
    between 1990 and 1995. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Parvandeh s arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Andimeshk
    Courthouse tried Mr. Parvandeh and the other four defendants. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against
    Mr. Parvandeh were announced as four armed robberies, murdering a person,
    and participation in three other murders. According to the Kayhan
    newspaper report, he and the other four defendants took heavy trucks to
    secondary and quiet roads, murdered the drivers, and then sold the trucks
    and their contents. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Parvandeh. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Parvandeh s defense. Judgment The Andimeshk Courthouse
    condemned Mr. Seifollah Parvandeh to death and 12 years imprisonment. The
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and he was hanged in public at the
    Basij Square in Andimeshk on September 7, 2000. The other defendants were
    condemned to death, long term imprisonment, exile, and lashes based on
    their alleged charges; however, no specific information is available about
    these rulings.
