    News of the execution of Mr. Shahram Azizi was published in the Kayhan
    newspaper March 11, 2000. Mr. Azizi was married and a student at the
    Career Technical College. His case was related to the murder of his wife
    in 1998. According to the Head of Ramsar Courthouse, the motive in this
    murder was a family dispute. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Azizi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Azizi s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr.
    Azizi was announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Azizi. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Azizi s defense. Judgment Mr. Shahram Azizi was hanged in Ramsar in
    2000. No specific information is available about this execution.
