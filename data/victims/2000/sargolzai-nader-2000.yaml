    News of the execution of Mr. Nader Sargolza i, son of Hossein, along with
    two others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on February 24, 2000.
    According to the Drug Control Headquarters report, his case and those of
    the other two defendants were related to the identification and arrest of
    several drug trafficking gangs in the Mazandaran province. He was a Zabol
    resident. Arrest and detention The Mazandaran Police arrested Mr. Sargolza
    i. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial The
    Islamic Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Sargolza i. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Sargolza i
    was announced as participation in armed trafficking of narcotics. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Sargolza i was possession of 90 kilograms of opium on one
    occasion and 1,400 kilograms of opium on another occasion. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Sargolza i s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court condemned Mr. Nader Sargolza i to death. The Supreme
    Court and the General Public Prosecutor confirmed the ruling and he was
    hanged, along with two others, in Mazandaran in 2000. No specific
    information is available about this execution.
