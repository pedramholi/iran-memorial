    News of the execution of Mr. Mojtaba Zebar, known as Zebardast, along with
    five others, was published in the Jomhuri-Eslami newspaper on July 11,
    2000. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on Mr. Zebar s
    arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on Mr. Zebar s
    trial. According to the report, the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    investigated the case against these defendants. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Zebar were announced as "dealing 5 kilograms of heroin known
    as Ashk; dealing and transporting 204 kilograms of morphine in Tehran,
    Orumieh, Iranshahr, and Yazd; dealing 616 kilograms of opium in Tehran,
    Orumieh, and Yazd; dealing 7 kilograms of heroin and 10 kilograms of
    hashish in one occasion; continuous activity in trafficking narcotics; and
    dealing and distributing heroin and morphine across the country in
    multiple occasions." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Zebar. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Zebar's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mojtaba
    Zebar to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was
    executed on July 8, 2000. No specific information is available about the
    location of this execution.
