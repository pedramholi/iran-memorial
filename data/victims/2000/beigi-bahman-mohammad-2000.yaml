    News of the execution of Mr. Bahman Mohammad Biegi, along with three
    others, was published in the Iran newspaper on January 20, 2000. Mr.
    Mohammad Biegi was 40 years old and a resident of a city in Zanjan
    province. His case was related to the murder of a 55-year-old woman at her
    house in Sa adatabad in Tehran on June 10, 1996. Arrest and detention The
    police detectives arrested Mr. Mohammad Biegi at his residence near Zanjan
    and transferred him to Tehran in June of 1991. His arrest was related to
    clues found about the murder of his mother-in-law at her house in Sa
    adatabad in Tehran. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial The Criminal Court of Tehran tried Mr. Mohammad Biegi. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Mohammad Biegi was announced as murder. He was charged with the murder
    of his mother-in-law over a dispute, and escaping the scene. No detailed
    information is available on his charges. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Mohammad Biegi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohammad Biegi
    s defense. Judgment The Criminal Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Bahman
    Mohammad Biegi to death. He was hanged, along with three others, in Qasr
    Prison on January 19, 2000 at dawn. No specific information is available
    about this execution.
