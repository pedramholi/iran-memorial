    News of the execution of Mr. Ebadollah Rasuli, son of Almas, was published
    in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on November 26, 2000, quoting the
    Informational and Social Deputy of Judiciary. His case was related to a
    murder in March of 2000. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Rasuli s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Rasuli s trial. Charges According to the Informational
    and Social Deputy of Judiciary, the charge brought against Mr. Rasuli was
    announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Rasuli. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Rasuli s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ebadollah Rasuli
    to death. After legal procedure concluded and with the permission by the
    Head of Judiciary, the ruling was carried out when he was hanged at the
    Ilam Central Prison in 2000.
