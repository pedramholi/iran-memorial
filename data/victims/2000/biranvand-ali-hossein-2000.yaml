    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Hossein Biranvand, known as Reza Garichi,
    along with three others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on March 4,
    2000. According to the Public Relations Office of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Lorestan, Mr. Biranvand s case was related, along
    with three other defendants, to drug trafficking. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Biranvand s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Khoramabad tried Mr.
    Biranvand. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Biranvand and the other three defendants was announced
    as widespread distribution of narcotics. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Biranvand.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Biranvand s defense. Judgment
    Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Khoramabad condemned Mr.
    Ali Hossein Biranvand to death. The General Public Prosecutor confirmed
    the ruling and he was hanged, along with three others, at the Training
    Center of Parsilun Prison in Khoramabad in 2000.
