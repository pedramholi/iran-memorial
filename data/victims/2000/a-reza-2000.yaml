circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Reza A. was published in the Kayhan newspaper
    on January 15, 2000. His case was related to the harassment of a
    16-year-old. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Reza A. s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Reza A. s trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Reza A. were
    announced as torture, physical and psychological harassment, and acts
    incompatible with chastity. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Reza A. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Reza A. s defense. Judgment Mr. Reza A. was condemned to death. He
    was hanged at the Mashhad Central Prison on January 12, 2000.
