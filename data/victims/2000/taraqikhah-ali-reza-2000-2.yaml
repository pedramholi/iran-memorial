    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Reza Taraqikhah, along with three others,
    was published in the Iran newspaper on January 20, 2000. His case was
    related to the murder of a 24-year-old man in Tehran during a fight on
    June 7, 1998. Arrest and detention Mr. Taraqikhah was arrested in June of
    1998 following the murder of a man. The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch 1608 of the Criminal Court of Tehran
    tried Mr. Taraqikhah. No information is available on his trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Taraqikhah was announced as murder. He was
    charged with the murder of a neighbor by blows of a knife on June 7, 1998.
    According to the report, after he had a fight with his wife, neighbors
    gathered in front of his house and he attempted to disperse them. No
    detailed information is available on his charges. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Taraqikhah. Defense No information is available on Mr. Taraqikhah s
    defense. According to the report, he was very angry during the fight with
    his wife, and when neighbors gathered, he committed the murder because of
    his extreme anger and agitation. Judgment Branch 1608 of the Criminal
    Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Ali Reza Taraqikhah to death. He was hanged,
    along with three others, in Qasr Prison on January 19, 2000 at dawn. No
    specific information is available about this execution.
