    News of the execution of Mr. Kurosh Nasir Moqadam, along with three
    others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on March 4, 2000. According
    to the Public Relations Office of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Lorestan, Mr. Nasir Moqaddam s case was related, along with three other
    defendants, to drug trafficking. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    Mr. Nasir Moqadam s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch Two
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Khoramabad tried Mr. Nasir Moqadam.
    No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought
    against Mr. Nasir Moqadam and the other three defendants was announced as
    widespread distribution of narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Nasir Moqadam. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Nasir Moqadam s defense. Judgment
    Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Khoramabad condemned Mr.
    Kurosh Nasir Moqadam to death. The General Public Prosecutor confirmed the
    ruling and he was hanged, along with three others, at the Training Center
    of Parsilun Prison in Khoramabad in 2000
