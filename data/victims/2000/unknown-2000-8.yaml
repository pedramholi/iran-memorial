    News of the execution of an unknown person was based on the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation s research, quoting statistics announced by the
    Security Deputy of the Interior Ministry published in the Iran newspaper
    on June 30, 2001. This case was related to narcotics. According to the
    Security Deputy of the Interior Ministry, a total of 15,869 individuals
    had been arrested in relation to narcotics between March 21, 1999 and
    March 20, 2000 among whom a total of 1,735 individuals had been condemned
    to death. The death sentences against 400 individuals were confirmed and,
    ultimately, a total of 233 individuals were executed. (Iran newspaper) *
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges The charge brought against the defendant was
    announced as crimes related to narcotics. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment
    This individual was executed between March 21, 1999 and March 20, 2000.
    However, no specific information is available about the defendant s
    execution. * The Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation had gathered the
    identity of 55 individuals executed for narcotics related charges between
    March 21, 1999 and March 20, 2000. Based on the newspaper report, another
    178 unknown individuals would have been executed during this period.
