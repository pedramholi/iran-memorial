    News of the execution of Mr. Mazar Qanbarzehi, son of Yarmohammad, along
    with five others, was published in the Jomhuri-Eslami newspaper on July
    11, 2000. Arrest and Detentio n There is no specific information on Mr.
    Qanbarzehi s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Qanbarzehi s trial. According to the report, the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court investigated the case against these defendants. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Qanbarzehi were announced as "dealing 2,596 kilograms of opium
    and 2,546 kilograms of morphine in 6 occasions, continuous activity in
    distribution and trafficking narcotics across the country along with armed
    convoys." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Qanbarzehi. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Qanbarzehi's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mazar
    Qanbarzehi to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He
    was executed on July 8, 2000. No specific information is available about
    the location of this execution.
