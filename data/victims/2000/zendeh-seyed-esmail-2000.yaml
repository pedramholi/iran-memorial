    News of the execution of Mr. Seyed Esma il Zendeh, along with two others,
    was published on the website of Iran Mania on July 24, 2000, quoting the
    Khorasan newspaper. His case and the case of his wife, Aida Shafi i, was
    related to the murder of a couple by gunshots in 1997. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Zendeh s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Zendeh s trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Zendeh and his wife was announced as
    murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence
    presented against Mr. Zendeh was his confession during the police
    interrogation in Tehran. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Zendeh s defense. Judgment Mr. Seyed Esma il Zendeh was hanged, along
    with two others, at a prison in Tehran on July 23, 2000.
