    News of the execution of Mr. Rahim Shahmohammadi was published in the Iran
    newspaper on February 17, 2000. His case was related to the murder of an
    18-year-old man at Punak in Tehran during a street fight in September of
    1997. Arrest and detention The police arrested Mr. Shahmohammadi a few
    days after a murder took place in September of 1997. The circumstances of
    his arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Criminal Court of Tehran
    tried Mr. Shahmohammadi. No information is available on his trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Shahmohammadi was announced as murder. The
    court charged him with the murder of his friend by blows of a knife during
    a street fight at Punak in Tehran in September of 1997. According to the
    existing information, the fight took place over a financial dispute. No
    detailed information is available on his charges. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Shahmohammadi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Shahmohammadi s
    defense. Judgment The Criminal Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Rahim
    Shahmohammadi to death for murder. He was hanged in the presence of the
    victim s family in Qasr Prison on February 16, 2000 at dawn. No specific
    information is available about this execution.
