    News of the execution of Mr. Davud Sanginizak, known as Kianush, along
    with another person, was published in the Hamshahri newspaper on May 12,
    2000, and based on an interview by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation
    with his cellmate (ABF interview) on April 23, 2012. Additional
    information was taken from the Etela at newspaper on September 6, 1999 and
    May 10, 2000. His case and the cases of two others were related to an
    armed robbery, injuring a soldier, and killing of two agents around the
    International Exhibition in Tehran on May 6, 1998. Arrest and Detention
    Mr. Sanginizak and his two friends were arrested by Shahriyar Police in
    Tehran on May 6, 1998. According to the existing information, on this day
    police arrested them based on suspicion. After being transferred to the
    police vehicle, Mr. Sanginizak used his hidden weapon and took the weapon
    of an agent with the help of his friends. They got into a shooting
    confrontation with officials that resulted in injuring a soldier and
    killing two agents ( Etela at newspaper on May 10, 2000). He was
    interrogated in Evin Police Station and was detained in the Youth Section
    for some time. He had visitations. He had been transferred to solitary
    confinement in the Qasr Prison several days before his execution (ABF
    interview). After the arrest of these three individuals, and based on
    their confessions, 30 others were also arrested. Trial Branch 1602 of the
    Criminal Court in Tehran tried Mr. Sanginizak and the other defendants. No
    other information is available on his trial. Charges The charges against
    Mr. Sanginizak were announced as "two counts of murder, destruction of two
    vehicles belonging to the security forces and a passerby, committing armed
    robbery (at least one occasion), committing robberies, providing a corrupt
    environment in a bachelor pad, committing adultery, resisting and shooting
    at police, and dealing and consuming alcoholic beverages. ( Etela at
    newspaper on September 6, 1999) The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt According to the
    Hamshahri newspaper, the evidence presented against Mr. Sanginizak was his
    confession, the confession of his collaborator, and having a criminal
    record. International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned
    the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense During his interrogation, Mr. Sanginizak confessed
    after receiving lashes. The marks of lashes were evident when he was
    detained in the Youth Section of the prison. A cavity could be seen in his
    foot (ABF interview). No information is available on his defense. Judgment
    Branch 1602 of the Criminal Court in Tehran condemned Mr. Davud Sanginizak
    to death two counts for committing two murders, to two years imprisonment
    for destruction of vehicles, to five years imprisonment and 74 lashes for
    an armed robbery, to two years imprisonment and 74 lashes for several
    unarmed robberies, to two years imprisonment for providing a corrupt
    environment in a bachelor pad, 99 lashes for adultery, to three years
    imprisonment for resisting police and shooting at them, to one year
    imprisonment for dealing alcoholic beverages, and to 80 lashes for
    drinking alcoholic beverages. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He
    was hanged, along with another person, at the Qasr Prison yard in Tehran
    on May 11, 2000. The lash ruling against him was carried out before his
    execution. The marks of lashes were so severe that the person in charge of
    washing his body in the mortuary wept. His body was buried in Behesht-e
    Zahra in Tehran.
