    News of the execution of Mr. Nurkhoda Mahmudi, along with three others,
    was published in the Iran newspaper on January 20, 2000. Mr. Mahmudi was
    40 years old. Arrest and detention Mr. Mahmudi was arrested in 1997
    following a complained filed by the family of a person named Mohammd
    Hosseinzadeh, whose body was found in a street in Tehran after being
    missing for several months. The circumstances of his arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Mahmudi s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Mahmudi was announced as murder.
    According to the report, the court charged him with the murder of a farmer
    from Kermanshah. No detailed information is available on his charges. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Mahmudi. According to the report, with an invitation by Mr. Mahmudi the
    victim had travelled to Tehran to resolve his problems. However, no
    explanation is reported about these problems. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mahmudi s defense. He had denied any meeting with the
    victim in Tehran. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Nurkhoda Mahmudi to
    death for murder. He was hanged, along with three others, in Qasr Prison
    on January 19, 2000 at dawn. No specific information is available about
    this execution.
