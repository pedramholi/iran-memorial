    News of the conviction and execution of Mr. Mala (Ala ) Nasrollahi was
    published in the Etela at newspaper on January 6, 1999, and in the
    Hamshahri newspaper on June 15, 2000. Arrest and Detention According to
    the Ettela at newspaper, quoting Mr. Nasrollahi, he was arrested an hour
    after committing the crime and was transferred to the hospital, since he
    had injured himself, too. The circumstances of Mr. Nasrollahi s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch 1601 of the Criminal Special Court,
    Judge Hosseini-Kuhkamari presiding, investigated this case on January 5,
    1999. The victim s mother stated in the court that her seventeen-year-old
    daughter had been engaged with the defendant for three years. She did not
    want to marry him, because of his accusations. However, with the hope of
    better behavior, they got married. His violent behavior and harassments,
    however, increased and, finally, after two months, he killed his wife.
    Charges The charge against Mr. Nasrollahi was announced as murder.
    According to the reports, he had murdered his wife by stabbing her twelve
    times with a knife and injuring himself on August 26, 1998. He had gone to
    a doctor s office, who was his wife s cousin, to bring his wife back home.
    However, when his wife did not want to go with him, he killed her.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided against Mr. Nasrollahi was his
    confessions. He told the court: I accept the charge of murdering my wife.
    I hope the plaintiffs wish comes true as soon as possible. Defense No
    information is available concerning Mr. Nasrollahi's defense. During an
    interview with the reporter of Etela at newspaper, he stated, We were
    relatives. My wife and her cousin would go out without my permission. On
    the day of the incident, I followed my wife and entered the doctor s
    office around 3:00 p.m. At that time, I became angry and stabbed her and
    myself. Then, I left the office. I intended to kill her cousin, too, but I
    changed my mind. I was always following my wife, thinking that she might
    cheat on me. Sometimes I took pictures of her in the streets. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Mala (Ala ) Nasrollahi to death. He was hanged in the
    Qasr prison yard on June 14, 2000. According to the Etela at newspaper,
    the judge told the victim s mother to pay the Diyeh (blood money) in order
    to carry out the ruling. However, the mother, who was financially covered
    by the Emdad [support] Committee, could not afford paying the Diyeh.
    Therefore, she asked the judge to use her daughter s dowry of 100 gold
    coins to pay the Diyeh.
