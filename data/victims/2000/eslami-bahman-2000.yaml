    News of the execution of Mr. Bahman Eslami, known as Kambiz Torkeh, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on November 11, 2000 and the
    Entekhab newspaper on November 8, 2000. Additional information was taken
    from the Entekhab newspaper on October 24, 2000 and the website of
    Lathayetehran. According to the existing information, Mr. Eslami was a
    champion in the Kamp neighborhood near Satarkhan Street in Tehran (website
    of Lathayetehran). He was once arrested for sedition and hooliganism in
    1997. Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court condemned him to
    death. However, this ruling was not confirmed by the Supreme Court and his
    case was returned to the Revolutionary Court for retrial. During the
    second trial, he defended himself and was condemned to 15 years
    imprisonment. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. In 1998 when Mr.
    Eslami was transferred to a prison in Karaj, he was able to escape with
    the help of friends. (Entekhab newspaper on October 24, 2000) Arrest and
    detention Mr. Eslami was traced and arrested by police detectives, prison
    agents, and Intelligence Ministry agents during a special police operation
    in Hashemi Street in Tehran a year after his escape in 1999 (Entekhab
    newspaper on October 24, 2000). The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch 28 of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Tehran tried Mr. Eslami in several sessions. However, no
    information is available on his trial. (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper) Charges
    According to the Social and informational Deputy of Judiciary, the charges
    brought against Mr. Eslami were announced as several incidents of assault
    and battery using a knife and cutlass, creating fear and insecurity,
    threatening to murder, kidnapping people s children, occupying people s
    land forcefully, and drinking alcoholic beverages. (Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper). The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the
    existing information, the evidence presented against Mr. Eslami was having
    a record for sedition and hooliganism, and his escape from the prison.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Eslami s defense. However, his
    attorney was present during the trial. Judgment Branch 28 of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tehran identified Mr. Bahman Eslami as Mofsed
    [corruptor on Earth] and condemned him to death. The Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in Tehran on November 6, 2000 at dawn.
