    News of the execution of Mr. Abdolmohammad Hosseini, along with five
    others, was published in the Jomhuri-Eslami newspaper on July 11, 2000.
    Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on Mr. Abdolmohammad
    Hosseini s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Abdolmohammad Hosseini s trial. According to the report, the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court investigated the case against these defendants.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Abdolmohammad Hosseini were announced as
    "dealing 204 kilograms of opium in Jiroft and Kahnuj; purchasing, hiding,
    transporting, and selling 2 kilograms of heroin; participation in dealing
    and transporting 10 kilograms of hashish; addiction to opium; and
    continuous activity in dealing and trafficking narcotics including opium,
    morphine, and heroin." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Abdolmohammad Hosseini. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Abdolmohammad Hosseini's defense. Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Abdolmohammad Hosseini to death and the ruling was
    confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was executed on July 8, 2000. No
    specific information is available about the location of this execution.
