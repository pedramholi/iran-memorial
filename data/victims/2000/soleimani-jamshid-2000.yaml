    News of the execution of Mr. Jamshid Soleimani was published in the Iran
    newspaper on November 22, 2000. His case was related to the murder of an
    individual at Darbgonbad in Kuhdasht during a fight over stealing a
    chicken and a rooster in 1998. According to the existing information, Mr.
    Soleimani was under 18 when the crime was committed. International laws
    have strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were under
    the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the
    Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of
    the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an
    offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Soleimani s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Branch One of the Public Court of Kuhdasht tried Mr. Soleimani. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Soleimani was announced as murder. According to the report, the court
    charged him with the murder of Mr. Cheragh ali Safarpur during a fight at
    Darbgonbad in Kuhdasht in 1998. No detailed information is available on
    his charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Soleimani. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Soleimani s defense. He was only 17 when the crime was committed.
    Judgment Branch One of the Public Court of Kuhdasht condemned Mr. Jamshid
    Soleimani to death for murder. He was hanged in public at the Basij Square
    in Kuhdasht on November 21, 2000. No specific information is available
    about this execution.
