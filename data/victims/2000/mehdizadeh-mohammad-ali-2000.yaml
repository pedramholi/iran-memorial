    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Mehdizadeh was published in the
    Iran newspaper on September 3, 2000. He was a civil engineer. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Mehdizadeh s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Mehdizadeh s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Mehdizadeh was announced as murder.
    According to the existing information, he had gone to his ex-wife s house
    and killed her, firing three times, 18 months after they were divorced. No
    detailed information is available on his charges. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the existing
    information, the evidence presented against Mr. Mehdizadeh was his
    confession. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Mehdizadeh s defense. Judgment The Kerman Court condemned Mr. Mohammad
    Ali Mehdizadeh to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged in Kerman in September of 2000. No specific information is
    available about this execution.
