    News of the execution of Mr. Lal Mohammad Ghani Saber, son of Nur, along
    with two others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on February 24,
    2000. According to the Drug Control Headquarters report, his case and
    those of the other two defendants were related to the identification and
    arrest of several drug trafficking gangs in the Mazandaran province. He
    was a Zabol resident. Arrest and detention The Mazandaran Police arrested
    Mr. Ghani Saber. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Ghani Saber. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Ghani Saber was announced as armed trafficking of narcotics. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Ghani Saber was possession of 5,840 kilograms of opium.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Ghani Saber s defense. Judgment
    The Islamic Revolutionary Court condemned Mr. Lal Mohammad Ghani Saber to
    death. The Supreme Court and the General Public Prosecutor confirmed the
    ruling and he was hanged, along with two others, in Mazandaran in 2000. No
    specific information is available about this execution.
