    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Adam, along with another person, was
    published in the Entekhab newspaper on October 19, 2000. Arrest and
    detention According to the existing information, Mr. Adam was arrested on
    April 22, 2000 following the murder of a friend. The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 1601 of the Criminal
    Court of Tehran tried Mr. Adam. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Adam was announced as murder.
    According to the report, the court charged him with the murder of his
    friend, Abdolreza Shahbazi, whom he had fought over a pigeon game on April
    22, 2000. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Adam. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Adam s defense. Judgment Branch 1601 of the Criminal Court of Tehran
    condemned Mr. Mohammad Adam to death for murder. The Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling and he was hanged, along with another person, in Qasr
    Prison on October 18, 2000 in the morning. No more specific information is
    available about this execution.
