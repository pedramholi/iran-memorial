    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Isazadeh, along with another person, was
    published in the Entekhab newspaper on October 19, 2000. Arrest and
    detention According to the existing information, Mr. Isazadeh was arrested
    on June 2, 1998 following a murder. The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch 1603 of the Criminal Court of Tehran
    tried Mr. Isazadeh. No information is available on his trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Isazadeh was announced as murder. According to
    the report, the court charged him with the murder of a man by blows of a
    knife over a financial dispute on June 2, 1998. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Isazadeh. Defense No information is available on Mr. Isazadeh s defense.
    Judgment Branch 1603 of the Criminal Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Ali
    Isazadeh to death for murder. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and
    he was hanged, along with another person, in Qasr Prison on October 18,
    2000 in the morning. No more specific information is available about this
    execution.
