    News of the execution of Mr. Jalil Badali, along with two others, was
    published in the archive of the Emam Ali Digital Library, quoting the
    Kayhan newspaper on September 10, 2000. Mr. Badali s case was related,
    along with two other defendants, to the rape of a woman in a village near
    Orumieh. Arrest and detention Mr. Badali was arrested in a village near
    Orumieh. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Branch 22 of the Orumieh Court tried Mr. Badali and the other two
    defendants. No information is available on his trial. Charges According to
    the Head of Public Relations Office of the Azarbaijan-e Gharbi Courthouse,
    the charge brought against Mr. Badali and the other two defendants was
    announced as rape. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Badali. Defense This case was referred to
    the Supreme Court due to the objection of Mr. Badali s attorney; however,
    his objection was rejected. No information is available on his defense.
    Judgment Branch 22 of the Orumieh Court condemned Mr. Jalil Badali to
    death. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and he was hanged, along
    with two others, at the Orumieh Central Prison yard in 2000.
