    News of the execution of Mr. Kiumars and two other defendants was
    published in the Iran newspaper on August 21, 2000. According to the
    existing information, Mr. Kiumars and the other defendants were members of
    an armed robber gang consisting of seven individuals. They wore police
    uniform and committed armed robberies across Iran. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of Mr. Kiumars s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Public Court of Karaj tried Mr. Kiumars. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Kiumars
    were announced as main member and the leader of a network of armed
    robbery, extortion, and banditry. No detailed information is available on
    his charge. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Kiumars. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Kiumars s defense. Judgment The Public Court of Karaj condemned Mr.
    Kiumars to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged, along with the two other defendants of this case, in the presence
    of the Sentence Enforcement of the Courthouse at Raja ishahr Prison in
    Karaj on August 20, 2000 in the morning. No more specific information is
    available about this execution.
