circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Gholam Ali Mardani was published in the
    Kayhan newspaper on January 17, 2000. His case was related to the
    harassment of 10 young boys and girls during the decade between 1989 and
    1999. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Mardani s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch Three of the Najafabad Court tried
    Mr. Mardani. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Mardani were announced as kidnapping and murder. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Mardani. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mardani s defense.
    Judgment Branch Three of the Najafabad Court condemned Mr. Gholam Ali
    Mardani to death, 15 years imprisonment, and 90 lashes. The Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public in Najafabad on January 16,
    2000 at dawn.
