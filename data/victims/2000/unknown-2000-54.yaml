    News of the execution of an unknown person was published in the Iran
    newspaper on November 18, 2000. According to the report, this case was
    related to incidents of street harassment, robbery, and extortion by a
    cutlass in Kerman in 1999. Arrest and detention The defendant was arrested
    by Kerman police sometimes between 1999 and 2000. The circumstances of the
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial A court in Kerman
    tried this person as the first row defendant. No information is available
    on the defendant s trial. Charges According to the report, the defendant
    and his collaborator were charged with carjacking, providing rides to
    people as passengers, and robbing their valuables and money by threatening
    them with a cutlass. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant s defense. Judgment The court condemned the
    defendant to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. This
    individual was hanged in Kerman Central Prison on November 22, 2000. No
    specific information is available about the defendant s execution. The
    other defendant of this case was condemned to 13 years imprisonment for
    assisting in the crime.
