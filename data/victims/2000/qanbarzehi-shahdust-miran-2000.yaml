    News of the execution of Mr. Shahdust Miran Qanbarzehi, son of Abdollah,
    along with five others, was published in the Jomhuri-Eslami newspaper on
    July 11, 2000. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on
    Mr. Miran Qanbarzehi s arrest and detention. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Miran Qanbarzehi s trial. According to the report, the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court investigated the case against these
    defendants. Charges The charges against Mr. Miran Qanbarzehi were
    announced as "dealing 1,810 kilograms of opium and 200 kilograms of
    morphine in 4 occasions, continuous activity in distribution and
    trafficking narcotics across the country along with armed convoys." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Miran Qanbarzehi. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Miran Qanbarzehi's defense. Judgment The court condemned
    Mr. Miran Qanbarzehi to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme
    Court. He was executed on July 8, 2000. No specific information is
    available about the location of this execution.
