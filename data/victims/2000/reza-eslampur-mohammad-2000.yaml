    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Eslampur was published on the
    website of the Hamshahri newspaper on February 28, 2000. He was from
    Lahijan and his case was related to the murder of a 23-year-old man.
    According to the report, after he had an argument with the victim at a
    birthday party, he stabbed him with a knife. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Eslampur s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Branch Four of the Public Court of Lahijan tried Mr. Eslampur. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges According to the Head of
    Lahijan Courthouse, the charge brought against Mr. Eslampur was announced
    as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Eslampur. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Eslampur s defense. Judgment Branch Four of the Public Court of Lahijan
    condemned Mr. Mohammad Reza Eslampur to death. The Supreme Judicial
    Council confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at Malek-Ashtar Prison in
    Lahijan. No more specific information is available about this execution.
