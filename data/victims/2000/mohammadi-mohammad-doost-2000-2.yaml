    News and information regarding the execution of Mr. Mohammad Doost
    Mohammadi, son of Abolfazl, known as Mohammad-Tatar and Mohammad-Commando,
    was provided to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center via three electronic forms by
    persons familiar with his case (1/16/2021, 9/29/2020, 11/24/2016). News of
    his execution was also published in the Ettela at newspaper on November 7,
    2000. Mr. Doost Mohammadi was born in Tehran in 1973. He was single, a
    professional with ninth grade education. According to one source, he was
    originally from Khalaj in Qom (e-form 1/16/21). Arrest and Detention
    Information Ministry Agents arrested Mr. Doost Mohammadi at his house in
    Hossein Abad-e Dulab, in Tehran, in 1996 with an arrest warrant (e-forms
    9/29/2020 and 11/24/2016). He was detained in Qasr and Evin prisons
    (e-form 11/24/2016). However, based on two other electronic forms, he was
    detained in Raja i shahr prison (e-forms 1/16/2021, 9/29/2020). Trial The
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran tried Mr. Doost Mohammadi. Charges
    The charge against Mr. Mohammad Doost Mohammadi was announced as "negation
    of the internal security." His charges, according to the newspaper report,
    were described as, initiating several fights and clashes with others and
    with officials; dishonoring the public savagely, including removing girls
    veils; committing heinous acts of sodomy, adultery, and having
    illegitimate relationships; having a single and secure house for acts
    incompatible with chastity; disturbing public order; blockading roads and
    extorting people; having parties and orgies; drinking, supplying, and
    selling alcoholic beverages on several occasions; dealing, possession, and
    using narcotics; and provoking prisoners to create riots. ( Ettela t
    Newspaper 11/7/2020) The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt No
    evidence existed against Mr. Doost Mohammadi (e-forms 1/16/2021,
    11/24/2016). Defense According to a person who knew Mr.Doost Mohammadi, he
    was innocent and had not committed any crime (e-form 11/24/16). Judgment
    The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Mohammad Doost
    Mohammadi to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged in November of 2000 ( Ettela at Newspaper 11/7/2020). Mr. Doost
    Mohammadi was hanged in public at the Emam Hossein Square in Tehran and
    his body was buried at Section 210 in the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in
    Tehran (e-forms 11/6/21, 9/29/20). But according to one electronic form,
    he was hanged at the Evin prison (e-form 11/24/16). According to the
    available information, nobody came forward to kick off the chair from
    under Mr. Doost Mohammadi (to hang him), but Mr. Doost Mohammadi
    recognized a soldier from his neighborhood (Hossein Abad-e Dollab) and
    asked him to be the one to kick off the chair (e-form 9/29/2020).
