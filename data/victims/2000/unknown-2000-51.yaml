    News of the execution of an unknown person, along with another individual,
    was published in the Kayhan newspaper on May 27, 2000. This case was
    related to the kidnapping and murder of a five-year-old child held for
    extortion in Susangerd. Arrest and detention The circumstances of the
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges brought against
    the defendant and his collaborator were announced as kidnapping and murder
    of a five-year-old child. According to the report, these two defendants
    kidnapped the child, who was a relative, and demanded 30 million Tumans
    from his family. But, they murdered the child before receiving the money.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against the
    defendant was having a record for sedition and kidnapping. Defense No
    information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment This
    individual was hanged, along with another person, in Susangerd on May 25,
    2000.
