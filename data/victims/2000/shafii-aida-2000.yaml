    News of the execution of Ms. Aida Shafi i, along with two others, was
    published on the website of Iran Mania on July 24, 2000, quoting the
    Khorasan newspaper. Her case and the case of her husband, Seyyed Esma il
    Zendeh, was related to the murder of a couple by gunshots in 1997 Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of Ms. Shafi i s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on Ms. Shafi i s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Ms. Shafi i and her husband was
    announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Ms. Shafi i was her confession during the
    police interrogation in Tehran. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Ms. Shafi i s defense. Judgment Ms. Aida Shafi i was hanged, along with
    two others, at a prison in Tehran on July 23, 2000.
