    News of the execution of Mr. Abbas Qasemi was published in the Ettela at
    newspaper on October 17, 2000. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on Mr. Qasemi s arrest and detention. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Qasemi s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Qasemi was
    announced as "kidnapping several minor girls." The newspaper did not
    report any other information about the charge. Evidence of Guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Qasemi. Defense No information is available
    on Qasemi's defense. A Summary of the Legal Defects in Mr. Abbas Ghassemi
    s Case The information is not complete regarding the present case. It is
    not clear what objectives the kidnapper pursued in carrying out the act
    and how he treated the little girl he kidnapped. It seems, however, that
    Mr. Abbas Qasemi was tried and sentenced to death on the charge of
    Moharebeh ( Waging war with God ) and Efsad fel-Arz ( Spreading corruption
    on Earth ). In Iranian courts, if kidnapping is armed kidnapping, has
    social consequences, and/or is accompanied with rape, the perpetrator is
    usually tried on the charge of Moharebeh and Efsad fel-Arz. If [the
    defendant in this case] had simply kidnapped the little girl, he should
    have been tried on the charge of kidnapping. Pursuant to Islamic Penal
    Code Article 621*, kidnapping carries a punishment of three to fifteen
    years of Ta zir imprisonment, regardless of the objectives of the crime,
    and if the victim is under 15 years of age, the perpetrator will be
    sentenced to the maximum punishment, that is, 15 years. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Abbas Qasemi to death. He was hanged in public at the
    Nobovat Square, in Qom, on October 15, 2000. ---------------- *Article
    621- Anyone who, whether personally or through someone else, forcefully or
    by resorting to threat or deception or any other means, abducts or
    conceals someone in order to blackmail or take revenge or for any reason,
    shall be sentenced to five to fifteen years imprisonment. If the victim is
    less than fifteen years old or if the abduction is carried out with a
    vehicle or if the victim is physically or sexually abused, the offender
    shall be sentenced to the maximum punishment provided; and if he has
    committed any other crimes he shall be sentenced to the relevant
    punishments as well. Note- Attempted abduction is punishable by three to
    five years imprisonment.
