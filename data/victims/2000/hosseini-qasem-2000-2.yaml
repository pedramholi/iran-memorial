    News of the execution of Mr. Qasem Hosseini, along with four others, was
    published in the Hamshahri newspaper on April 11, 2000. Arrest and
    Detention The circumstances of Mr. Hosseini s arrest and detention, and
    whether he had an attorney, are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Hosseini s trial, except that Branch 1608 of the Criminal
    Court of Tehran investigated this case. Charges The charge against Mr.
    Hosseini was announced as "murder. According to the Hamshahri newspaper,
    Mr. Hosseini and two other individuals went to a house to commit robbery,
    where he killed the property owner by stabbing him with a knife on July
    14, 1998. Since Mr. Hosseini was 19 years old when executed in 2000, it is
    apparent that he had been under 18 years of age when committing the crime.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing a crime. As a
    party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on
    the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offense committed before the age of eighteen. Evidence
    of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Hosseini. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Hosseini's defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Qasem Hosseini to Qesas (the death penalty), and Branch 26
    of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at the Qasr
    prison yard on April 10, 2000.
