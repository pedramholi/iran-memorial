    News of the execution of Mr. Yusef Khaki Fasmida i was published in the
    Resalat newspaper on July 1, 2000. Arrest and detention According to the
    existing information, Mr. Khaki Fasmida i was arrested in 1998 following a
    murder. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Branch One of the Public Court of Minab tried Mr. Khaki Fasmida i. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Khaki Fasmida i was announced as murder. According to the report, the
    court charged him with the murder of Mr. Mohammad Reza Malekizadeh in
    1998. No detailed information is available on his charge. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Khaki Fasmida i. Defense No information is available on Mr. Khaki Fasmida
    i s defense. Judgment Branch One of the Public Court of Minab condemned
    Mr. Yusef Khaki Fasmida i to death for murder. Branch 34 of the Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling. By the request of the victim s family, he was
    hanged on June 29, 2000 in the morning. No specific information is
    available about this execution.
