    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Vosuq, son of Mohammad, along with
    five others, was published in the Jomhuri-Eslami newspaper on July 11,
    2000. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on Mr. Vosuq s
    arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on Mr. Vosuq s
    trial. According to the report, the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    investigated the case against these defendants. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Vosuq were announced as "dealing and transporting 301
    kilograms of heroin, dealing 14 kilograms of opium, and addiction to
    narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Vosuq was recovery of 131 kilograms of heroin and having a
    record for six criminal offenses. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Vosuq's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hossein Vosuq to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was executed
    on July 8, 2000. No specific information is available about the location
    of this execution.
