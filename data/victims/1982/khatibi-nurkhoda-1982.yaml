    The execution of Mr. Nurkhoda Khatibi, along with four others, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on February 21, 1982. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Khatibi was reported to be charged with transporting 22 kg and
    600 gm of opium as well as having a record in wide-scale drug trafficking.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against defendants cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Khatibi's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Nahavand sentenced Mr. Khatibi to death. The sentence was
    carried out.
