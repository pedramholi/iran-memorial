    Information about the execution of Mr. Jadidollah (also spelled "
    Jadidu'llah") Ashraf and three other Baha is, was obtained from an
    announcement by the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qazvin published in
    Kayhan Daily Newspaper (June 11, 1982), Prosecutor of Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Qazvin s official order regarding his burial
    procedure (July 10, 1982), and documents published the Archives of Baha i
    Persecution in Iran. Mr. Jadidollah Ashraf is also one of the 206 Iranian
    Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i International
    Community. The report documents the persecution of the members of the Baha
    i faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists members killed since
    1978. Additional information has been drawn from various issues of The
    Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Mr.
    Jadidollah Asharf was born on March 21st, 1925 in Qazvin (ABPI, Bio). In
    1943, he and his family relocated to Tehran, however, in 1946, with the
    intention of promoting Baha i principles, he moved back to a small town in
    the suburbs of Qazvin (ABPI, Bio). Shortly after, he was elected to the
    Local Spiritual Assembly of Qazvin, where he served until 1982 (ABPI,
    Bio). The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300,000 members in 1979(1) - to systematic harassment and
    persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The
    Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic
    Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result,
    the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status of a
    religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are
    banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice
    has subjected them to abuse and violence. Persecution of Baha is in Iran
    is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era
    that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself,
    religious zealots often encouraged by local clerics attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini has previously spoken of the
    Baha i s as a threat to the Islam, national unity, and national security
    in various speeches (Asoo website, October 6, 2015) and referred to them
    as spies'' supported by Britian and America (Sahifeye Noor, Volume 17, May
    28, 1982). The Baha is deny these allegations, stating that a key
    religious principle of Baha is is a requirement of staying out of politics
    . They say that religious relations know no bounds, and that the Iranian
    Baha i Spiritual Assembly has done nothing, and taken no action, against
    the Islamic Republic (Asoo website, August 9, 2015). For example, Baha is
    were and still are accused of being agents of Zionism . In part, the
    evidence for this accusation is that the international council of the Baha
    i faith and the highest decision-making authority in the world Baha i
    community, Beit-al-Adl ( House of Justice ), is in Haifa. It must be noted
    that the Beit-al-Adl was established in Haifa at a time when the state of
    Israel did not exist. The Islamic Republic Penal Code grants no rights to
    Baha is, and the courts have denied them the right to redress or
    protection against assault, murder, and other forms of persecution and
    abuse. In so doing, the courts have treated Baha is as unprotected
    citizens or apostates, citing eminent religious authorities whose edicts
    are considered a source of law equal to acts of Parliament. The Founder of
    the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, made execution a punishment for
    the crime of apostasy and decreed that a Muslim would not be punished for
    killing an apostate. Spiritual Assemblies The affairs of the Baha i
    community are administered through a system of institutions, each with its
    defined sphere of action. At the local level, the affairs of the Baha i
    community are administered by the Local Spiritual Assembly and nationally
    by a National Spiritual Assembly . In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second,
    and Third National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i Spiritual
    Assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz,
    were severely persecuted and the majority of members were executed.
    Spiritual Assemblies have been banned by the Iranian government, denying
    Baha is the right to meet, elect, and operate their religious
    institutions. Judicial officials of the Islam
