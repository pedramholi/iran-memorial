    The execution of Mr. Gol Ahmad Kuhkan, along with another defendant, was

    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Kuhkan was charged with possessing and selling 2.670 kg of
    heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against defendants
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Kuhkan's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Qom sentenced Mr. Kuhkan to death. This sentence was carried
    out.
