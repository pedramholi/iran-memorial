    News of the execution of Mr. Behzad Aberi, son of Baha odin, along with
    seventeen others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on September
    18, 1982. The information about Mr. Aberi is based on information sent to
    Omid by a person familiar with his case. According to this information, he
    was born in Sanandaj. He was married and a student at Tehran University.
    He was a sympathizer of a radical socialist group. His mother, Ms. Farasat
    Chovoshinejad, was killed during the government attack on Kurdistan in
    1980. Arrest and Detention According to the information sent to Omid, he
    was denied the right to an attorney or to defend himself. Authorities
    pressured him to introduce his fellow comrades, reject his beliefs and
    actions, and accept the official ideology in a televised interview, accept
    all charges, work in prison to convert other prisoners, and to ask them to
    work for the regime. Mr. Aberi rejected all these suggestions. Trial
    According to the information sent to Omid, quoting a cellmate, the trial
    session of Mr. Aberi took only five minutes. No further information is
    available on the details of the defendant s trial. Charges According to
    the report of the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, Mr. Aberi and other defendants
    were collectively charged with collaboration with the
    counter-revolutionary groups who are enemies of God, activities against
    the Islamic Republic, attacking the fellow members of the police and
    military forces, trading weapons, extortion, committing the hideous act of
    sodomy, drug dealing and having relations with the members of the infidel
    Baath party. There is no mention of the specific charges against the
    defendant. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual offenses, and other criminal
    activities. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Aberi. Defense No information is available about Mr. Aberi s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sanandaj declared
    Mr. Aberi an enemy of God and a corruptor and sentenced him to death.
    According to the information sent to Omid, he was executed by firing squad
    in Sanandaj on September 12, 1982. Authorities asked the family for the
    cost of three spent bullets and a cake, in order for the body to be
    returned. However, after receiving what they asked for, they refused to
    deliver the body. Mr. Aberi s family does not know where his grave is
    located.
