    The execution of Mr. Hassan Sanjari was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on April 18, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Sanjari was charged with
    concealing 2134 kilogram of opium in an oil tanker, transporting and
    storing it. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Sanjari's defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz found Mr. Sanjari guilty of being a
    corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death.
