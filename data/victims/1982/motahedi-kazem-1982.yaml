    Mr. Kazem Motahedi (Forqan) is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Forqan was formed in 1977 by a group of Ali Shari
    ati s followers with a modern interpretation of the Qoran and Islamic
    ideology. It is not clear whether or not the group was armed, but it went
    underground soon after its formation. Based on documents available in the
    archives of the Islamic Revolution Documentation Center (gathered and
    reported by Ahmad Gudarzi on Bacheha-ye Ghalam website), this group
    opposed from the onset of the Revolution the involvement of the clergy in
    the government and the particular interpretation of Islam later
    implemented by the Islamic Republic authorities. In its short period of
    post-revolutionary activity, the group was accused of involvement in
    several assassinations and armed robberies, the first one reportedly as
    early as May 1979, only a couple of months after the triumph of the
    Revolution. Based on the above mentioned report, most of the known members
    of the group were executed or killed in clashes with Islamic Revolutionary
    Committee forces, which led to the total elimination of the group in
    January 1980. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Motahedi s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Motahedi s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Motahedi s is
    not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense

    no information on the verdict leading to this execution.
