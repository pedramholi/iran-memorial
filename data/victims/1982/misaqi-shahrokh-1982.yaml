    farming family. He was a medical student at Hortense (?) University in
    Manila, Philippines. He was an active member of the supporters of the
    Fedaiyan Khalq Organization (Minority) Akhgar Group (Brigham Young
    University Archives, March 12, 2013; Jahan Publication, January 1983 and
    December 1984; Interview with Behrang Ejtehadi, April 18, 2024). Mr.
    Misaqi s friends remember him as a calm person, kind, cheerful, and
    sociable (Eshterak Weblog, December 7, 2010; Student Struggles in the
    Philippines Facebook page, March 1, 2011). Mr. Misaqi was among the
    students who distributed leaflets and who organized serial demonstrations
    in opposition to the Islamic Republic in front of the Iranian Embassy in
    the Philippines. They had been able to attract some Filipino friends to
    their cause and have them join in these demonstrations (Manila Standard
    Today, August 14, 1987; Interview with Behrang Ejtehadi, April 18, 2024).
    He was among the students whose student rate financial aid had been cut
    off because of their political activities against the Islamic Republic of
    Iran (Assistance Inside the Country Facebook page, March 11, 2021; Reesman
    Site, March 23, 2020). The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly
    in the political arena and the labor movement. Background of Student
    Movement in the Philippines The Iranian Student Movement in the
    Philippines was established before January 1979, as was the case in many
    other countries. Iranians had started to enroll in Philippine colleges and
    universities since the early 1980s. Students were attracted to these
    institutions of higher learning for their low-cost tuition and use of
    English language. Before the revolution, between 2500 3500 students were
    studying in the Philippines. Many of them had government sponsored
    scholarships ( Muslim communities of the Southern Philippines , Moshe
    Yegar, 2002). Prior to the revolution, students actively opposed the
    government of the Shah in different political groups such as Members and
    Supporters of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran, People s Loyalty
    Organization of Iran, Tudeh Party, Union of Iranian Communists, Islamist
    Supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini, etc. After the revolution in January
    1979, when Ayatollah Khomeini seized power as leader of the revolution,
    differences between all of these political groups and the supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini grew larger within the country, and eventually
