    The information about Ms. Nastaran Akhlaqi has been sent to Omid through
    an electronic form by one of her cellmates who was in prison with her in
    1981. Ms. Akhlaqi is also one of the 430 individuals whose name appears on
    the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class published on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list
    contains the names of those members of the Organization who died after the
    Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. This execution was also announced in the addendum of the
    Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated
    with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes
    with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the
    publication date of the magazine. Ms. Akhlaqi was a student and
    sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. Her father, who was a supporter of
    the Islamic Republic, reported her to the authorities. She told her
    cellmates, after a visitation by her family sometime after her arrest,
    that her father never expected his daughter to be condemned to death. He
    had rather thought that reporting her to the authorities would guide her
    in the right path and save her. Ayatollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic
    religious leader, had declared spying among neighbors and relatives to be
    a personal duty. In a speech on July 2, 1981, he stated: Today, it is the
    obligation of the nation to pay attention and identify these saboteurs and
    report them to committees and courts and any other nearby place Today,
    each of you should be a member of the Intelligence Ministry. Everyone of
    us is obligated to report these saboteurs [to the authorities] when we
    identify them. We have to try to identify them and report them, so that
    the police and military forces can hand them over to the court in order
    for these individuals to be prosecuted. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    Ms. Akhalqi was arrested in the summer of 1981, and according to her
    cellmate, she was tortured. Initially, her role in the Peykar organization
    was not disclosed to her interrogators. Ms. Akhlaqi spent some time in the
    medical unit of Evin Prison. In mid-November 1981, along with others
    cellmates of the medical unit, she was transferred to Unit 240, Room
    number 6, which was assigned to leftist prisoners. After her role and
    activism in the Peykar Organization was disclosed to the authorities, once
    again she was taken for interrogation and tortured and her feet were
    flogged. Her cellmate saw the wounds on her feet in the corridor leading
    to interrogation rooms. After that she was transferred to another unit. No
    specific information is available regarding Ms. Akhlaqi s visitation with
    her family. Based on the testimony of individuals in Evin, during this
    period, after June 20, 1981, no visitation was allowed for political
    prisoners. Visitations resumed in March of 1982. The dates of upcoming
    visitations were announced in newspapers. Visitors were behind a glass
    window. It was impossible to speak openly and freely and one had to use
    gestures and allusions. After about six months, telephones were installed
    in the cabins and visitations were allowed once a month. Conversations
    during visitations were monitored by prison authorities through the
    telephones. Prisoners, whose interrogations were not completed, were not
    allowed any visitation. Trial No information is available on the defendant
    s trial. Charges No information is available on the charges against Ms.
    Akhlaqi. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on her defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Ms. Nastaran Akhlaqi to death. She was
    executed on September 29, 1982.
