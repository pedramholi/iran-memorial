circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ali Sa'idi, along with two others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily, quoting the public relations of the Islamic
    Revolution Guards Corps of the fourth district in Mashad on January 14,
    1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Sa'idi's charges
    are not specified, he and two other convicts are generally charged with
    immorality, acts incompatible with chastity and dealing opium and other
    narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year hundreds of alleged common criminals are convicted following
    judicial processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact
    number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.

    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Sa'idi's defense. Judgment The Islamic
