    Ms.Leila Motevasel (Mojahedin Khalq Iran) is one of the 12028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Further information about Ms.
    Motevasel is taken from the Mojahedin Khalq Organization s website. She
    was born in Shiraz. She was a university student, a sympathizer of the
    MKO, and a member of its Resistance Unit in Shiraz. Arrest and detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention.
    According to the MKO website, Ms. Motevasel was probably arrested after
    the June 20, 1981 demonstrations. She was detained for about a year in
    both the Adelabad and Shiraz prisons. The demonstration of June 20, 1981,
    was protesting the parliament's impeachment of President Banisadr and the
    Islamic Republic's systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) from politics, as well as Ayatollah Khomeini s refusal
    to meet with MKO leaders and his desire to neutralize their power. Until
    that time, the MKO had supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    agreed to function within the framework of the new political system.
    However, on June 20th, 1981, MKO officially changed its policy and tried
    to overthrow the regime by organizing mass demonstrations throughout the
    country. These demonstrations were severely suppressed and resulted in the
    killing of dozens of demonstrators. Afterwards there was a wave of mass
    arrests and executions by the Revolutionary Guards and paramilitary forces
    targeting not only the MKO, but all other opposition groups as well. The
    massive repression was unprecedented in the history of the Islamic
    Republic. It legitimized the months-old state harassment and suppression
    of dissidents. The result was the prohibition of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Trial No information is available on the defendant s
    trial. According to the website of the Mojahedin, Ms. Motevasel told one
    of her cellmates that a court had condemned her to three years
    imprisonment after her arrest; but they started to interrogate her again.
    No information is available about whether she had another trial or not.
    Charges No information is available on Ms. Motevasel s charges. Evidence
    of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms.
    Motevasel's defense. Judgment No specific information is available about
    this execution. According to the MKO website, Ms. Motevasel was executed
    by a firing squad in the Shiraz Prison on December 17, 1982.
    _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981,
    the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and
    assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the
    Islamic regime. In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the
    impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they
    founded the National Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many
    of its members were expelled from France, they went to Iraq and founded
    the National Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which entered Iranian
    territory a few times during the Iran-Iraq war. They were defeated in July
    1988 during their last operation, the Forugh Javidan Operation. A few days
    after this operation, thousands of imprisoned Mojahedin supporters were
    killed during the mass executions of political prisoners in 1988. Ever
    since the summer of 1981, the MKO has continued its activities outside of
    Iran. No information is available regarding members and activities
