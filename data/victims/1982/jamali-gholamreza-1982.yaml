    Information about Mr. Gholamreza Jamali is based on an electronic form
    sent to Omid by a person familiar with this case. According to this
    information, he was born in Ahvaz in 1959. He was single, a conscripted
    soldier, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Mr.
    Gholamreza Jamali is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No. 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    The organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary,
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a split with the
    Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the
    imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along with other
    political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to recruit new
    members, based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and Detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Gholamreza Jamali s arrest and detention are not known. According
    to the information sent to Omid, he was arrested in Ahvaz. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Gholamreza Jamali s trial. According to
    the information sent to Omid, the Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz tried him.
    Charges According to information sent to Omid, the charge brought against
    Mr. Gholamreza Jamali was sympathizing with the Mojahedin Khalq. Evidence
    of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Gholamreza Jamali. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Gholamreza Jamali s defense. Judgment No
    specific information is available about Mr. Gholamreza Jamali s execution.
    According to the Mojahed report, he was executed by firing squad in Ahvaz,
    in the summer of 1982. The electronic form indicated that he was executed
    on prophecy anniversary day in 1982. _________________________ * The
    exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of their
    centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with the Islamic Republic
    authorities different interpretations of Islam, widened the gap between
    the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as
    hypocrites and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
    treatment by governmental officials and the government officials efforts
    to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact
    that the regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollahis.
    The number of casualties resulting from this demonstration is unknown, but
    a large number of demonstrators were arrested and executed in the
    following days and weeks. The day after the demonstration, the Islamic
    Republic regime started a repressive campaign unprecedented in modern
    Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and sympathizers were arrested
    or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO announced an armed struggle against
    the Islamic Republic and assassinated a number of high-ranking officials
    and supporters of the Islamic regime. In the summer of 1981, the leader of
    the MKO and the impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in
    France, where they founded the National Council of Resistance. After the
    MKO leaders and many of its members were expelled from France, they went
    to Iraq and founded the National Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which
    entered Iranian territory a few times during the Iran-Ira
