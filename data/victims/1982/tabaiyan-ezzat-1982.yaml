    Information about Ms. Ezzat Taba iyan was obtained through an interview
    with her husband, Mr. Majid Naficy, and from some of his writings*. The
    news of Ms. Taba iyan s execution also appeared in the appendix of Mojahed
    Bulletin published by the People s Mojahedin of Iran Organization (Issue #
    261, September 6, 1985). The appendix lists 12028 individuals with
    different political affiliations who were executed by or killed during
    conflict with the Islamic Republic forces from June 20, 1981 until the
    bulletin s publication in 1985. Ms. Ezzat Taba iyan, daughter of Javad,
    was born in Isfahan in 1957. She was married and was a senior-year student
    in Physiotherapy at Tehran University. She started her political activism
    during the Shah s regime, initially tending towards the Mojahedin and
    later joining the Marxist-Leninists. As a student activist in 1977, she
    made and distributed flyers with the help of her friend, protesting the
    regulations imposed on the Amirabad female students dormitory which
    limited the girls mobility at nights. These regulations failed as a result
    of widespread protest. After a while, Ms. Taba iyan extended her
    activities from student to worker environments. She worked at the I.D.A
    and Belmond pharmaceutical factory for a while in order to establish
    connections with workers. She joined the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class right before the revolution in January
    1979. After the revolution, she became a member of the Tehran branch of
    the D-D Committee (university and pre-university student committee of
    Peykar) and took on the responsibility of directing university and
    pre-university students who sympathized with Peykar. The activities
    organized by the Committee at that time included demonstrations,
    publishing and distributing student books and magazines, and
    mountaineering trips during which the positions and tactics of the
    Organization were explained to sympathizers. Arms were not used in any of
    these activities. In one of his essays, Ms. Taba iyan s husband writes in
    her memory: You end your letter [your will] with a slogan which implies
    your ideological heroes, with a salute to those whom I have always loved,
    love and shall love. You are dying, yet you believe that even after death
    you will continue to love them because ideology will survive you.
    Nevertheless, there is one phrase in your will which I couldn t justify in
    terms of our ideology. Being afraid of my friends reaction, I even wanted
    to wipe it out. Before you signed and dated the letter, you wrote the
    common idiom which Iranians say when departing, khoda hafez (goodbye), and
    literally means may God protect you. I wish you had used another phrase
    which did not have a religious connotation. In a society where religion is
    the state ideology, no wonder that atheism becomes the slogan of
    rebellion. Political ideology may change, but ethical conviction remains.
    You stood up against those who wanted to take your personhood from you.
    This is a precious heritage for me, who can only be one of the executors
    of your will. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention Ms. Ezzat Taba iyan was participating in
    an organizational meeting at the home of a Peykar sympathizer in Aryashahr
    on September 20, 1981. Information about the place had been leaked by one
    of the former members of the group. Around 2 P.M., the guards arrived and
    started arresting the participants. Ms. Taba iyan tried to escape. Based
    on the information available, one of the guards shot at her but the bullet
    did not hit her and she was able to run out of the back door, climb the
    wall, and throw herself in the neighbor s backyard, breaking her pelvis.
    The neighbor who was a Hezbollah supporter refused to help her and,
    instead, kept her in the house and called the guards. The guards arrested
    Ms. Taba iyan, who was unable to move due to her broken pelvis, and took
    her to Sorayya (Namdaran) Hospital. She was under treatment at this
    hospital for a month while the guards were not certain of her real
    identity. She was kept in a room in the basement of the hospital and was
    watched by armed guards. While hospitalized, she was able to sneak a
