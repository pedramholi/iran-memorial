    The executions of Ms. Maryam Seyedabadi and another defendant were
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on February 21, 1982. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Ms. Seyedabadi was reported to be charged with frequent
    adulteries. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, hundreds of alleged common criminals are convicted following
    judicial processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact
    number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Seyedabadi's defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Neishabur sentenced Ms. Seyedabadi to
    death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence
    was carried out.
