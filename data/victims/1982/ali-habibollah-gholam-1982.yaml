    The execution of Mr. Habibollah Gholam Ali, along with twenty others, was
    announced by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotic section of the
    Islamic Republic Public Prosecution Office and reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on March 3, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Gholam Ali and another defendant possessed 275 gm of heroin the last
    time they were arrested. They had confessed to selling 150 gm of heroin,
    transporting heroin from Zahedan to Tehran and selling it many times. It
    is also mentioned that he did not even smoke cigarettes. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Gholam
    Ali s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office sentenced Mr. Gholam Ali to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out.
