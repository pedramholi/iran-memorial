circumstances: >
    The execution of this unnamed person, along with 8 others, was published
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on June 24, 1982, based on a report by the
    public relations division of the Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor's
    office of Mashad. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant
    s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges This unnamed person was reported to be
    charged with the hideous act of sodomy and adultery. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on this unnamed person's defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashad sentenced this unnamed person to death.
    The sentence was carried out.
