    Information regarding the execution of Mr. Amrollah Aqa i, son of
    Fazlollah, was sent to Omid via several electronic forms by persons
    familiar with the case. According to their information, Mr. Aqa i was born
    in Behbahan in 1960. He was a statistics student in Jondishapur University
    in Ahvaz and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. His name
    is listed among the victims of this organization on its website. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and to recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, whether by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic s
    leaders. * Arrest and Detention The circumstances of Mr. Aqa i s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Aqa
    i s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Aqa i is not known.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Aqa i. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Aqa i s defense. Judgment According to the
    information sent to Omid, Mr. Amrollah Aqa i was probably executed in
    Ahvaz in 1982. One electronic form reported Masjed-e Soleiman as the
    execution place; however, according to the latest electronic form and the
    website of the Mojahedin Khalq, he was executed in Ahvaz.
    _________________________ * The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretations of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites, and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting its treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown, but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981,
    the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and
    assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the
    Islamic regime. In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the
    impeached president (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they
    founded the National Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many
    of its members were expelled from France, they went to Iraq and founded
    the National Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which entered Iranian
    territory a few times during the Iran-Iraq war. They were defeated in July
    1988 during their last operation, the Forugh Javidan operation. A few days
    after this operation, thousands of imprisoned Mojahedin supporters were
    killed during the mass executions of political prisoners in 1988. Ever
    since the summer of 1981, the MKO has continued its activities outside of
    Iran. No information is available regarding members and activities of the
    MKO inside the country. In spite of the armed struggle announcement by the
    MKO on June
