    Had to give birth to her child while in prison News and information
    regarding the execution of Ms. Iran Rahimpur (Khoramieh/Khormai) was
    obtained from the Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran website.
    Additional information about this case was obtained from the website of
    Radio Zamaneh (December 21, 2013) as well as from electronic forms
    submitted to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center on March 8, and May 18,
    2019. Ms. Rahimpur was one of the 206 individuals whose name was published
    in the Worldwide Baha i Community s 1999 report. This report, entitled The
    Baha i Question: Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a
    Religious Community , dealt with the persecution of members of the Baha i
    faith in Iran by the Islamic Republic, and contained a list of Baha is who
    were killed in Iran since 1979. Ms. Rahimpur was born into a Moslem family
    in June-July 1938. She finished ninth grade and then went to Germany to
    continue her education. Upon obtaining her degree in Communications [and
    Transmissions] Engineering, she returned to Iran and was hired by the
    Telegraph and Telephone Company. She converted to the Baha i religion upon
    becoming familiar with it in 1976 through her sister. She moved to the
    town of Andimeshk in Khuzestan Province a year later in order to promote
    the Baha i faith. Ms. Rahimpur was married in 1979-80. (Archives of Baha i
    Persecution in Iran website; Radio Zamaneh website). The Baha is in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The Baha i religious community is the
    largest minority group in Iran, with approximately 300,000 members in 1979
    (more current figures are not available).* The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected Baha is religious to systematic harassment and
    persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The
    Baha i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic
    Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result,
    the Baha is have been denied the rights associated with the status of a
    religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith and are
    banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice
    has subjected them to abuse and violence. ** Arrest and detention Ms.
    Rahimpur was arrested in November-December 1980, along with her spouse.
    According to available information, Ms. Rahimpur was detained at the city
    of Dezful s prison. There is no information regarding the details of Ms.
    Rahimpur s arrest and detention. Ms. Rahimpur was pregnant at the time of
    her arrest, and gave birth to her child at Dezful Hospital in March-April
    1981, approximately four months into her detention, and was then returned
    to prison with her baby. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran website;
    Radio Zamaneh website). According to available information, Ms. Rahimpur
    did not have access to an attorney and was not able to visit with her
    family during detention. Trial The city of Dezful Revolutionary Court
    tried Ms. Rahimpur. There is no information about the date(s) of the trial
    or the details of the proceedings. Charges There are no information
    regarding the charges brought against Ms. Rahimpur. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Mehdizadeh. Defense No information is
    available on Ms. Rahimpur's defense. According to the statements made by
    the representatives of the Baha i community, the main reason for the
    arrest and prosecution of adherents of the Baha i faith is their religious
    beliefs. The information these representatives have obtained about their
    brethren indicates that the defendants requests to read the content of the
    case file are usually denied, and even though the defendants are allowed
    by law to avail themselves of legal representation, attorneys at law are
    under pressure not to accept any Baha i clients. Representatives of the
    Baha i community deny charges such as anti-revolutionary political
    activity or espionage leveled in courts against Baha is, and note that the
    constitutive principles of their faith require loyalty to a government and
    obedience thereto, and prohibits them from any interference in political
    affairs. These representatives add that espionage for Israel is another
    one of those baseless charges brought against adherents of the Baha i
    faith simply because the Baha is world headquarters is located there,
    whereas these headquarters were established in that location at the end of
    the 19th century, years before the establishment of the state of Israel.
    Judgement Dezful Islamic Revolutionary Court sentenced Ms. Iran Rahimpur
    (Khoramieh/ Khorma'i) to death and confiscation of her properties and
    possessions. Ms. Rahimpur was executed by firing squad on May 12, 1982 in
    Dezful Prison. Ms. Iranpur's body was never given to her family. The
