    The execution of Mr. Masha llah Khoshbayan was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami Daily, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office in Hamedan. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr.
    Khoshbayan was reported to be charged with selling 100 gm of heroin, and
    having a previous record for heroin trafficking. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Khoshbayan's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Hamedan found Mr. Khoshbayan guilty of being a corruptor on earth and
    sentenced him to death. The sentence was carried out.
