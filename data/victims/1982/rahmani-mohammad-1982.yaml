    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Rahmani, along with ten others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on December 22, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Rahmani was
    reported to be charged with being active in the supply and distribution of
    narcotics, pleading guilty for having transported 500 gm of heroin from
    Zahedan by plane for a smuggler, sale of 11.80 gm of heroin and being
    convicted 4 times. Also, his neighbors had complained about the way he
    exhorted the youth to drug addiction. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Rahmani's defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tehran sentenced Mr. Rahmani to death. The sentence was
    carried out.
