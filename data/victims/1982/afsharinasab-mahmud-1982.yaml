    Information about Mr. Mahmud Afsharinasab, son of Mohammad, is based on
    two electronic forms sent to Omid by persons familiar with this case.
    According to this information, he was born in Haftkel in 1960. He was
    single, an electronics student in Tabriz University, and a sympathizer of
    the Peykar organization. Mr. Mahmud Afsharinasab is one of the 559
    individuals whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class, published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar . This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state, believed that China
    had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed
    all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to the information sent to Omid, Mr. Mahmud Afsharinasab was
    arrested in a street in Omidieh, Aghajari, on his way home in August of
    1981 at 4 p.m. He was transferred to the Revolutionary Guards base in
    Miankuh. His friends informed his family of his arrest. His family was
    informed to visit him in a hospital where he was operated on, but
    authorities did not explain the reason for that operation. Mr. Mahmud
    Afsharinasab was detained for seven months during which he had only two
    visitations; the last one took place a month before his execution. Trial
    No information is available on Mr. Afsharinasab s trial. Charges According
    to one electronic form, the charges brought against Mr. Afsharinasab were
    announced as activity against the Islamic Republic regime and a lack of
    cooperation with the interrogators. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Afsharinasab. Defense No information is available about Mr.
    Afsharinasab s defense. According to the information sent to Omid, he was
    denied the right to an attorney or to defend himself. Judgment Mr. Mahmud
    Afsharinasab was executed by firing squad in Aghajari (in the
    south-western province of Khuzestan) on March 8, 1982. Marks of torture
    such as burns on his chest and hand were evident on his body when the
    family received it. He was buried in the old cemetery in Omidieh. A part
    of his will was given to his family.
