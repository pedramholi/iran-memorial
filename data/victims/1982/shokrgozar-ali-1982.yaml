    The execution of Mr. Ali Shokrgozar, along with two others, was published
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on April 5, 1982. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of
    the basic guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr.
    Shokrgozar was charged with “adultery and murder and burial of an innocent
    child who was the result of this religiously forbidden act”. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr.Shokrgozar's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Anzali Port sentenced Mr. Shokrgozar to death. The sentence
    was carried out.
