    The information about Mr. Shahrokh Zargar, son of Abdolmajid, is based on
    an interview by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with his sister, and
    an electronic form sent to Omid by her. News of his execution, along with
    five others, was published in the Ettela at newspaper on May 26, 1982. Mr.
    Zargar is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. According to the interviewee, Mr. Zargar was born in Ahvaz in
    December of 1960. He was single, a medical student at Jondishahpur
    University in Ahvaz, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. His political activities were limited to promotion of the
    organization. He was once arrested, in November of 1980, and condemned to
    three months imprisonment. He was arrested for the second time in a
    telephone booth on June 20, 1981 when he was beaten severely in a street
    and transferred to a hospital. Since he was a medical student, a nurse
    identified him and informed his family. Mr. Zargar had a heart problem and
    was about to be operated on. He was released because of his father s
    efforts, who was a judge at the time. Mr. Zargar was a clever and generous
    individual. He played chess and ping pong well and hoped to become a
    doctor who would not charge the poor. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principals of
    Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of
    Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the
    Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic
    and social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic s leaders. * Arrest and detention According to the
    existing information, Mr. Zargar was arrested in Ahvaz and transferred to
    the Karun Prison in August of 1981. The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. He had weekly visitations with his family from
    behind two fences and in the presence of a guard. During one of his last
    visitations, he expressed concern about his fate. He was not allowed to
    talk in the prison and even could not even leave his bed for some time.
    Trial Mr. Zargar was tried in Ahvaz about one month after his arrest in
    1981. According to the interviewee, his father s efforts resulted in a
    life sentence. No information is available whether there had been another
    trial condemning him to death. Charges According to the Ettela at
    newspaper, the charges brought against Mr. Zargar were membership of the
    organization [Mojahedin Khalq] in Khuzestan, being in charge of collecting
    weapons and ammunition in Abadan, being a high ranking member of the
    organization in prison, and being in charge of connections with the
    organization between inside and outside of the prison. According to the
    interviewee, however, his charge was being a Monafeq [Mojahed]. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Zargar. Defense No
    information is available about Mr. Zargar s defense. Judgment According to
    the existing information, Mr. Shahrokh Zargar was executed by firing squad
    in Ahvaz on May 23, 1982. According to the interviewee, quoting a person
    who was present at the time of Mr. Zargar s death, he and five others had
    been beaten so severely that they died before their executions.
