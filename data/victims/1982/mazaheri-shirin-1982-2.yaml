    One of Ms. Shirin Mazaheri’s former cellmates has provided the information
    about her through an electronic form. Ms. Mazehri’s is also one of the
    12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Ms. Shirin Mazaheri was
    a 22 year university student. She was slender and had balck eyes and black
    hair; she was very beautiful. Arrest and detention Ms. Mazaheri was
    arrested in November 1981 and taken to Evin prison. The details of her
    arrest are not known. During incommunicado detention, she was denied the
    right o have an attorney. Ms. Mazaheri spent the first few weeks of her
    detention in corridors leading to interrogation room where detainees were
    tortured. After interrogation, she was sent to Room 3 of section 240 of
    Evin prison. Her sister, who was a few years younger than her, was also
    kept in the same room. Ms. Mazaheri’s feet were wounded and bandaged due
    to torture. Sometimes, her sister took her arms and helped her walk about
    the corridor of the cell. The corridor was crowded but other cellmates
    respected the two sisters and would step out of the way for them. Walking
    was painful and difficult for Ms. Shirin Mazaheri but it helped the
    healing of the wounds of her feet. Trial There is no information regarding
    this trial. Charges The charges brought against the defendant are not
    known. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against the accused. Defense No information is
    available concerning Ms. Mazaheri’s defense. Judgment In the afternoon of
    January 2, 1982, Ms, Shirin Mazaheri’s name was called and she left the
    cell a few minutes later. Around 9 p.m., the cellmates of Section 4 (where
    Ms. Mazaheri had been detained) heard the firing squad followed by
    single-shots. Shirin’s sister knew that Shirin was condemned to death and
    was executed that night. She sobbed and cried for hour. This soon became a
    general mourning in the cell. At this time, mourning was banned in prison.
    Prisoners, who had recanted their political beliefs and now cooperated
    with prison guards, informed them of the mourning in the cell. After that
    the firing squad had a new location so that prisoners could rarely hear
    the shots.
