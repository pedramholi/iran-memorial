    Information about Ms. Shohreh Saburi has been sent to Omid by her former
    cellmate from Room 6 of Section 240 in Evin prison, via an electronic
    form. Ms. Saburi was affiliated with Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Minority
    branch). The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin
    America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic
    Republic and was active mainly in the political arena and the labor
    movement. Arrest and detention Ms. Saburi was arrested in the winter of
    1982 in Tehran, along with her husband, Mr. Fariborz Keshavarz, and her
    sister-in-law, by the Revolutionary Guards of Committee 3000, for their
    affiliation with the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. (Committee 3000 is the
    former Committee Against Sabotage, which was later renamed Tohidi prison;
    today it is a museum.) After interrogation, Ms. Saburi was transferred to
    Evin prison. She was detained in Room 6 of Section 240. She knew she would
    be executed and had confided this information to some of her trusted
    cellmates. During her detention she was denied visitation rights and the
    right to have an attorney. Trial There is no information regarding this
    trial. Charges The charges brought against the defendant in court are not
    known. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against the accused. Defense No information is
    available concerning Ms. Saburi’s defense. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the verdict leading to this execution. One
    afternoon in February/March 1982, Ms. Shohreh Saburi was called from
    section 240 and never returned. She and her husband were shot by a firing
    squad in Evin prison, along with a few other individuals.
