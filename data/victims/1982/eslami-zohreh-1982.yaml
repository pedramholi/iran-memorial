    Ms. Eslami was concerned about social issued since adolescence. She held a

    Boroumand Center through submission of an electronic form (December 12,
    2021, and May 3, 2022) by a person who knew her. News of this execution
    was also published on the Andisheh va Peykar website (Peykarandeesh.org)
    (research date: May 4, 2022). Additional information about this case was
    obtained from Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, page 7 (February 13, 1982); Ettela
    at newspaper, page 2 (March 18, 1979); Nedaye Azadi website (July-August
    2013): Eshterak website (February 7, 2018; July 29, 2020); List of Fadaiy
    Martyrs weblog (April 26, 2015); Lajavar website (March 7, 2018); the
    Communist Party of Iran website (July 23, 2005): Naqd-e Eghtessad-e Siasi
    ( Polotical Economy Critique ) website (April 27, 2021): and Political
    Studies and Research Institute website (May 28, 2021). Ms. Eslami was born
    in 1961-62 in a religious family in the city of Abadan. She was single and
    held a high school diploma. Ms. Eslami joined the Unemployed High School
    Graduates Movement* after obtaining her high school diploma in Abadan.
    This Movement was a part of an extensive civil effort by unemployed
    individuals to secure the right to employment and to government support
    for the unemployed, which had started around February-March 1979.
    (Boroumand Center interview, May 3, 2022; Andisheh va Peykar website, May
    4, 2022). With the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war, Ms. Eslami subsequently
    moved to Tehran with her family. One of Ms. Eslami s brothers was killed
    in the war. Ms. Eslami worked at a soap production factory for a while,
    and was subsequently employed at the Starlight sock-making factory.
    (Boroumand Center interview, May 3, 2022; Andisheh va Peykar website, May
    4, 2022). Ms. Eslami was a Marxist and a member of the Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class. She was an avid reader and was
    very sociable. (Boroumand Center interview, May 3, 2022; Andisheh va
    Peykar website, May 4, 2022). The Peykar Organization for the Liberation
    of the Working Class The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social
    imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention Ms.
    Eslami was arrested on February 8, 1982, in Tehran by members of the
    [Revolutionary] Comite and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
    (Boroumand Center interview, December 12, 2021, and May 3, 2022).
    According to official published reports, 23 places where the Peykar
    Organization s members and supporters had been hiding were attacked and
    more than 40 of the Organization s members were arrested, including its
    central leadership. (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, February 13, 1982). Ms.
    Eslami was detained at Tehran s Evin Prison and was deprived of
    visitations. (Boroumand Center interview, May 3, 2022). Trial There is no
    information regarding Ms. Eslami s trial session(s). She was not, however,
    represented by an attorney. Charges Ms. Eslami s charges were stated to
    have been membership in the Peykar Organization, and Moharebeh ( waging
    war against Allah ). (Boroumand Center interview, May 3, 2022). Ms. Eslami
    was arrested in the course of the widespread arrest of Peykar Organization
    members, and was executed three months later. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No
