    Information regarding the execution of Mr. Ahmad Tahmasebi Alijanvand was
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation via an electronic form by a person
    familiar with his case. According to this information, Mr. Tahmasebi
    Alijanvand, son of Mohammad, was born in Masjed Soleiman in 1959. He was a
    high school graduate, single, and a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Minority. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin
    America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic
    Republic and was active mainly in the political arena and the labor
    movement. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on Mr.
    Tahmasebi Alijanvand’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is
    available on the accused’s trial. Charges No information is available on
    the charges against the accused. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against Mr. Tahmasebi Alijanvand cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of Mr. Tahmasebi Alijanvand’s execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against him. Defence No
    information is available on the accused’s defense. Judgment According to
    the electronic form report, Mr. Tahmasebi Alijanvand was executed by a
    firing squad in Ahvaz in October or November of 1982.
