    The information about Ms. Farkhondeh Mohammadtaqi is drawn from an
    interview with a person familiar with this case. She was born in Tehran in
    1963. She was a high school student and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. According to those close to her, she was very quiet
    and kind. Her brother, Reza Keivanzad, was also executed in 1985. Arrest
    and detention Ms. Farkhondeh Mohammadtaqi was arrested in September 1981
    by Revolutionary Guards who were wearing plain clothes inside her father’s
    home. The Guards said that they were taking her only to ask a few
    questions. She was detained at Evin Prison, Section 209. The interviewee
    quotes Ms. Mohammadtaqi’s cellmates that she was severely tortured. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No
    information is available on Ms. Farkhondeh Mohammadtaqi’s charges.
    According to the interviewee, the religious judge told her that she was
    “obstinate, stubborn, and a believer in Mojahedin.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available about her defense. Judgment
    Ms. Farkhondeh Mohammadtaqi was executed by a firing squad in January
    1982. According to the interviewee, the officials did not inform her
    family of her execution. About three months later, officials called her
    family and told them to go to Behesht-e Zahra Cemetery (in Tehran) and ask
    for her burial place. Her burial place was number 76, row 36 in section
    92.
