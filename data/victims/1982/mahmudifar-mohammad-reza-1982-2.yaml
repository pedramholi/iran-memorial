    Mr. Mohammad Reza Mahmudifar is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The information about Mr. Mohammad
    Reza Mahmudifar was drawn from the website of the People's Mojahedin of
    Iran Organization (PMIO). He was born in Shahr-e Rey and studied at Alborz
    High School. As a high school student first joined the MKO sympathizers,
    then the MKO militia. He distributed MKO publications and printed posters
    for them. During the speech of Masud Rajavi (the head of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization) on June 12, 1980 in Amjadieh (sports stadium in
    Tehran), he was a guard and his skull was fractured in clashes with
    government agents. On July 21, 1981 the agents ambushed his home and since
    nobody was home, the belongings in the house were confiscated. After this
    incident, he went underground. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention According to the
    MKO website, the family of Mr. Mohammad Reza Mahmudifar had no news of him
    for months. For six months they searched for him, without success, in all
    the prisons in both Karaj and Tehran. Finally, in February 1982, Mohammad
    Reza called his family from Evin Prison and told them they could visit.
    When his mother saw him for the first time, he was so thin and
    hunched-back that she did not recognize him. The family had only two other
    visits with him before he was executed. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr.
    Mohammad Reza Mahmudifar s charges. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available about his defense. Judgment Mr. Mohammad Reza
    Mahmudifar was condemned to death and executed by a firing squad on May
    15, 1982. _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arr
