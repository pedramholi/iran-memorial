    Ms. Ma'sumeh Qajar Azdanlu is one of the 1,533 executed prisoners listed
    by the Association of Iranian Women of Köln (Germany). The list published
    on September 10, 1997, and is entitled: "A Partial List of Women Executed
    by the Islamic Republic of Iran.” This list has been updated by former
    political prisoners living in various countries. This execution was also
    reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) in 1985. The list includes 12028
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Additional information
    about Ms. Qajar Azdanlu is taken from the MKO website. She was born in
    Tehran, was an industrial engineering student in the Tehran College of
    Science and Technology (Elmosan'at) and an MKO sympathizer. She was active
    in the student sections of the organization and after the June 20, 1981
    demonstrations, she was in charge of carrying out sensitive missions. The
    demonstration of June 20, 1981, was a protest against the parliament's
    impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic's systematic
    policy of excluding the MKO from the country's political scene, the
    Ayatollah Khomeini’s refusal to meet with MKO leaders and his insistence
    to disarm them. Until that day, the MKO had supported the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function within the framework of the new
    political system. On June 20, 1981, the MKO officially changed its policy
    and tried to overthrow the regime by organizing mass demonstrations
    throughout the country. These demonstrations, which were severely
    suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of demonstrators, were
    followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by the Revolutionary
    Guards and paramilitary forces that targeted not only the MKO, but all
    other opposition groups. The massive repression, unprecedented in the
    history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized the policy the months-old
    state harassment and suppression of dissidents and resulted in the banning
    of all forms of independent political dissent. Arrest and detention There
    is no specific information on the defendant’s detention. According to the
    MKO website, on April 2, 1982, the Revolutionary Guards attacked the
    residence of Ms. Qajar Azdanlu and her husband, Mas’ud Izadkhah. Her
    husband was killed and she was shot in the jaw and the arm. She was
    unconscious when the Revolutionary Guards arrested her. During her six
    months detention in the Evin prison, she was tortured severely. This site
    quotes one of her cellmates saying: "Due to the torture, she miscarried
    her baby and was not able to walk. Since they did not treat her jaw; she
    had hard time talking and eating. They didn't give her any pain killers so
    she was very weak and in constant pain." Trial No information is available
    on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on Ms. Qajar
    Azdanlu’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains
    no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
