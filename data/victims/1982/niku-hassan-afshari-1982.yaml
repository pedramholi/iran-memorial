    Information about Mr. Hassan Afshari Niku has been taken from an
    electronic form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case who
    was a wife’s cellmate. Mr. Afshari Niku began his political activism when
    he enrolled at the Sharif University of Technology before the 1979
    Revolution. He opposed the monarchy and joined the Rah-e Kargar
    organization. First he was active in the labor section and later in
    students’ section of the Organization. Some time before his arrest, he
    left the Organization due to disagreement with its policies; and he was no
    longer politically active. “Rah-e Kargar” or the “Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran” was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They
    identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini’s leadership. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Afshari Niku was arrested in the winter of 1982, along with his wife, and
    taken to Evin prison. The details of his arrest and detention are not
    known. He was kept incommunicado and was denied the right to be
    represented by an attorney. Trial There is no information regarding this
    trial. Charges The charges brought against the defendant are not known.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence
    presented against the accused. Defense No information is available
    concerning Mr. Afshari Niku’s defense. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the verdict leading to this execution. Mr. Hassan Afshari
    Niku was executed in Evin prison in the summer of 1982.
