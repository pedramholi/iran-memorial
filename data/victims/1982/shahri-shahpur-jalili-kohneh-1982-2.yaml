    After finishing high school, and with the universities closed for the
    Cultural Revolution, Shahpur and a cousin moved to Tabriz, against parents
    wishes, to study Marx and learn lathe work. Information about Mr. Shahpur
    Jalili Kohneh Shahri, son of Jalil, was drawn from an interview with his
    brother. On June 16, 1982, the Kayhan newspaper announced his execution.
    He is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No. 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Jalili
    Kohneh Shahri was born on December 2, 1963, in Kohneh Shahr (near Salmas,
    in the north-western province of West Azarbaijan, in Iran). Influenced by
    politically active relatives, he began political activism as a sympathizer
    of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, Minority Faction. His activities
    consisted of reading articles and books on Marxism. When Mr. Jalili Kohneh
    Shahri graduated from high school, he could not enroll in college because
    all universities were closed during the Cultural Revolution, which aimed
    to Islamicize the curricula as well as purge counter-revolutionary
    professors and students. Continuing his education was not an option at the
    time. As such, Mr. Jalili Kohneh Shahri and his cousin moved from Salmas
    to Tabriz in July 1981 to learn to operate a lathe. According to
    information that his family found out later, the house where the two
    cousins lived was previously used as a safe-house by sympathizers of the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization and it was under surveillance by state agents.
    Three months after they moved to Tabriz, they were both arrested. Mr.
    Jalili Kohneh Shahri s brother remembers, Shahpur always helped my father.
    He was on good terms with everybody. His friend loved him a lot. He was
    positive and energetic. He was an innocent young man and very intelligent
    with his studies. His family was proud of him. His cousin, Mr. Gholam
    Jalili Kohneh Shahri, a member of the Peykar Organization, was executed in
    Tehran s Evin Prison in 1984. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly in the
    political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention On November
    9, 1981, a few armed Revolutionary Guards came to Mr. Jalili Kohneh Shahri
    s house in the Sarcheshmeh neighborhood in Tabriz. The guards searched the
    house and arrested him and his cousin. Shahpur was 17 at the time of
    arrest. State agents did not inform the family of Mr. Jalili Kohneh Shahri
    s arrest. His sister went to his house and told their parents that she was
    unable to locate him. The neighbors told her that two or three persons had
    been arrested. She then went to Tabriz Prison to see whether he was held
    there but the prison officials did not respond to her questions. After
    this incident, their mother started making daily trips from Salmas to
    Tabriz and visited different authorities offices in an attempt to locate
    her son. Among others, she visited the headquarters of the Revolutionary
    Guards, police stations, headquarters of Basij para-military force, and
    Tabriz Prison. Officials refused to give her any news about Mr. Jalili
    Kohneh Shahri. About one month after hisarrest, Tabriz Prison officials
    informed the family that he was incarcerated in Tabriz prison.
    Approximately three months after his arrest, Mr. Jalili Kohneh Shahri was
    allowed to visit his mother in prison. She could not recognize her son. He
    could not open his eyes because he had been held in a dark solitary cell
    for two weeks prior to the visit. He had lost weight, was wearing dirty
    clothes, and a long beard and hair. He was not allowed to shower while
    kept in solitary confinement. After the first visit, Mr. Jalili Kohneh
    Shahri s mother started to bring clean clothes for him and took his dirty
    clothes so that she could take them home and wash them. Once she found a
    small piece of paper in his clothes, on which he had written short notes.
    He declared that it was very unlikely for him to be released from prison.
    Using code words, he also asked his family to inform some friends that
    they were about to be arrested and that they should flee Salmas. Mr.
    Jalili Kohneh Shahri s parents met an individual who claimed he knew a
    cleric and that he could bribe the cleric so that Mr. Jalili Kohneh Shahri
    s sentence would be reduced. When Mr. Jalili Kohneh Shahri s mother
    visited him in prison, she told him not to worry and that she had found
    someone who co
