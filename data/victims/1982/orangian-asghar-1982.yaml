    The execution of Mr. Akbar Orangian, along with twenty others, was
    announced by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotic section of the
    Islamic Republic Public Prosecution Office and reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on March 3, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Orangian was an international drug trafficker and a repeat drug
    offender charged with providing and distributing narcotics among the
    youth, possession of 117 gm of pure heroin and a scale for weighing
    heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against defendants
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Gholam Ali s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Section
    of the Public Prosecutor s Office sentenced Mr. Gholam Ali to death.
    Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was
    carried out.
