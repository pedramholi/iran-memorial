    Ms. Edna Sabet is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the
    list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. Further information was sent through an electronic
    form by a person close to her to the Omid site. She is also one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Book of
    Prisons, Volume 2 edited by Naser Mohajer, refers to Ms. Sabet as well.
    Ms. Sabet was born in Tehran on June 24, 1955. She was a mechanical
    engineering student at the Ariyamehr Technical University in Tehran. She
    joined the Peykar Organization and became a member of the Tehran Committee
    of the Peykar Organization and led the Worker s Section of the
    organization. She was married to Mr. Gholam Hossein Salim Aruni, another
    Peykar activist, who was executed in Tehran in 1981. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention According to the electronic form, Ms. Edna Sabet was
    arrested in February of 1982 and detained in Tohid Prison. She was
    tortured in the prison. Trial No information is available on the defendant
    s trial. Charges No information is available on Ms. Sabet's charges.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Sabet's defense. Judgment According to
    the Mojahed magazine, Ms. Sabet was executed in Tehran on February 12,
    1982.
