    Ms. Shiva Mahmudi Asadollahzadeh (Also spelled "Asadu'llah-Zadeh") is one
    of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report documents the persecution of the
    members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is
    killed since 1978. Additional information has been drawn from various
    issues of the The Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986,
    Haifa 1994. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    Baha i religious community is the largest minority group in Iran, with
    approximately 300,000 members in 1979 (more current figures are not
    available).* The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected Baha
    is religious to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of
    their most fundamental human rights. The Baha i religion is not recognized
    under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities
    refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha is have been denied the
    rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot
    profess and practice their faith and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence. ** Arrest and detention No information is available on the
    circumstances of this defendant's arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on Ms. Asadollahzadeh's trial. Charges The
    charges against Ms. Asadollahzadeh are not known. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Ms. Asadollahzadeh's defense.
    However, the representatives of the Baha'i community stress that their
    members are being persecuted for their religious beliefs. They note that
    Baha'is' requests to access their files are usually denied, and access to
    attorneys is often denied. They refute the validity of charges such as
    counter-revolutionary political activities or spying leveled against them
    in Iranian courts. They point out that the fundamental principles of their
    religion require them to show loyalty and obedience to their government
    and refrain from any political involvement. They believe that the
    accusation of espionage for Israel is unfounded and based solely on the
    fact that the Baha'i World Centre is in Israel. They point out that this
    centre was established on Mount Carmel in the late 19th century, long
    before the establishment of the State of Israel. Judgment This defendant
    was sentenced to death and executed. Baha'is have reported to human rights
    organizations that the text of sentences is often not communicated to
    them. ----------------------------------- * Slow Death for Iran s Baha is
    by Richard N. Ostling, Time Magazine,20 February 1984. Also see The
    Persecution of the Baha is of Iran, 1844-1984, by Douglas Martin, Baha i
    Studies,volume 12/13, 1984, p. 3. There is no information about the
    current number of Baha is in Iran. ** The Islamic Republic Penal Code
    grants no rights to Baha is, and the courts have denied them the right to
    redress or to protection against assault, murder, and other forms of
    persecution and abuse. In so doing, the courts have treated Baha is as
    unprotected citizens or apostates, citing eminent religious authorities
    whose edicts are considered a source of law equal to acts of Parliament.
    The Founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, made execution a
    punishment for the crime of apostasy and decreed that a Muslim would not
    be punished for killing an apostate. Banishment from public functions has
    seriously damaged the Baha is professional, economic, and social lives.
    Soon after the revolution, a Ministry of Labor directive called for the
    dismissal from public office and all governmental organizations and
    associations of those who belong to any of the misguided sects recognized
    by all Muslims as heretical deviations from Islam, or to organizations
    whose doctrine and constitution are based on rejection of the
    divinely-revealed religions. Finally, the mandatory requirement of
    specifying religion in application forms and official documents (lifted
    recently in some areas under international pressure) has seriously limited
    Baha is freedoms and opportunities in all areas of their lives including
    divorce, inheritance, access to universities and travel. In practice,
    since 1980, thousands of Baha is have lost their jobs, pensions,
    businesses, properties and educational opportunities. By banning the Baha
    i administration including Spiritual Assemblies - the elected bodies that
    lead and administer the affairs of Baha i communities at both local and
    national levels - the Islamic Republic has denied Baha is the right to
    meet, elect, and operate their religious institutions. Further, the
    Iranian government has executed at least 200 Baha is and has imprisoned,
    tortured, and pressured to convert to Islam scores more. Because of the
    unanimous international condemnation of the persecution of this quiet
