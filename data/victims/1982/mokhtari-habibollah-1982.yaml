    The execution of Mr. Habibollah Mokhtari, along with ten others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on December 22, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Mokhtari
    was reported to be charged with selling 130 gm of heroin, organizing a
    drug trafficking gang and pleading guilty for having concealed 150 gm of
    heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Mokhtari's defense. Judgment The
    Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran sentenced Mr.
    Mokhtari to death. The sentence was carried out.
