    The information about Ms. Roya Dastmalchi is based on an interview with a
    person close to her. She is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Ms. Dastmalchi was born in Tehran.
    She began her political activities during the revolution and became a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In 1981, she became
    a leader among the students in eastern Tehran and went underground, after
    the demonstration of June 20, 1981. She was executed by firing squad along
    with 56 others. According to the interviewee, Ms. Roya Dastmalchi was not
    left alone after her death. From 1982 to 1984, her tombstone was broken
    four times, government agents bothered her parents several times and
    entered their house yard during the night. Her mother was prevented from
    exiting the country for a long time. The demonstration on June 20, 1981,
    took place in protest against the parliament's impeachment of President
    Banisadr and the Islamic Republic's systematic policy of excluding the MKO
    from the country's political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to
    meet with MKO leaders and his insistence for them to disarm. The MKO had
    until then supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to
    function within the framework of the new political system. On June 20th,
    the Organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations, in which some of the
    demonstrators were armed, all over the country. These demonstrations,
    which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of
    participants, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that targeted not only
    the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized as
    official government policy the months-old state harassment and suppression
    of dissidents, and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Arrest and detention According to the interviewee, Ms.
    Roya Dastmalchi was arrested in a house in eastern Tehran in late 1981.
    She was transferred to Evin prison. She had some visitations with her
    family, but the dates and number of these visitations is unknown. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. According to the
    interviewee, the trial took place in Evin prison in July, 1982. Charges No
    information is available on Ms. Roya Dastmalchi’s charges. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available about her defense. Judgment The court condemned Ms. Roya
    Dastmalchi to death. She was executed by firing squad in Evin prison on
    July 18, 1982. The officials did not inform her family of her execution.
    According to the interviewee, a night before the weekly visitation, her
    family received a phone call from the Evin prison and the caller told
    them: "Do not go to visit her tomorrow. Go to the Behesht-e Zahra
    cemetery. Your daughter is there." Then, the caller hung up. The family
    was able to find her grave location through an acquaintance.
