    Mr. Hassan Ajam is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Additional information has been drawn from an electronic form
    sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. According to the
    form he was a affiliated with a communist party and an engineer graduate
    from the Iran University of Science and Technology. The Mojahed Magazine
    mentioned him as a student and sympathizer of the Razmandegan
    Organization. The Razmandegan Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded in the winter of 1979. Its activities were
    focused on the working class and factories. The founding tenets of
    Razmandegan included the rejection of armed struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. It viewed the
    Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state and believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles. Razmandegan was among the
    groups that became known as Khat-e Se (Third line). By early 1981,
    disagreements on the Party s position on the Iran-Iraq war caused internal
    splits in Razmandegan. These splits, which coincided with the massive and
    brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian government, caused the
    Organization to disband. Arrest and detention The exact circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. According to the
    form, he was arrested in September 1981. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant s trial. Charges No information is available regarding
    the charges brought against Mr. Ajam. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ajam s
    defense. Judgment No information is available on the verdict leading to
    this execution. Mr. Hassan Ajam was executed by a firing squad in Tehran
    on January 02, 1982.
