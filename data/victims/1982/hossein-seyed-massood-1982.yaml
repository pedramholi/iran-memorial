    The execution of Mr. Seyed Massood Hossein was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on October 12, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Hossein was
    reported to be charged with "sodomizing a child." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant but specifies that he confessed to
    the above mentioned crime. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Hossein's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Bushehr
    sentenced Mr. Hossein to death. The sentence was confirmed by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Qom. He was executed at the Friday sermon s site
    in front of the Hezbollah Ummah who were shouting these slogans: Allahu
    Akbar (God is great) and death to America.
