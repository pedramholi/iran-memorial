    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Ali Sadeqian, along with another person, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 18, 1982. The Baha is in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention No information is
    available on the circumstances of this defendant's arrest and detention.
    Trial There is no specific information on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Sadeqian was a member of the Baha'i
    community in Shiraz as well as a spy for Israel . Evidence of guilt No
    information is available on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Sadeqian's defense. However,
    the representatives of the Baha'i community stress that their members are
    being persecuted for their religious beliefs. They note that Baha'is
    requests to access their files is usually denied, and that even though
    they are allowed to avail themselves of the services of a defense counsel
    since the mid-1990s, attorneys are often under pressure not to accept
    Baha'i clients. They refute the validity of charges such as
    counter-revolutionary political activities or spying leveled against them
    in Iranian courts. They point out that the fundamental principles of their
    religion require them to show loyalty and obedience to their government
    and refrain from any political involvement. They believe that the
    accusation of espionage for Israel is unfounded and based solely on the
    fact that the Baha'i World Centre is in Israel. They point out that this
    centre was established on Mount Carmel in the late 19th century, long
    before the establishment of the State of Israel. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz sentenced Mr. Sadeqian to death. The
    sentence was carried out at night. ---------------------------- 1- Slow
    Death for Iran s Baha is by Richard N. Ostling, Time Magazine,20 February
    1984. Also see The Persecution of the Baha is of Iran, 1844-1984, by
    Douglas Martin, Baha i Studies,volume 12/13, 1984, p. 3. There is no
    information about the current number of Baha is in Iran. 2- The Islamic
    Republic Penal Code grants no rights to Baha'is, and the courts have
    denied them the right to redress or to protection against assault, murder,
    and other forms of persecution and abuse. In so doing, the courts have
    treated Baha'is as unprotected citizens or "apostates," citing eminent
    religious authorities whose edicts are considered to be a source of law
    equal to acts of Parliament. The Founder of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, made execution a punishment for the crime of apostasy
    and decreed that a Muslim would not be punished for killing an apostate.
