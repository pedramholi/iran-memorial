    The execution of Mr. Ali Qasemzadeh Purmotlaq, along with ten others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on December 22, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Qasemzadeh
    Purmotlaq was reported to be charged with drug dealing, being convicted 13
    times as a drug dealer and exhorting the youth to drug addiction. He was
    imprisoned during the revolution but was pardoned and freed yet did not
    stop his criminal acts and started to supply and sell heroin again. The
    last time he was arrested he possessed 30 packages of heroin, concealed in
    a jar in his house that he was about to sell. Also, he pleaded guilty to
    heroin dealing. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Qasemzadeh Purmotlaq s defense.
    Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran
    sentenced Mr. Qasemzadeh Purmotlaq to death. The sentence was carried out.
