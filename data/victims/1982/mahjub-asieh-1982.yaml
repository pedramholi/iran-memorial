    The execution of Ms. Asieh Mahjub, along with another person, was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on Jan 19, 1982. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Ms.
    Mahjub was charged with adultery. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms.
    Mahjub's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Some
    e-sara sentenced Ms. Mahjub to death. The sentence was confirmed by the
    Supreme Judiciary Council. It was carried out.
