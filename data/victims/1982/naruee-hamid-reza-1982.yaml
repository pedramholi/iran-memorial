    The execution of Mr. Hamid Reza Naruee was published in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on January 23, 1980. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Naruee was charged with
    transportation and possession of 44 kg of opium. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Naruee's
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Torbat-Heydarieh
    sentenced Mr. Naruee to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme
    Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out.
