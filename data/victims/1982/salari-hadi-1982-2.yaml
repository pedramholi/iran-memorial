    Mr. Hadi Salari is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Additional information about him has been obtained from an
    interview given to Boroumand Foundation by an individual close to him. Mr.
    Salari was single and he was studying nuclear physics at Urmia University.
    He had been admitted to university at 1979 and was among the seven-member
    Urmia University student council. The person interviewed described Mr.
    Salari as a disciplined, hardworking and persistent individual who was
    successful in his studies and had a healthy and organized life. He was
    athletic, well-dressed, and popular among his friends. Mr. Salari, who was
    the only religious person in his family, left his family in 1979 and
    started his political activity in Ardabil, where he joined the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. He lived in an MKO safe house. According to the
    testimony of a person close to him, he was active in the armed wing of the
    organization but was not armed himself. Based on the available
    information, Mr. Salari was arrested for the first time in 1980 after
    being involved in a physical altercation with Hojjatoleslam Gholam Reza
    Hasani, the Urmia Friday Prayer leader. After his arrest he was
    transferred to the Tabriz prison. He was released after his brother gave a
    pledge and Mr. Salari promised not to engage in political activity. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention Mr. Salari was arrested between August 31
    and September 2, 1981 in Ardabil. He was going to a public bathhouse when
    he was deemed suspicious by a Revolutionary Guard patrol. When he was
    arrested, he told the Revolutionary Guards that he was not involved in
    politics, and he gave them the address of his paternal home in Nurabad, in
    the vicinity of Shiraz. After his arrest Mr. Hadi Salari spent about four
    months in Ardabil prison. Once his involvement with the MKO was known,
    however, he was transferred to a prison run by the Revolutionary Guard.
    Mr. Salari s father, who was informed by MKO supporters of his son s
    arrest, went to Ardabil in order to make a pledge and secure the release
    of his son. Although Mr. Salari did not have the right to have visitors,
    Mojahedin supporters who worked at the prison transferred him to the
    prison medical clinic, where he met his father and brother. Mr. Salari
    informed them that his interrogators were not aware of his activities, and
    that they did not have any evidence they could use to convict him. He
    asked his father to go to the prosecutor s office and say that his son is
    not involved in any political activity. His father went to the prosecutor
    s office and requested his son s release. The prosecutor told him that he
    should provide a letter by Nurabad Revolutionary Guards stating that his
    son does not engage in any political activity. In that letter, which Mr.
    Salari s family never gave to the prosecutor, the Nurabad Revolutionary
    Guard office wrote that Mr. Salari had deviated from the path of the
    Revolution, and it recommended his execution. During the last visit, which
    took place on December 31, 1981, Mr. Salari confirmed to his father that
