    News of the execution of Mr. Asghar Araqchian, along with four others, was
    reported in a communiqu from the public relations office of the Islamic
    Revolution s Chief Public Prosecutor, quoted in the Jomhuri Eslami daily
    newspaper on January 23, 1982. Additional information about Mr. Asghar
    Araqchian is based on an electronic form sent to Omid by a person familiar
    with this case. According to the existing information, he was born in
    Hamadan. He was single, 24, a student, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. He is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No. 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded
    in 1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary, and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to
    recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution
    and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic s leaders.* Arrest and Detention According
    to the information sent to Omid, Mr. Asghar Araqchian was betrayed by his
    brother, who was a Revolutionary Committee member, and was arrested in
    Hamadan. There are no further details available on his arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on Mr. Araqchian s trial.
    Charges According to the newspaper report, Mr. Araqchian was charged with
    participation in conspiracy and armed insurrection against the Islamic
    government, being highly active in the safe house as well as living there,
    supporting the hypocrites (term used for the Mojahedin-e Khalq
    Organization or MKO by the Islamic Republic authorities) positions, being
    responsible for the distribution of the illegal publications which had
    influenced a significant number of people. Evidence of Guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against Mr. Araqchian. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Araqchian s defense. Judgment According to the information sent to Omid,
    Mr. Asghar Araqchian was the first person executed at the central square
    in Hamadan after the revolution. According to the newspaper report, The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Hamadan identified Mr. Araqchian and
    four others as Mofsed (corruptors on earth) and Baghi (rebels against the
    Islamic regime) and condemned them to death. The sentence was carried out
    on January 19, 1982. According to Mojahed magazine, he was executed by
    firing squad. _________________________ * The exclusion of MKO members
    from government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing
    houses, in conjunction with the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretations of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as hypocrites, and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown, but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the fol
