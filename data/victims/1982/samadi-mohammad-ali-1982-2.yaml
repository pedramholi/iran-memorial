    Mr. Mohammad Ali Samadi, a member of the Peykar Organization, is one of
    the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Additional information
    about Mr. Samadi’s execution was gathered through an interview in April
    2006 with a person familiar with the case. Furthermore, his memoir and
    will is published in the book titled The Prison Book , second volume,
    edited by Naser Mohajer. Mr. Samadi was born in August of 1952 in the city
    of Gonabad. He attended Tehran University from which he received his
    masters in chemical engineering. In 1976, he left for Britain to obtain
    his PhD, where he became politically activities against the Shah’s regime.
    Mr. Samadi returned to Iran before the 1979 Revolution, cut contact with
    his family for a while, becoming an underground revolutionary. He became
    one of the main organizers of the group known as “Revolutionaries for the
    Freedom of the Working Class” which later on joined the Peykar
    Organization. He was active in leading the Educational Section within the
    Organization, and due to his apt writing skills became an editor of
    Peykar’s main publications, titled Peykar weekly, and Peykar Theoratical .
    Around 1981, during the schism within the Peykar Organization, he was one
    of the three leaders of the Revolutionary Faction of the Organization. He
    is remembered for his strong sense of responsibility, humbleness and his
    devotion to his political ideas. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Samadi was arrested in February 1982. According to the interviewee, at
    the time, the authorities arrested many leftist activists in the streets
    solely based on certain features such as a mustache, eyeglasses, or
    clothing. Based on an eyewitness account, Mr. Samadi was arrested at the
    Enqelab Square in Tehran, while hailing a taxi. He was wearing eyeglasses
    and upon arrest the authorities found Peykar’s literature and pamphlets on
    him. Mr. Samadi was detained at the Evin Prison for about 5 months before
    his execution. The Revolutionary Guards searched his parent’s house and
    took some books and tapes, but did not disclose the location of his
    detention until a month after his arrest. He was able to contact his
    family a few days after his arrest, but did not know where he was
    detained. He called them several times, but refused to answer their
    questions. For a while, he was able to hide his membership with the
    Organization. Those close to him believe that Mr. Samadi’s leadership
    position in the Organization was revealed to prison authorities by another
    one of the Peykar’s leaders, who had also been arrested. Mr. Samadi was
    allowed visitation with his family during his detention. The visits, which
    occurred monthly, were 10-15 minutes long and he communicated with his
    family through phones placed at each side of a glass divider. According to
    the interviewee, he had grown a beard and was in high spirits, until the
    last visit in which his beard was shaved. He was not allowed legal
    representation while in prison. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges It is not clear what Mr. Samadi was charged
    with, but based on the interview, he was executed after the authorities
    reportedly learned of his active membership in the Peykar Organization.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Samadi’s defense. Judgment According to
    the interviewee, Mr. Samadi, along with about a hundred others, was
    executed by a firing squad at the Evin Prison on July 18, 1982. The
    authorities buried his body at the Behesht-e Zahra Cemetery. The
    authorities did not inform Mr. Samadi’s family of his execution and when
    his family went to the Prison to visit him, they refused to call him up
    for visitation and evaded their questions saying that he had been trans
