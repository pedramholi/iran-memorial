    The news of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Anvar Nikray, along with
    seventeen others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on September
    18, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Nikray and
    other defendants were collectively charged with “collaboration with the
    counter-revolutionary grouplets who are enemies of God, activities against
    the Islamic Republic, attacking the fellow members of the police and
    military forces, trading weapons, extortion, committing the hideous act of
    sodomy, drug dealing and having relations with the members of the infidel
    Baas party.” There is no mention of the specific charges against the
    defendant. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Nikray’s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sanandaj declared
    Mr. Nikray an enemy of God and a corruptor and sentenced him to death. The
    sentence was carried out.
