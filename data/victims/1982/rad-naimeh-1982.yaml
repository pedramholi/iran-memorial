    The information about Ms. Na’imeh Rad has been drawn from an interview
    with a relative. She is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. In her childhood, Ms. Rad was a happy, mischievous,
    and very smart child. Since then she was interested in medicine and would
    visit the hospital, where her mother worked as a nurse. She helped the
    nurses in the hospital and had gone to the operation room to observe the
    surgery before even admitted to medical school. In university, she would
    repeat her lessons to other after the class. Before the 1979 Revolution,
    she became interested in the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and met Mohammad
    Qobadpur, whom she married in 1981. They went underground the same year.
    Her husband died in street armed clashes. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Ms. Rad’s arrest and detention are not known. She wrote
    letter to her mother even when she lived underground. When her mother
    stopped receiving letter, she feared that Ms. Rad might have been
    arrested. The authorities never officially announced her arrest to her
    family, but they believe that she was arrested in 1982 in Mashad. Ms. Rad
    was held incommunicado during her detention. Trial There is no information
    regarding this trial. Charges The charges brought against the defendant
    are not known. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning
    the evidence presented against the accused. Defense No information is
    available concerning Ms. Rad’s defense. Judgment No specific information
    is available about the verdict leading to this execution. Ms. Na’imeh Rad
    was shot by a firing squad in Mashad in August/September 1982 ( Mojahed
    magazine). The authorities never announced her execution to her family.
    When Ms. Rad’s mother stopped receiving her letters, she started listening
    to Mojahedin Khalq Organization’s radio broadcasting from Iraq to maybe
    learn about Ms. Rad’s whereabouts. This radio announced her name among
    other executed individuals in Mashad in 1982. Ms. Rad’s mother and brother
    went to Mashad’s revolutionary guards’ building. They were given a sealed
    envelope and told to go to the courthouse of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court. There, they found out that the letter inside the sealed envelope
    said that Ms. Rad was executed. But the authorities refused to tell them
    where her body was buried. Her mother and brother then went to the
    cemetery, to the section where the executed persons were buried. After a
    verbal fight with the cemetery guard, they forced him to look into the
    registry and show them Ms. Rad’s burial location.
