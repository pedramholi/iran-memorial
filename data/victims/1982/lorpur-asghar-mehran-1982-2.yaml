    Mr. Lorpur was an agricultural engineer. He had started his political
    activities when he was a student, during the reign of Mohammad Reza
    Pahlavi. News of the execution of Mr. Asghar (Mehran) Lorpur, son of Ali,
    was electronically transmitted to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center by an
    acquaintance of his (May 23, 2022). Additional information was collected
    from Jomhuri Eslami newspaper (March 17 18, 1982). Mr. Asghar (Mehran)
    Lorpur was born in Zarqan, Fars Province, on September 2, 1955. His father
    was a farmer and they were a religious family. He had an agricultural
    engineering degree from Pahlavi University in Shiraz. Mr. Lorpur started
    his political activities when he was a student, and that was the reason he
    missed two semesters at university. During the January 1979 revolution, he
    was politically active in Shiraz and in Zarqan. After the 1979 revolution,
    Mr. Lorpur turned down different job offers. He said he only wanted to
    help the people . During the late 1970s, after he completed his military
    service, he was recruited by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. In May
    1981, when Mr. Lorpur was newly married, he and his wife were forced to
    live in hiding because of his political activities (Electronic
    communication, May 23, 2022). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention On March 16, 1982,
    at 11 pm, there was an armed altercation in a house in Gowdgari
    neighborhood, near Qasr al-Dasht Street and Asyab Ghavami Street. During
    this incident Mr. Lorpur was injured in the right leg and he and several
    other people were arrested by the Islamic Republic Revolutionary Guard
    Corps (Electronic communication, May 23, 2022; Jomhuri Eslami newspaper,
    March 18, 1982). According to the official media, this altercation had
    started at about 8 pm (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, March 18, 1982). Mr.
    Lorpur s acquaintance said that this altercation lasted about 6 hours
    (Electronic communication, May 23, 2022). Mr. Lorpur was detained for
    about 3 weeks in the solitary wing of the Islamic Republic Revolutionary
    Guards Detention Center in Shiraz, and then he was moved to the general
    section. During this time, he was able to meet with his wife, who was also
    being held at the same detention center, and with his family. Mr. Lorpur
    met with his wife for the last time at this detention center on June 2,
    1982 (Electronic communication, May 23, 2022). There is no information
    regarding the circumstances of Mr. Lorpur s interrogation or of his
    detention. He did not have access to an attorney at the time of
    interrogation. Trial During April 1982, Mr. Lorpur and another person who
    had a similar situation were tried at the Islamic Republic Revolutionary
    Guard Detention Center in Shiraz. The trial lasted less than 30 minutes
    (Electronic communication, May 23, 2022). Mr. Lorpur had no access to an
    attorney. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Lorpur was cooperation
    with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and armed resistance (Electronic
    communication, May 23, 2022). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethni
