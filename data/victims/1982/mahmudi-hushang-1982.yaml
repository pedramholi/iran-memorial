    The execution of Mr. Hushang Mahmudi, along with twenty others, was
    announced by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotic section of the
    Islamic Republic Public Prosecution Office and reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on March 3, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Mahmudi was charged with possessing 101 gm of heroin and having been
    convicted 12 times. He also had a record for other offences. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mahmudi
    s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s
    Office sentenced Mr. Mahmudi to death. Having been confirmed by the
    Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out.
