    The execution of Mr. Akhtarjan Abdanabi, along with twenty others, was
    announced by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotic section of the
    Islamic Republic Public Prosecution Office and reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on March 3, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Abdanabi was charged with being consistently involved in the sale of
    narcotics and possessing 513 gm of heroin which was concealed skillfully
    the last time he was arrested. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Abdanabi
    s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s
    Office sentenced Mr. Abdanabi to death. Having been confirmed by the
    Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out.
