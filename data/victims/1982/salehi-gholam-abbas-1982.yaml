    governmental institutions were foremost on the organization’s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the
    closure of their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the
    Islamic Republic authorities’ different interpretation of Islam, widened
    the gap between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the
    Mojahedin as “Hypocrites” and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime
    attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and
    while distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO
    supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration
    protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the government
    officials’ efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr.
    Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration illegal,
    thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary
    Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from
    this demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were
    arrested and executed in the following days and weeks. The day after the
    demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a repressive campaign –
    unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and
    sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO
    announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and assassinated
    a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the Islamic regime. *
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charge brought against the defendant is not known. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Salehi’s defense. Judgment There is no information on the
    verdict leading to this execution. *In the summer of 1981, the leader of
    the MKO and the impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in
    France, where they founded the National Council of Resistance. After the
    MKO leaders and many of its members were expelled from France, they went
    to Iraq and founded the National Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which
    entered Iranian territory a few times during the Iran-Iraq war. They were
    defeated in July 1988 during their last operation, the Forugh Javidan
    Operation. A few days after this operation, thousands of imprisoned
    Mojahedin supporters were killed during the mass executions of political
    prisoners in 1988. Ever since the summer of 1981, the MKO has continued
    its activities outside of Iran. No information is available regarding
    members and activities of the MKO inside the country. In defense: In spite
    of the “armed struggle” announcement by the MKO on June 20, 1981, many
    sympathizers of the organization had no military training, were not armed,
    and did not participate in armed conflict. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
