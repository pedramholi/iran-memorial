    Mr. Mohammad Gol Rigi is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on
    the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. He is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Rigi was a student at Sistan and
    Baluchestan University. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    details of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. According
    to one of his cellmates, Mr. Rigi attempted to escape from the Zahedan
    Prison. He was shot at the second attempt. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on
    Mr. Rigi’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rigi’s defense.
    Judgment Based on a witness’s testimony, Mr. Rigi was shot during his
    second escape attempt from the Zahedan Prison in April of 1982. The
    officials took him back to the prison where he died under torture the same
    night (Andeesheh va Peykar). The next day, prison officials showed his
    body to other prisoners and announced that he was killed during his
    escape, adding “This is the consequence of attempting to escape.” Mr. Rigi
    was 25 years old.
