    Mr. Turaj Malaieri (Ettehadieh Komonist-ha) is one of the 12028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Ettehadieh
    Komonist-ha was created by exiled opponents of the Pahlavi regime who
    mostly belonged to the Student Confederation. They followed the teachings
    of Mao Tse-Tung and did not believe in guerilla warfare. The group became
    marked by ideological divides during the periods preceding and following
    the 1979 revolution which caused it to split into several factions. One of
    the most important rifts was triggered by the decision by a number of
    members to take up arms and take over a city in Iran. The uprising plan,
    devised in the midst of an active and violent anti-communist campaign by
    the revolutionary Islamic government, split the Ettehadieh in two
    factions: one believing in the armed movement and the other opposing it.
    In the winter of 1982, armed members of the Ettehadieh hid in a forest in
    the North of Iran (Jangal in Farsi) outside the city of Amol. This group,
    also known as the Jangal group, was involved in several clashes with the
    Revolutionary guards and ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of
    Amol hoping to generate a general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol
    failed. It is reported that a number of the group s members, revolutionary
    guards, and civilians were killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently,
    members of the Ettehadieh, including those who opposed the Amol uprising,
    were arrested and tried for belonging to the organization and for having
    participated in the Amol clash. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    Mr. Malaieri s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Malaieri s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr.
    Malaieri is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Malaieri s defense.
    Judgment There is no information on the verdict leading to this execution.
