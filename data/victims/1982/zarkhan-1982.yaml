    The execution of Mr. Zarkhan, along with another person, was published in

    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr.
    Zarkhan was charged with drug dealing. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of
    the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to this report,
    Mr. Zarkhan and another smuggler were caught in possession of 1 kg and 100
    gm of heroin, several plastic bags for its packaging and one heroin dosage
    device. Defense No information is available on Mr.Zarkhan's defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Bushehr sentenced
    Mr.Zarkhan to death. He was executed.
