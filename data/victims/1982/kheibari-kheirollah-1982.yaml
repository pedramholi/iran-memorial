    The executions of Mr. Kheirollah Kheibari and another defendant were
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on March 13, 1982. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Kheibari was reported to be charged with two murders, causing
    fear and terrorizing, shooting in public places. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Kheibari's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Ilam sentenced Mr. Keibari to death. Having been confirmed by
    the Supreme Court of the Islamic Revolution, the sentence was carried out.
