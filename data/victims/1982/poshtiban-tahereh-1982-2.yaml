    Ms. Tahereh Poshtiban, daughter of Baqer Kolsum is one of the 430
    individuals whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. The rest of
    the information is received from friends and relatives. According to the
    existing information, Ms. Poshtiban was 21 years old, single and was born
    in Rasht, Gilan. She had seven sisters and brothers and was the last child
    in the family. She graduated from high school in 1979. When she was a
    student, she joined the supporters of Peikar Organziation. She used to
    distribute leaflets, Peikar publications and also write slogans. She also
    lived in the organization s safe houses for some time. She had left the
    organization and her organizational activities few months before she was
    arrested because of her criticisms on the organization. According to her
    friends, Ms. Poshtiban was kind-hearted, emotional and humanitarian. When
    her brother was disappeared during the Iran-Iraq war in 1980, felt very
    responsible towards her brother s four children and spent most of her time
    with them. After she was executed, her brother s wife says: It seems that
    I lost my husband for the second time. Ms. Poshtiban had a special wrath
    on the obscurantism and injustice of the Islamic Republic. Most people in
    the neighborhood knew her and her thoughts. The Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    Based on the existing information, there was a door bell at Ms. Poshtiban
    s house on 23 December 1981 around midnight when everyone was sleeping.
    Her father went into the yard to open the door. Armed people were standing
    on the walls. The revolutionary guards jump inside the yard; two of them
    enter the house and ask for Ms. Poshtiban. There was no arrest warrant
    with them. Ms. Poshtiban who was just woken up, started cursing at them.
    The revolutionary guards asked her to put on her clothes and they take her
    with them on a Peikan car. They also took books and photo albums that were
    in the house. Ms. Poshtiban was in the prison for 18 days. Based on the
    information provided to ABF, they first took him to Revolutionary Guards
    building in Rasht which used to be the Mohammad Reza Shah High School
    before the revolution. Later, she was transferred to the Navy Prison that
    was the women s prison at that time. There is no exact information on how
    many days she stayed there. She must have spent the very last days of her
    life in Chalus. Ms. Poshtiban s mother used to go to the navy hospital
    every day but they never allowed her to see her daughter. They also didn't
    tell her about Ms. Poshtiban s transfer to Chalus Prison. Trial No
    information is available on Ms. Poshtiban s trial. Charges There is no
    information available on the charges against Ms. Poshtiban, either.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Ms. Poshtiban. Defense

    friends and comrades ( M s. Tahereh Mirehsan , Ms. Minu Sotudehpeima , and

    Revolutionary Guards took their bodies to the Revolutioanry Guard s
    hospital in Lahijan n the same day. But her family was informed through a
    relative of an executed person on January 13th. Her father and brother
    went to Lahijan, requested to receive her body and took her body from the
    hospital the day after. When they got the body of Ms. Poshtiban, there
