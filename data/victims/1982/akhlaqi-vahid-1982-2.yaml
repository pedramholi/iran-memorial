    Mr. Vahid Akhlaqi’s execution was reported in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) in
    1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. The information about Mr. Akhlaqi is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs in the Path to Freedom by Rah-e Kargar publications, copyright
    1988. He was born in Kermanshah. He was a high school graduate, obtaining
    his high school diploma from the Arts and Crafts School of Kermanshah, and
    a sympathizer of the Rah-e Kargar Organization. He was in charge of
    distributing the publications of the Organization in Kermanshah. The
    officials of the Dizelabad Prison claimed that he committed suicide in his
    cell; however, according to the above source, "all the prisoners in the
    Dizelabad prison had no doubt that this rumor was a lie." "Rah-e Kargar"
    or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the
    summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various
    leftist groups who had rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in
    political action. They introduced themselves as Marxist-Leninists,
    promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat.
    They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they
    opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are unknown. According to the Rah-e Kargar book, Mr. Akhlaqi was arrested
    in the summer of 1981. He was first detained in a solitary confinement of
    the Revolutionary Guards Committee and was later transferred to the
    Dizelabad prison in Kermanshah. He was reportedly severely tortured
    repeatedly and in one instance, for an entire week. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available
    on Mr. Akhlaqi’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available about the defendant’s defence. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the defendant’s execution. Based
    on the information on the Mojahedin list, Mr. Akhlaqi died under torture
    in June 1982. But, the Rah-e Kargar book mentions that he was hanged in
    his cell in 1981.
