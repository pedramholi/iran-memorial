    News of the execution of Mr. Alamdar Salehi, son of Gholam, was sent to
    the Boroumand Foundation via electronic form by a person close to him. Mr.
    Salehi is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. According to available information, Mr. Salehi was 23 years old,
    single, born in Bardestan (Bushehr,) had a high school diploma and was a
    teacher and a supporter of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed theSoviet Unionas a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed thatChinahad deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime ofIran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Salehi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Alamdar Salehi are not known. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Salehi. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Salehi's defense. Judgment According to available information, Mr.
    Alamdar Salehi was hanged in public in the city of Bandar Abbas in
    1981-82. Mr. Salehi was 23 years old.
