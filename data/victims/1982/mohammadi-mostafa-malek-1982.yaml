    The execution of Mr. Mostafa Malek Mohammadi, along with five others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 27, 1982. Mr. Malek Mohammadi
    (Ettehadieh Komonist-ha) is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Ettehadieh Komonist-ha was created by exiled
    opponents of the Pahlavi regime who mostly belonged to the Student
    Confederation. They followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung and did not
    believe in guerilla warfare. The group became marked by ideological
    divides during the periods preceding and following the 1979 revolution
    which caused it to split into several factions. One of the most important
    rifts was triggered by the decision by a number of members to take up arms
    and take over a city in Iran. The uprising plan, devised in the midst of
    an active and violent anti-communist campaign by the revolutionary Islamic
    government, split the Ettehadieh in two factions: one believing in the
    armed movement and the other opposing it. In the winter of 1982, armed
    members of the Ettehadieh hid in a forest in the North of Iran (Jangal in
    Farsi) outside the city of Amol. This group, also known as the Jangal
    group, was involved in several clashes with the Revolutionary guards and
    ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of Amol hoping to generate a
    general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol failed. It is reported that a
    number of the group s members, revolutionary guards, and civilians were
    killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently, members of the Ettehadieh,
    including those who opposed the Amol uprising, were arrested and tried for
    belonging to the organization and for having participated in the Amol
    clash. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Malek Mohammadi s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Malek Mohammadi s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Malek
    Mohammadi was charged with active uprising with the apostate Union of
    Iranian Communists who is the enemy of God against the Islamic Republic of
    Iran, being in charge of the Union propaganda in Esfahan Industrial
    University, being responsible for the student section of the Union at the
    university, participating in safe houses, street appointments and team

    ,being active in absorbing forces in Mahalat, being in charge of the
    plastic store as a place for the Union members, participating in student
    ceremonies held by the Union, having several false names being an apostate
    by nature. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Malek Mohammadi s defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Esfahan declared Mr. Malek Mohammadi a
    corruptor on earth, an enemy of God and an apostate by nature and
    sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial
    Council, the sentence was carried out on July 20, 1982.
