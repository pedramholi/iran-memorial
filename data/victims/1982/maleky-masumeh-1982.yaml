    The execution of Ms. Ma sumeh Maleky was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on January 20, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges Ms. Maleky was charged with
    establishing a brothel and a din of vice in Esfahan. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Ms. Maleky's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Esfahan sentenced Ms. Maleky to death. The sentence was
    carried out.
