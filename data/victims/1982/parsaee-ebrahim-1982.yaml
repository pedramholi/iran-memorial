    The execution of Mr. Ebrahim Parsaee, along with ten others, was announced
    in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s
    Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily
    on December 22, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Parsaee was reported to be
    charged with dealing heroin, pleading guilty for having sold heroin over a
    period of time and being convicted 13 times. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Parsaee's defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tehran sentenced Mr. Parsaee to death. The sentence was
    carried out.
