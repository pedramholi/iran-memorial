    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Golestanfard, along with another
    person, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 18, 1982. This
    execution was also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    12028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    additional information about Mr. Golestanfard was taken from the web site
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). He was born in Kazerun, was a
    student in Shiraz University and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin
    Organization. During the first parliamentary elections in 1980, he was
    working in Kazerun in the Mojahedin election office. After the elections,
    when the Mojahedin's candidates were disqualified, the regime's agents
    attacked the office. Mr. Golestanfard was injured severely while trying to
    protect the office. Later, his younger brother, Sa'id, also a sympathizer
    of the Mojahedin, was killed in an armed conflict with the regime's agents
    near Marivan in 1986. Arrest and detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. According to the web
    site of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, Mr. Golestanfard was arrested in
    the student dormitory in Shiraz a few days after the demonstration of June
    20, 1981. He was detained for five months. The demonstration of June 20,
    1981, took place in protest of parliament's impeachment of President
    Banisadr and the Islamic Republic's systematic policy of excluding the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) from the country's politics, as well as
    the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO leaders and his
    insistence for them to disarm. Until then, the MKO had supported the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function within the
    framework of the new political system. On June 20, 1981, the MKO
    officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the regime by
    organizing mass demonstrations throughout the country in which some of the
    demonstrators were armed. These demonstrations, which were severely
    suppressed and ultimately resulted in the killing of dozens of
    demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    the Revolutionary Guards and paramilitary forces that targeted not only
    the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized as
    official government policy the months-old state harassment and suppression
    of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Golestanfard was a member of
    the military wing of the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO) which
    participated in assassination and destruction operations as well as armed
    uprising against the Islamic Republic. According to the Mojahedin’s
    website, the charges against Mr. Golestanfard were announced as
    "participation in the June 20, 1981 demonstration, membership of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, and giving one million Tomans in financial
    support to this organization". The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Golestanfard's defense. Judgment No specific information is available
    about this execution. Based on the newspaper report, Mr. Golestanfard was
    executed in Shiraz in the night of July 17, 1981.
