    The execution of Mr. Noruz Ali Safarpur was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on August 19, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Safarput was reported to
    be charged with adultery. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Safarpur's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shahr-e
    Kord sentenced Mr. Safarpur to death. Having been confirmed by Tehran s
    Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out at dawn.
