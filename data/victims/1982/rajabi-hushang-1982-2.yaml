    Mr. Rajabi was a member of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran. Mr.

    selling publications, and other activities in the organization. Mr. Rajabi
    had been politically active in Esfahan, during the reign of the Shah, and
    had spent a year in prison. After he got married, he moved to Mashhad and

    morally strong, influential, and honorable man. He was religious and
    virtuous. ( ABC Interview) The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and Detention Mr. Rajabi was arrested in the summer of
    1981. Officers who had had him under surveillance, picked him up in the

    the prison yard. They had no access to heating systems or sanitary
    conditions (Interview). Mr. Rajabi spent more than five months in prison.

    14, 1982, Mr. Rajabi and eleven other people were executed by firing squad
    in Vakil Abad Prison, Mashhad. Since Mr. Rajabi s family lived in Esfahan,
