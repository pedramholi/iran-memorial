    The information about Mr. Mohammad Ali (Farnush) Bakhtiari is taken from
    the website of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). This execution was
    also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published
    by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes 12028
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Bakhtiari was born
    in Bandar Anzali. He was a medical student in the Melli University of
    Tehran. After the Revolution, he joined the MKO. During the Cultural
    Revolution and after the closure of the universities, he returned to
    Bandar-e Anzali and worked as an English and natural sciences teacher and
    continued his cooperation with the MKO. He joined the Organization’s
    Resistance Unit after the demonstrations of June 20, 1981. The
    demonstration of June 20, 1981, took place in protest against the
    parliament's impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic's
    systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) from
    the country's political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet
    with MKO leaders and his insistence for them to disarm. The MKO had until
    then supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function
    within the framework of the new political system. On June 20th, the
    Organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations throughout the country. These
    demonstrations were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of
    dozens of demonstrators. Afterwards, there was a wave of mass arrests and
    executions by the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that
    targeted not only the MKO, but all opposition groups. The massive
    repression, unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic,
    legitimized the months-old state harassment and suppression of dissidents
    and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent political dissent.
    Arrest and detention According to the MKO website, the Revolutionary
    Guards surrounded Mr. Bakhtiari’s residence and arrested him. He was
    tortured severely while in prison. The same source quotes cellmates saying
    that he used his medical knowledge to help prisoners. This further evoked
    the anger of the prison officials and resulted in more torture for him.
    The efforts of Mr. Bakhtiari's family to obtain information about his
    condition were fruitless until his death. According to MKO the website,
    Mr. Mohammad Ali Bakhtiari died of injuries, caused by severe torture, in
    the hospital on December 10, 1982. This site quotes a hospital worker who
    saw the tortured body in the hospital saying "they broke both his hands
    and sent him to the hospital bloody and broken. The physicians’ efforts in
    saving him were fruitless." Trial No information is available about the
    defendant’s trial. According to the MKO website, Mr. Bakhtiari was
    detained without a trial for about a year. Charges No information is
    available on the charges against Mr. Bakhtiari. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defence No information is available about the defendant’s
    defence. Judgment According to the existing information, the defendant
    never was tried and no ruling was ever issued against him. According to
    the MKO website, the family and relatives of Mr. Bakhtiari gathered around
    his burial place every week and the regime's agents have repeatedly broken
    his tombstone.
