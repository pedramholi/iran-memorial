    Mr. Nasir Khaledi taught school in several cities, Melayer to Esfahan,
    encouraging young readers along his way. His wedding, planned for
    September, would be in Sanandaj. Information about Mr. Hushang Nasir
    Khaledi, son of Nosratollah, was drawn from an interview with a relative.
    His execution, along with eight others, was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on February 7, 1982. Mr. Nasir Khaledi was born in August 1951
    in Qorveh, in the western province of Kordestan. At the age of 16, after
    finishing the ninth grade, he went to the city of Kermanshah (located in
    the western province of Kermanshah) to continue his education at a
    technical high school. In 1969, he fulfilled the compulsory public service
    requirement, known as the Sepah-e Danesh (an alternative to the national
    draft), for two years. Having completed the two-year service, he started
    teaching at a technical school in Malayer (in the province of Hamedan)
    during the regular academic year. At the same time, he studied in Tehran
    during the summers. He earned his master s degree from the Behbehani
    School in Tehran before the 1979 Revolution. At the time of the
    Revolution, he taught in Esfahan. Mr. Nasir Khaledi was first arrested in
    the summer of 1979 for being outside of the house during a curfew. He was
    released on bail shortly after. He told his relative of the hasty,
    arbitrary, and unfair trials which led to the execution of several men who
    were arrested at the same time. In 1981, he moved from Esfahan to
    Sanandaj. The interviewee remembers Mr. Nasir Khaledi was an independent
    person, who was kind, loyal, compassionate, and patient. He was not
    influenced by the patriarchal nature of the culture at the time, and
    treated every one well. He encouraged others to read, study well, and
    enroll in university. He loved to teach and enjoyed being a role model. He
    was engaged and planned to marry his fianc e in September of 1981. Based
    on the information available, Mr. Nasir Khaledi was a sympathizer of the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, the Majority Branch. His younger brother,
    Bijan, was also executed in 1982. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. After the 1979 Revolution, the
    organization, which renounced armed struggle, split over their support of
    the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority
    supported and considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and
    anti-imperialist regime. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic
    Republic targeted its members solely because of their political beliefs.
    Arrest and detention One night in mid-June 1981, the Revolutionary Guards
    raided the Nasir Khaledis house. The interviewee says arrest without a
    warrant was the norm at the time. The guards searched the house and
    arrested Mr. Nasir Khaledi. They did not inform the family of his
    whereabouts after his arrest. It was only after a lot of persistence that
    his family found out that he was detained at the former headquarters of
    SAVAK (the National Intelligence and Security Organization of the Shah s
    regime). They were eventually allowed to have visits with him in prison.
    However, they could not speak freely since the visits took place under
    surveillance. Based on the available information, Mr. Nasir Khaledi was
    kept in a dirty room. He was tortured; the prison officials hit him so
    much that he lost his hearing in one ear. He was constantly called in for
    interrogation. He and his brother Bijan were detained in the same
    building. Trial The Jomhuri Eslami newspaper reported that Mr. Nasir
    Khaledi was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kordestan.
    However, the family was unaware of any trial. Charges Jomhuri Eslami
    reported that Mr. Nasir Khaledi and eight others were collectively charged
    with, armed insurrection against the Islamic Republic, participation in
    clashes in Sanandaj, participation in the central committees of the
    Hypocrites militia [referring to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization], the
    assassination of Muslims, bombing, and destroying public places. The
    report did not mention any charge brought against Mr. Nasir Khaledi
    personally. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available concerning Mr. Nasir Khaledi s defense. The interviewee states
    that the charges were completely false. Mr. Nasir Khaledi was not
    affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. According to the
    interviewee, I am sure that he did not have any armed activity. His
    personality and thinking were against armed action. He had no link to any
    armed group. Judgment According to Jomhuri Eslami , the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Kordes
