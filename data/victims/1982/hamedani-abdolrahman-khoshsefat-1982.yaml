    The execution of Mr. Abdulrahman Khoshsefat Hamedani, along with twenty
    others, was announced by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotic section
    of the Islamic Republic Public Prosecution Office and reported in the
    Jomhuri Eslami daily on March 3, 1982. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Khoshsefat Hamedani was a member of an
    international drug trafficking gang who had confessed to the supply and
    sale of 60 kg of heroin over a period of time and in whose house 23 kg of
    heroin as well as a laboratory material for heroin was discovered. He was
    a repeat drug trafficker. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Khoshsefat Hamedani's defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotic section of the
    Islamic Republic Public Prosecution Office sentenced Mr. Khoshsefat
    Hamedani to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council,
    the sentence was carried out.
