    She was born into a family of the Shah s opponents, herself later
    embracing non-violence. Her joyful spirit, even in prison, endeared her.
    The information regarding Ms. Shohreh Modir Shanehchi, a sympathizer of
    the organization Rah-e Kargar, was sent to Omid via an electronic form by
    her cellmate, Monireh Baradaran. This execution was also reported in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed in clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Furthermore, Ms. Modir Shanehchi is one of the 1533 executed
    prisoners listed by the Association of Iranian Women of K ln (Germany).
    The list published in 1997 is entitled: A partial list of names of women
    executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran. Ms. Modir Shanehchi s family was
    involved in politics and opposed to the previous regime. Her father, Haj
    Modir Shanehchi, was an influential tradesman from the Bazar and a
    supporter of the national religious movement and was close to Ayatollah
    Taleqani. Her sister, Zohreh, a member of the Fedaiyan Khalq Organization
    was killed in clashes with the security forces before the 1979 Revolution.
    After June, 20, 1981, all her family members were wanted and became
    fugitives. Her brother, Mohsen, was killed in clashes with security forces
    in 1981. Her other brother, Hossein, was executed in 1981. Her cellmate
    remembers her as a very popular person. Even in prison, she was joyful,
    and would practice dancing after her interrogation. Rah-e Kargar or the
    Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran was established in the summer
    of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist
    groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political
    action. They identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a
    socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed
    with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the
    Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini s leadership. The demonstration of
    June 20, 1981, took place in protest against the parliament s impeachment
    of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic s systematic policy of
    excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) from the country s
    political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO
    leaders and his insistence for them to disarm. The MKO had until then
    supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function
    within the framework of the new political system. On June 20th, the
    Organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations, in which some of the
    demonstrators were armed, all over the country. These demonstrations,
    which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of
    demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that targeted not only
    the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized as
    official government policy the months-old state harassment and suppression
    of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Arrest and detention Ms. Modir Shanehchi was arrested
    by the Baharestan Committee in Tehran on July 24, 1981 and was detained
    there for less than a month. She was then transferred to Evin Prison,
    where she was detained for 4 months prior to her execution. She was
    interrogated at Evin s Prosecution Office, Section 6. Ms. Modir Shanehchi
    was not given access to legal representation or allowed visitation with
    her family. She was interrogated several times about her political
    activities and asked to reveal where her father and brothers were hiding.
    Her cellmate states: they had no evidence against her. She was taken as a
    hostage in order for her father to come forward and introduce himself to
    the authorities. Shohreh was an example of those who were detained and
    executed without a specific charge. She was tortured at Evin. They flogged
    her feet by a cable. She came back to the cell in pain. Her feet were so
    swollen that she could not even wear oversized slippers, and she limped.
    Another time, when she came from interrogation, she told us that they had
    hung her from her two arms. Usually people who were taken for
    interrogation were taken from the cell in the morning and returned in the
    evening. They had to wait blindfolded in the hallway behind the
    interrogation room and listen to other prisoners being tortured. Trial Ms.
    Modir Shanehchi was tried in January 1982 at Evin Prison. Her trial
    reportedly lasted less than half an hour and she was not given access to
    her file and had no attorney present. Charges The defendant told her
    cellmate that she was charged with membership in Rah-e Kargar and t
