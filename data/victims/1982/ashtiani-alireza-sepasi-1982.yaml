    Mr. Alireza Sepasi-Ashtiani is one of the 430 individuals whose names
    appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh va
    Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the organization
    who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on
    this list have been executed. According to this report, Mr. Alireza
    Sepasi-Ashtiani was a senior member and a leader of the Marxist-Leninist
    Faction of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and a member of the Central
    Committee of the Peykar Organization. The biography of Mr. Alireza
    Sepasi-Ashtiani was published in the Peykar publication, number 44. He was
    born to a middle-class family in Ashtian. He entered the Fine Arts School
    of Tehran University as an architecture major in 1963. That year, he was
    arrested and condemned to two years imprisonment for his political
    activity with the Islamic Nations Party. He joined the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1971. In this organization, he participated in the
    assassination of Brigadier General Sa id Taheri. He moved out of the
    country in 1974 and returned to Iran in September of 1977. He was a Peykar
    candidate for the parliament. Mr. Alireza Sepasi-Ashtiani is one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.

    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
