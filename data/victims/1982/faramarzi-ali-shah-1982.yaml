    The executions of Mr. Ali Shah Faramarzi and another person were reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 7, 1982. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr.
    Shah Faramarzi was reported to be charged with armed collaboration with
    the famous armed robber, Seyed Khan who had already been executed. He was
    also charged with participation in disarmament of Ivan Police Station and
    Gilan-e Gharb clashes. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Shah Faramarzi's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Ilam sentenced Mr. Shah Faramarzi to death. Having been confirmed by the
    Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out.
