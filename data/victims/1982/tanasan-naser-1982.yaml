    The information about Mr. Naser Tanasan, son of Sadeq, has been drawn from
    an electronic form sent to Omid by a person familiar with this case. Mr.
    Tanasan was born in Tehran in 1959. He was a third-year student in
    mechanical engineering in School of Engineering of Tehran University. He
    started his political activities when he was a student and joined the
    Rah-e Kargar Organization. The sender of the form describes Mr. Tanasan as
    a calm, kind, and reasonable person, and one of the best students. Rah-e
    Kargar or the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran was established
    in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from
    various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and
    believed in political action. They identified themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini s
    leadership. Arrest and detention Mr. Tanasan was arrested around 10 a.m.
    on a day in December, 1981 or January 1982, and taken to Evin prison. His
    family was not aware of the place of detention. Mr. Tanasan was denied
    visitation rights during one and half months of detention. Trial There is
    no information regarding this trial. Charges Mr. Tanasan was charged with
    activism in the Rah-e Kargar movement and propaganda against the regime.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence
    presented against the accused. Defense No information is available
    concerning Mr. Tanasan s defense. Judgment Mr. Tanasan was executed in
    February 1982. He was 22 years old. According to the information in the
    electronic form, one of the authorities of Evin prison called his family
    and reported the location of his interment at Behesht-e Zahra Cemetery in
    Tehran. According to the same source, his picture has been placed on his
    gravestone twice and later destroyed by state agents.
