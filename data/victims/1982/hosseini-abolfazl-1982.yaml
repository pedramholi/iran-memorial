    Charges Mr. Hosseini was reported to be charged with opium dealing. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against defendants cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr.Hosseini's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Neishabur sentenced Mr. Hosseini to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out.
