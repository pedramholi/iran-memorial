circumstances: >
    The executions of Mr. Seyed Jalalodine Naruee and another person were
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on November 1, 1982. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Naruee was caught in possession of
    8.250 kg of heroin with another defendant and had personally imported
    narcotics from Germany. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Naruee's
    defense. Judgment According to this report, Mr. Naruee was hanged by
    fellow brothers in the Anti-Drug Committee of Bandar Abbas. There is no
    reference to the court which issued his death sentence.
