    The news of the execution of Mr. Ghazanfar Mohammadi, along with two

    and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Mohammadi was charged with Adultery. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mohammadi's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Anzali Port sentenced Mr. Mohammadi to death .The sentence was
    carried out.
