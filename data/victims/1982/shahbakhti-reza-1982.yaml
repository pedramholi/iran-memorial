    The information about Mr. Reza Shahbakhti has been sent to Omid, through
    an electronic form, by a relative. Additional information has been drawn
    from the indictment of other individuals who were also involved in the
    Nojeh coup, as published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on July 20,
    1980. Mr. Shahbakhti was born in Sabzevar (today in Khorasan Razavi
    province) in 1945. He was a high school graduate and served in the army
    during the previous regime. His file was related to the attempted Nojeh
    coup. According to available information, the planners of the Nojeh coup
    were members of the armed forces and the Iran Party (social democrat and
    part of the Iranian National Front) who opposed the religious rule and
    believed in the separation of church and state. The core of the coup
    d’état plan was to fly aircrafts from Nojeh base in Hamedan and bomb some
    military targets as well as the residence of Ayatollah Khomeini. Another
    team was to take over the radio-television building in Tehran in order to
    announce the coup and expose the motives to the population. On July 9,
    1980, the Islamic Republic of Iran authorities announced the discovering
    and dismantling of a civil and military network which had planned the coup
    d’état to overthrow the regime. Two months later, the organization Neghab,
    in a communiqué, claimed responsibility for this attempted “uprising.” The
    Organization attested that “the path of Mossadegh is that of the people”
    and today “Bakhtiar is its authentic leader… We have risen up to put an
    end to this curse [the Islamic regime] and to entrust the affairs of our
    land to the faithful disciple of Mossadegh – Shapur Bakhtiar” (Iran: In
    Defense of Human Rights, National Movement of the Iranian Resistance,
    Paris, 1983). Following the discovery of the plan for the coup, more than
    sixty officers and civilians were executed in several cities of Iran in
    less than a month. Most of the officers were still active in the army and
    had not been swept away in the first wave of purges which took place in
    the army after the fall of the monarchy. Executions of individuals
    involved in the Nojeh coup continued in the months and years to come; at
    least 200 persons were executed in relations to the coup. Nureddin
    Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet
    communist party) mentioned the coup d’état in an article dated May 2, 2000
    posted on the Rah-e Tudeh website. Kianuri stressed the fact that the
    military branch of the Tudeh Party, which cooperated with the Islamic
    Republic’s authorities, discovered and “neutralized” the above mentioned
    Organization as well as other groups that planned a coup against the newly
    established regime. Arrest and detention The details of Mr. Shahbakhti’s
    arrest and detention is not known, other than he was arrested in 1980 in
    Sabzevar. He was detained in several prisons, including Evin. His first
    visit with family was 18 months after his arrest. He was under
    interrogation for two years. Trial There is no information regarding the
    trial of this defendant, other than he was tried at a court martial.
    Charges Mr. Shahbakhti was charged with attempt to overthrow the regime of
    the Islamic Republic. In an indictment dated July 19, 1980, the Public
    Prosecutor said the following regarding some other participants of this
    alleged coup d’état plan: “These enthusiasts of the Shah’s rotten, filthy,
    and reactionary regime, these supporters of the blood-thirsty American
    imperialism, had in mind to bring ‘American social democracy’ as a gift to
    the liberated people of Iran. They had in mind to re-asses the opinion of
    our heroic nation about the return of the royal system through a
    referendum…” The Public Prosecutor emphasized: “This conspiracy was not
    planned in a vacuum and hence cannot be described in a single indictment;
    and these conspirators cannot be considered ordinary convicts. They are
    criminals who have undermined the newly regained truth, honor, and dignity
    of a liberated community of Muslim people. Considering this and consulting
    the holy verses of the Koran regarding the punishment of the ‘rebel’
    against the Islamic sovereign, it is imperative that the convicts receive
    their punishment according to the Shari’a law.” Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against the defendants. Defense No information is
    available regarding Mr. Shahbakhti’s defense. He was denied the right to
    have an attorney. Judgment Mr. Reza Shahbakhti was condemned to death and
    shot by a firing squad on December 8, 1982.
