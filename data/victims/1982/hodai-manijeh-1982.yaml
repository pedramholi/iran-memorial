    She held interests in politics, medicine, and logic and liked to elicit
    the views of people who disagreed with hers. On joining the student
    division of Peykar, she was given responsible positions. The information
    about Ms. Manijeh Hoda i has been drawn from an interview with her
    brother. She is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Additionally, her name is mentioned in the list of the Martyrs
    of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the
    names of those members of the organization who died after the revolution
    of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed.
    Ms. Hoda i grew up in a political family. Until the coup of August 19,
    1953, his parents were affiliated with the Tudeh Party. However, her
    mother continued her political activism secretly even after the coup.
    Discussing political news and articles broadcast on the radio was routine
    in their family. Manijrh went to elementary school in her birth place,
    Abadan. From childhood, she enjoyed studying and was among the best
    students at school. She won an award sponsored by a radio station and
    received her award from Farah Pahlavi. She spent the last years of her
    high school in Tehran. As a high school student, she became more
    interested in politics and was among the students who opposed the Pahlavi
    regime. Manijeh was good at technical subjects but she chose to go to
    medical school for she thought that she can serve better as a doctor. In
    1975 she enrolled in Tehran University and continued to be an opposition
    student activist. SAVAK, the National Intelligence and Security
    Organization of the previous regime, warned her on several occasions for
    her activities. Among the activities of opposition students was hiking. In
    March 1976, in a hiking trip, Manijeh and her group faced a disaster and
    several people died due to an avalanche. She was injured and hospitalized
    for some time. For some time she had to use when walking. Manijeh was
    initially affiliated with the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. However, at the
    time of the revolution, she joined the Peykar Organization and was a
    member of the central committee of the students division of Peykar, and a
    consellor of the central committee of the Organization. Ms. Hoda i was
    interested in theories, logic, and reasoning. She wanted to hear those who
    disagreed with her. In discussions she held radical opinions nevertheless
    in practice she treated people with compassion. One of her characteristics
    was that she was empathetic and she could understand the other people s
    problems and emotions. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social
    imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention Ms.
    Manijeh Hoda i was arrested on February 11, 1982, along with her husband,
    Mas ud Jigare i, one of the leaders of the Peykar Organization. On the
    same day, many other members of Peykar were also arrested. The arrests
    were announced on radio and television and official newspapers. Ms. Hoda i
    was interrogated in Ward 3000, which was renamed Tohid Prison. (Prior to
    the revolution, the same prison was called the Joint Anti-Sabotage
    Committee, which has become the Ebrat Museum since the early 1990 s.)
    After a few weeks, Ms. Hoda i was transferred to Evin prison. According to
    the available information, Ms. Hoda i was severely tortured. Two months
    after her arrest, when she was seen at the Hosseinieh of Evin prison, her
    feet were bandaged and she limped when walking, implying that she was
    flogged on the feet. At the Hosseineih, she publicly defended her
    political beliefs. This incident is reported in detail in the book Simple
    Truth , by Monireh Baradaran. In late April 1982, Ms. Hoda i had a visit
    with her mother, during which she told her that she was condemned to
    execution. She tried to console her mother and asked her to stay strong.
