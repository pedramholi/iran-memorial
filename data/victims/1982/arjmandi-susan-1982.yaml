    Ms. Susan Arjmandi is one of the 430 individuals whose name appears on the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This
    execution was also announced in the addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No.
    261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization on September 6, 1985.
    The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Ms. Arjmandi’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial There is no information regarding this
    trial. Charges The charges brought against the defendant are not known.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence
    presented against the accused. Defense No information is available
    concerning Ms. Arjmandi’s defense. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the verdict leading to this execution. Ms. Susan Arjmandi
    was hanged in Shiraz in April/May 1982.
