    News of the execution of Mr. Hatam Moradi, along with three others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on September 13, 1982. Additional
    information is based on several electronic forms sent to the Boroumand
    Foundation by persons familiar with his case. According to this
    information, Mr. Hatam Moradi, son of A zam, was born in Javanrud in 1959.
    He was married with one child, a Sunni, with an elementary school
    education. He was an asphalt worker and a sympathizer of the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI). He was a member of the Mahabad
    Committee in this party. The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI)
    was founded in 1945 with the goal to gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in
    northwestern Iran. After the Revolution, conflicts between the new central
    Shiite government and mainly Sunni Kurdistan regarding the role of
    minorities in the drafting of the constitution, specification of Shiite as
    the official state religion and, particularly, the autonomy of the region,
    ended in armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and the Peshmerga
    (the militia of the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1,
    1979, when people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime.
    On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan
    and declared it unofficial and illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke
    out and continued for several months in the region. By 1983, the PDKI had
    lost much of its influence in the region. In the years since, various
    leaders of the PDKI have been assassinated. Following internal disputes,
    the party split in 2006 and two organizations were established as The
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, and The Democratic Party of
    Kurdistan. Arrest and detention According to the information sent to the
    Boroumand Foundation, Revolutionary Guards of Javanrud entered Mr. Moradi
    s home, beat and arrested him around 11 p.m. on March 3, 1982. They took
    him to the Intelligence Office in Javanrud without informing his family.
    He was detained at this location for 13 days and then was transferred to
    the Intelligence Office in Bakhtaran (Kermanshah). According to the
    information sent to the Boroumand Foundation, quoting a cellmate, Mr.
    Moradi was tortured at the Intelligence Office in Bakhtaran for four days
    until his trial. After his trial and receiving the sentence, he was taken
    to this detention center three times to be tortured in order to reveal
    information about the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan. The rest of
    his detention period had been in the Dizelabad Prison in Kermanshah. He
    was denied the right to have an attorney and any outside contact. During
    his only visitation with his wife in the Dizelabad Prison in Kermanshah,
    marks of torture were so evident that he could not stand. His fingers and
    toenails had been pulled out and he could not speak clearly due to the
    severity of torture. Trial According to the information sent to the
    Boroumand Foundation, the Revolutionary Court in Kermanshah tired Mr.
    Moradi on April 17, 1982. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges According to the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper report, Mr. Moradi was
    charged with bombing in Ayatollah Kashani circle in Bakhtaran and blowing
    up a jeep, bombing of the railway lines in Arak and close collaboration
    with the mercenary government of Iraq. However, according to the report
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation, Mr. Moardi was tortured severely and his
    family were intimidated to accept his charges. According to people close
    to him, the real charge against Mr. Moradi was his membership in the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Moradi. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Moradi s defense. Judgment According to the information sent to the
    Boroumand Foundation, the Revolutionary Court in Kermanshah condemned Mr.
    Hatam Moradi to death. Branch Two of the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling on July 12, 1982. He was executed, along with three others, at
    Freedom Square in Kermanshah on September 12, 1982. Authorities did not
    deliver his body to his family and told them that he was buried in La
    natabad [damned place] cemetery in Kermanshah. They did not allow the
    family to have any mourning ceremony. However, the family paid a bribe
    through a middleman to receive the body, and buried him secretly in a
    cemetery in Javanrud. There is no more information about this execution.
