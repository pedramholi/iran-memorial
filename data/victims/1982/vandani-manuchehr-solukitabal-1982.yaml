    The execution of Mr. Manuchehr Solukitabal Vandani, along with five
    others, was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on December 11, 1982. The
    information about his charges was published in the same newspaper on June
    30, 1982. An individual familiar with this case has sent Omid additional
    information through an electronic form. Mr. Solukitabal Vandani was an
    electrical engineer and a university professor. He was also a member of
    the Nima Group, which was formed by officers of the Iranian army after the
    1979 revolution. The indictment stressed that the Nima Group, whose
    members had nationalistic views and had cooperated with members of the
    pro-Mossadeq National Front, “had a military and a political wing and had
    planned to overthrow the Islamic regime.” No other background information
    is available on the group. Nureddin Kianuri, Secretary General of the
    Tudeh Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet communist party), mentions Nima in an
    article dated May 2, 2000, (refer to the Rahe Tudeh website). Kianuri
    stresses the fact that the military branch of the Tudeh, which cooperated
    with the Islamic Republic’s authorities, discovered and “neutralized” the
    above mentioned group, as well as other groups that planned a coup against
    the newly established regime. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known other than Mr.
    Solukitabal Vandani was arrested in February/March 1982, around 11 p.m. in
    his house and taken to Evin prison. Trial The defendant, along with 4
    other members of the Nima Group, was tried in the military court on June
    30, 1982. There is no mention of a presence of a defense attorney for the
    defendants. Charges According to the news paper report, the military
    prosecutor read Mr. Solukitabal Vandani’s charges from an indictment,
    during his trial. The charges are as follows: “being a member of the Nima
    group, based on his own confessions, being dispatched to Esfahan by the
    group in order to attract members among the officers, and figure out the
    reaction of the army to a military action.” Also, it is mentioned in the
    indictment that he had nationalistic opinions. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available on Mr. Solukitabal Vandani’s
    defense. Judgment The Revolutionary Tribunal of the Islamic Republic of
    Iran Army sentenced Mr. Manuchehr Solukitabal Vandani to death and the
    verdict was confirmed by the Supreme Court. Mr. Solukitabal Vandani was
    executed on December 5, 1982.
