    wife’s former cellmate via an electronic form. Mr. Keshavarz was
    affiliated with Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Minority branch). The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and
    was active mainly in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest

    along with his wife, Ms. Shohreh Saburi, and his sister by the

    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. (Committee 3000 is the former Committee
    Against Sabotage, which was later renamed Tohidi prison; today it is a
    museum.) No further information is available regarding his arrest and
