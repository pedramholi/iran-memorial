    The information about Mr. Seyed Jalal Mirmohammad ali, son of Seyed
    Morteza, was sent to Omid by a former cellmate via an electronic form. His
    execution along with 8 other men was announced in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on February 7, 1982. Mr. Mirmohammad ali resided in Tehran. Mr.
    Seyed Jalal Mohammad Ali (The Democratic Party of Iranian Kordestan) is
    also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kordestan (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with the
    objective to gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in north-west of Iran. After the
    Revolution, conflicts between the new central Shiite government and the
    mainly Sunni Kurdistan, regarding the role of minorities in the drafting
    of the constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state
    religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in armed
    clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of
    the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, when people went
    to polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979
    Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan and declared it
    unofficial and illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke out and
    continued for several months in the region. By 1983, PDKI had lost much of
    its influence in the region. Various leaders of the PDKI have been
    assassinated. Arrest and detention The exact date of Mr. Mirmohammad ali s
    arrest is not known. He was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards at
    Enqelab square in Sanandaj, in the western province of Kordestan. He was
    taken to the detention center of the Revolutionary Guards where he was
    flogged on the feet. As a result his feet were injured. Trial Mr.
    Mirmohammad ali was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kordestan.
    Based on the information available, the trial lasted for 5 minutes.
    Charges The newspaper reported that Mr. Mirmohammad ali was charged with
    armed insurrection against the Islamic Republic, participation in clashes
    in Sanandaj, participation in the Central Committees of the militia of
    Hypocrites [a name Iranian officials use when referring to the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization], the assassination of Muslims as well as bombing and
    destroying public places. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The prosecution s witnesses
    were reportedly members of the Revolutionary Guards. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Mirmohammad ali s defense. He was denied a
    defense attorney. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kordestan
    called Mr. Mirmohammad ali at war with God and his Prophet and sentenced
    him to death. He was executed along with at least 5 other men in February
    1982 at the parking lot of the detention center of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court, located on 22 Bahman Street, in Sanandaj.
