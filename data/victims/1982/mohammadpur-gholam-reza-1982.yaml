    Mr. Gholam Reza Mohammadpur (Tufan) is one of the 12028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication

    as in many communist parties around the world. Three Tudeh leaders i.e.
    Forutan, Qasemi Saqa i left the Party in 1963 to found the Revolutionary
    Organization of the Tudeh Party and then the Marxist-Leninist Organization
    of Tufan . The organization changed its name after the 1979 revolution and
    first became The Party of workers and farmers of Iran and later on Iran
    Work Party, Tufan. The Party believed in a one-party system and supported
    a political system modeled after Albania, which it considered as the only
