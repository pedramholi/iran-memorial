    The information about Mr. Mohammad Davud Nuri has been sent to Omid, via
    an electronic form, by a relative. The execution of Mr. Nuri, along with
    ten other individuals, was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    November 1, 1982. Moreover, he is one of the 12028 individuals listed in
    an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Mr. Nuri was born in 1960 in Arak. He studied
    medicine in Tehran University and lived with his parents. He was
    sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Minority branch). The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and
    was active mainly in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest
    and detention The exact details of Mr. Nuri’s arrest and detention are not
    known. What is known is that he was arrested around noon in May/June 1981
    on Ashura Street in Arak. According to the available information, there
    was no warrant for his arrest. During his imprisonment, Mr. Nuri was
    beaten and punched while blindfolded. His family was not aware of his
    whereabouts for 7 months. Trial According to the newspaper report, Mr.
    Nuri was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Arak. His family
    was not officially informed of the trial, but his family members believed
    that the first trial condemned Mr. Nuri to 5 years imprisonment. Charges
    The sender of the electronic form stated that Mr. Nuri was charged with
    “being anti-revolutionary, cooperation with the Communist Minority
    Organization, and distribution of the newspaper of this Organization.” The
    newspaper reported that Mr. Nuri was “a member of the Central Committee of
    the Fadaiyan Khalq Guerilla Organization (Minority branch) that is at war
    with God.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against the accused. The sender of the electronic form
    emphasized that there was no evidence of guilt. Defense No information is
    available concerning Mr. Nuri’s defense. Judgment At a second trial, the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Arak condemned Mr. Mohammad Davud Nuri
    to death. The Supreme Court approved this ruling. Mr. Nuri, along with ten
    other individuals, were shot by a firing squad on the mountains near Arak
    on October, 26, 1982 at 4 a.m.
