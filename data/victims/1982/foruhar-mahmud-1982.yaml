    The information regarding the execution of Mr. Mahmud Foruhar (aslo
    spelled " Furuhar") , his wife Eshraqieh and another Baha i man,
    Badi'ollah Haqpeikar, was obtained from an announcement by the Office of
    Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General published
    in Sobh-e Azadegan and Ettalaat newspapers on 10 May 1982 and Kayhan on 11
    May 1982. Additional information was gathered from various documents,
    including his Will and a final letter written by him, published in the
    Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran (BPI). Mr. Foruhar is one of the
    206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report documents the persecution of Baha is
    in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the members killed since 1978.
    Additional information has been drawn from various issues of the The Baha
    i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Mr. Foruhar,
    son of Shokrollah, was born into a Baha i family in 1917 in Abadeh. He was
    married and did not have any children (BPI). He worked as an accountant
    for the National Oil Company in Tehran until his retirement in 1970. He
    and his wife then moved to Gohardasht, Karaj, where they both became
    elected members of the Local Spiritual Assembly. The Baha is in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Baha i National Spiritual Assembly After the
    Islamic Revolution In the organizational structure of the Baha i
    community, the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly is a body
    composed of nine individuals that are elected annually with the votes of
    adult Baha is in each country. This institution tends to the affairs and
    issues of the Baha i community on the national level. The National
    Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of guiding, coordinating, and
    moving forward the activities of each country s local spiritual
    assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl ( House of Justice
    ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the highest
    decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I s
    Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual
    assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz,
    were severely persecuted and the majority of their members were executed.
    In The Final Message of the Iran National Spiritual Assembly to the
    Friends of the Country , the Third Baha i National Spiritual Assembly,
    abiding by the principle of obeying the government, announced the closure
    of the Baha i organizations, and at the same time, sent an open letter to
    two thousand well-known and high-ranking government figures asking an end
    to the arrest, detention, torture, execution, and injustice against Baha
    is. (BBC Persian website, October 11, 2015). Judicial officials of the
    Islamic Republic have come up with [unreasonable and unacceptable]
    justifications for the persecution and the execution of the members of the
    National Spiritual Assemblies. In a speech on May 28, 1982, Ayatollah
    Khomeini said: The Baha is are not a religion, they re a [political]
    party; it s a party that was supported by Britain in the past, and now it
    s being supported by America. They are spies. (Sahifeye Noor, Volum
