    The information about Mr. Sirus Moradi is taken from the book Our Martyrs
    on the Path to Freedom by Rah-e Kargar Publications. He was born in
    Sanandaj, in Kordestan province. When he was a high school student, he was
    a sympathizer of the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran, Rah-e
    Kargar. In November 1981, he was arrested and released in Abadan, in
    Kuzestan province. Then, he moved to Tehran. "Rah-e Kargar" or the
    "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the summer
    of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist
    groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political
    action. They identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a
    socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed
    with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the
    Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention
