    The execution of Mr. Mahmud Mehnat Abadi was reported in the Johmuri
    Eslami daily on July 24, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Mehnat Abadi was
    reported to be charged with "drug smuggling." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to this report,
    Mr. Mehnat Abadi had confessed to the sale of more than 3 kg of heroin.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Mehnat Abadi's defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kashan sentenced Mr. Mehnat
    Abadi to death. The sentence was carried out at dawn.
