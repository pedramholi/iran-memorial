    The information about Mr. Ruzbeh Manafi Daryan is taken from an interview
    with his cousin, the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper dated January 30, 1982, and
    the book Parandeh Noparvaz (New Flight Bird) published by the Communist
    Party of Iran in 2004. Mr. Manafi (Ettehadieh Komonist-ha) is also one of
    the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. He was born in Tehran
    and a sympathizer of the Union of Iranian Communists (Sarbedaran). Before
    the Revolution, he went to the United States to pursue his education. He
    returned to Iran after the Revolution. According to the above book, he had
    various responsibilities in the Organization, but when the plan for armed
    uprising was considered, he volunteered to join the fighters (known as
    Sarbedaran). He arrived in Amol a day before the uprising. He was injured
    and arrested during a combat with Revolutionary Guards. The Ettehadieh
    Komonist-ha was created by exiled opponents of the Pahlavi regime who
    mostly belonged to the Student Confederation. They followed the teachings
    of Mao Tse-Tung and did not believe in guerilla warfare. The group became
    marked by ideological divides during the periods preceding and following
    the 1979 revolution which caused it to split into several factions. One of
    the most important rifts was triggered by the decision by a number of
    members to take up arms and take over a city in Iran. The uprising plan,
    devised in the midst of an active and violent anti-communist campaign by
    the revolutionary Islamic government, split the Ettehadieh in two
    factions: one believing in the armed movement and the other opposing it.
    In the winter of 1982, armed members of the Ettehadieh hid in a forest in
    the North of Iran (Jangal in Farsi) outside the city of Amol. This group,
    also known as the Jangal group, was involved in several clashes with the
    Revolutionary guards and ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of
    Amol hoping to generate a general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol
    failed. It is reported that a number of the group s members, revolutionary
    guards, and civilians were killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently,
    members of the Ettehadieh, including those who opposed the Amol uprising,
    were arrested and tried for belonging to the organization and for having
    participated in the Amol clash. Arrest and detention According to his
    cousin, Mr. Ruzbeh Manafi Daryan was arrested during the armed uprising of
    Sarbedaran in Amol. According to the book Parandeh Noparvaz , he was
    arrested by Revolutionary Guards on January 27, 1982. Trial According to
    the communiqu of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office in Amol
    published by Jomhuri Eslami , the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Amol
    condemned Mr. Ruzbeh Manafi Daryan to death. Charges Based on the
    communiqu of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office in Amol, Mr.
    Manafi was charged with armed uprising against the Islamic Republic of
    Iran, participation in organizing illegal armed forces in the forest,
    carrying out an armed attack on the town of Amol and its strategic areas,
    provoking clashes and shooting the defenseless Muslim people. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense Mr. Ruzbeh Manafi
    Daryan was denied the right to have an attorney. Judgment According to the
    above book, Mr. Ruzbeh Manafi Daryan was executed along with nine others
    in public in Amol Stadium on January 29, 1982. According to the
    interviewee, a friend of the family who was present at the execution, said
    : "A Revolutionary Guard shouted that 'It's the people who are executing
    you!' Ruzbeh replied, 'Take off my blindfold. I want to see the people.'"
