    News and information about the execution of Ms. Shidrokh Amir-kia B aqa
    (also spelled as Shidrukh Amir Kiya' Baqa) was obtained from Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center interview with her daughter and several documents
    including an open letter published by her daughter in February, 2009
    (Manoushid Baqa, August 26th, 2021). Additional information about her
    execution was obtained from the Baha I World, Vol. 18, IranWire, and the
    Archives of Baha I Persecution in Iran website. Ms. Amir-Kia Baqa is one
    of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report, Iran s Secret Blueprint for the
    Destruction of a Religious Community , documents the persecutions of Baha
    is in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the members killed since
    1978. (See also: www.question.bahai.org ). Additional information has been
    drawn from various other issues of the the Baha i World . See for example:
    Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Ms. Amir-Kia Baqa, daughter of R hu'll h
    M th q y n and Ruhn yyih Iqr r , was married and had three children (BW,
    Vol. 18). She was well educated, versed in the arts, and a devout Baha i.
    She had made the first ever recording of a Baha i prayer to music, which
    was played regularly at Baha i conferences and meetings. For a time she
    was a television personality, teaching cooking and other domestic skills.
    Around the time of the 1979 revolution, Ms. Amir-Kia Baqa had visited the
    US for her daughter s wedding and was urged by family not to return to
    Iran, as they feared for her safety given that she was an active member of
    the Baha i community in Tehran. She ignored their pleas and stated, I feel
    I am needed in Iran and [must] return there to do what lies in my power,
    regardless of the consequences (BW, Vol. 18). According to her daughter,
    Ms. Amir-Kia Baqa always told her children that they should be kind and
    never forget to serve humankind. She believed in justice and the truth and
    had refused to hide or change her beliefs (Open Letter, February 2009).
    Ms. Amir-Kia Baqa was steadfast in her faith until her execution and made
    a significant impression on those who shared a cell with her and beyond
    the prison walls. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background
    The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the
    Baha i threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national
    security in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Baha i
    National Spiritual Assembly After the Islamic Revolution In the
    organizational structure of the Baha i community, the institution of the
    National Spiritual Assembly is a body composed of nine individuals that
    are elected annually with the votes of adult Baha is in each country. This
    institution tends to the affairs and issues of the Baha i community on the
    national level. The National Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of
    guiding, coordinating, and moving forward the activities of each country s
    local spiritual assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl (
    House of Justice ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the
    highest decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I
    s Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual
    assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz,
    were severely persecuted and the majority of their members were execu
