    The information about Ms. Homa Nasr Zanjani is taken from the book The
    Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party Publications. She
    was born in Zanjan in August 1954. She worked at the Information and
    Tourism Office of that city. Later, she moved to Tehran to study Tourism
    and Hotel Management and, in 1978 she joined the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh
    Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh ideology was Marxist-Leninist
    and it supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party played a
    major role in Iran’s political scene until it was banned for the second
    time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the
    Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and therefore actively supported the
    new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention According to the
    above book, in May1982, the Police Patrols arrested Ms. Homa Nasr Zanjani
    in a Tehran street and took her to her house. There, they took some
    pictures from her personal album and told her family that it was not a big
    issue and they would bring her back in two or three days. The family was
    not informed of her detention location. After a persistent search, someone
    in the Revolutionary Prosecution Office told her family that she was at
    Evin prison. When her family visited the prison, prison officials told
    them that she was not there. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on Ms. Homa Nasr
    Zanjani’s charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available about her defense. Judgment According to the
    above book, subsequent to many visitation attempts at Evin prison,
    officials stated that she had died due to leukemia and internal
    haemorrhage. After some time, family was informed that Ms. Homa Nasr
    Zanjani had died under tortured on July 17, 1982, two months after her
    arrest, and was buried in the Behesht-e Zahra Cemetery. Her friends
    decided to exhume and examine her body. Her clothes were covered with
    blood stains and traces of torture could be detected on her body. No
    specific information is available about any possible ruling against the
    defendant.
