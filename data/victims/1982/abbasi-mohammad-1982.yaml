    Information about the execution of Mr. Mohammad (also spelled "Muhammad")
    Abbasi, father of three, was obtained from an announcement by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Qazvin published in Kayhan Daily Newspaper (June
    11, 1982), an electronic form sent to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center by a
    close person to Mr. Abbasi (December 27, 2007), Prosecutor of Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Qazvin s official order regarding his burial
    procedure (July 10, 1982), and a biography published the Archives of Baha
    i Persecution in Iran. Additional information about Mr. Abbasi was
    obtained from a letter sent by Siavash Mahboob on November 22, 1982 from
    the United Kingdom about the burial of several Baha is in Qazvin, and
    another sent by Shahram Mansuri in November 1983 from India, about the
    method of execution of several Baha is in Qazvin. Mr. Mohammad Abbasi is
    one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the
    Baha i International Community. The report documents the persecution of
    the members of the Baha i faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists
    members killed since 1978. Additional information has been drawn from
    various issues of The Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986,
    Haifa 1994. Mr. Moahmmad Abbasi was born in 1937 in Torbat-e Heydarieh,
    Khorasan Razavi Province, to a Muslim family (ABPI, Bio). He first moved
    to Mashhad when he was 10 to work at his brother s shop, where he worked
    for six years, before moving to Tehran to work at a Tailorshop (ABPI,
    Bio). He returned to Mashhad at 22, and upon turning 25 in 1962, he
    declared the Baha i faith. After relocating again to Tehran in 1963 and
    then Qazvin in 1973, he finally settled in a small town near Qazvin (ABPI,
    Bio). Mr. Abbasi was married to Mrs. Zivar Abbasi (Order of burial
    procedure July 10, 1981) and had three children (ABC Electronic Form). The
    Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the
    Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious
    community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300
    thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and Detention Mr. Abbasi was arrested on
    April 10th, 1982. He was initially held at an Islamic Komiteh in his
    local; area before being transferred to the Central Committee of Qazvin,
    and was subsequently detained at Chubin Dar Prison in Qazvin. He was held
    in detention for at least 90 days and was put under pressure to renounce
    his faith. According to his family, his body (received after his
    execution) showcased signs of torture (Shahram Mansuri November 1983).
    Trial According to a letter sent by Shahram Mansuri from India in November
    1983, Mr. Abbasi and seven others were sent to trial 45 days after his
    arrest, on May 24th, 1982. During the trial, four individuals who recanted
    their faith were released, and four others, including Mr. Abbasi, who
    refused to convert, were ordered back to detention (Shahram Mansuri
    November 1983). Charges The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qazvin
    announced the charges for Mr. Abbasi and three others as being active
    members of Baha ism in Qazvin and Assemblies of multiple small towns and
    were the main authorities and operators of this network, who in addition
    to vast propagation of Baha ism and encouragement and persuasion of youth
    to deviation from Islam and financial aid, had formed a small group in
    Qazvin with the name of Qiam-e Melli-e Iran [National Uprising of Iran]
    which was working to supposedly overthrow the Islamic Republic of Iran
    (Kayhan Daily Newspaper June 11, 1982). Due to the unanimous international
    condemnation of the p
