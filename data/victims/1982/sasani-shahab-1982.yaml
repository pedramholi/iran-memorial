    The execution of Mr. Shahab Sasani, along with two other defendants, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on April 5, 1982. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Sasani was charged with drug dealing. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.Sasani's
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Bakhtaran
    sentenced Mr. Sasani to death. The sentence was carried out after the
    confirmation of the Supreme Judicial Council.
