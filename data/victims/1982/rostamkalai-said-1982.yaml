    Mr. Sa’id Rostamkala’i is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on
    the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. According to this report, Mr. Sa’id Rostamkala’i graduated
    from college in Kiel, Germany. Mr. Sa’id Rostamkala’i is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.

    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
