    News of the execution of Ms. Maryam Abdolrahim-Kashi is based on an email
    sent to Omid by Ms. Mina Entezari, her cellmate at Evin Prison. Ms.
    Abdolrahim-Kashi is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    Mojahed magazine (No. 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. According to this information, Ms. Abdolrahim-Kashi, 18, was a
    senior class student at Hashtrudi High School in Tehran. She was single
    and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam to be their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to a split within the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in
    1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were
    released, along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize
    the MKO and to recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology. After the
    1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO
    accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were primary in the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, whether by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic s
    leaders. * Arrest and detention According to Ms. Entezari s report, Ms.
    Maryam Abdolrahim-Kashi was arrested, along with her friend Mahnaz Karimi,
    for being suspected of participating in a street demonstration at Vali asr
    Street in Tehran on August 30, 1981. They were transferred to Section One
    of the Evin prison around mid-September of the same year. They were both
    tortured severely by cable lashes. Their feet were injured and swollen in
    a way that they could not walk easily and needed help to move around.
    Later, they were transferred to Section 240 of Evin Prison. Ms. Maryam
    Abdolrahim-Kashi was denied any visitation with her family during her
    detention period. Ironically, her name was announced through loudspeakers
    to attend a visitation around early January of 1982, after her execution.
    Trial According to Ms. Entezari s report, Ms. Abdolrahim-Kashi was tried
    for a few minutes on a November day in 1981. No other information is
    available regarding her trial. Charges The charge brought against Ms.
    Abdolrahim-Kashi is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding evidence provided against
    Ms. Abdolrahim-Kashi. Defense No information is available regarding Ms.
    Abdolrahim-Kashi s defense. Judgment According to Ms. Entezari s report,
    Ms. Maryam Abdolrahim-Kashi was executed, along with Ms. Mahnaz Karimi and
    several others, on January 2, 1982. Ms. Abdolrahim-Kashi was 18 years old.
    _________________________ * The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or execu
