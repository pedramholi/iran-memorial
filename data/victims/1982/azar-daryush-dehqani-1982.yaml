    was sent to Boroumand Center via an electronic form on February 11, 2017
    by a relative. His execution, along with five others, was also reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on December 11, 1982. Mr. Dehqani Azar was born
    in Tabriz. He was married and had two children. He was graduated with a

    Guard and Army. (Electronic Form) The information about his charges was
    published in the same newspaper on June 30, 1982. Colonel Dehqani Azar was
    a member of the Nima Group, which was formed by officers of the Iranian
    army after the 1979 revolution. The indictment stressed that the Nima
    Group, whose members had nationalistic views and had cooperated with
    members of the pro-Mossadeq National Front, had a military and a political
    wing and had planned to overthrow the Islamic regime . No other background
    information is available on the group. Nureddin Kianuri, Secretary General
    of the Tudeh Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet communist party), mentions Nima
    in an article dated May 2, 2000, (refer to the Rahe Tudeh website).
    Kianuri stresses the fact that the military branch of the Tudeh , which
    cooperated with the Islamic Republic's authorities, discovered and
    "neutralized" the above mentioned group, as well as other groups that
    planned a coup against the newly established regime. Arrest and detention
