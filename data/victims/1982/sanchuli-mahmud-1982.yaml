    Mr. Mahmud Sanchuli, son of Mir Sadeq, is one of the 430 Martyrs of the
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on
    the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of 400
    members of the Organization who have been executed. He is also is one of
    the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985.
    The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups,
    who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic
    security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    Mr. Sanchuli was a student in the Teacher Training School of Zahedan and
    an activist for Peykar in the south eastern province of Sistan and
    Baluchestan. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Sanchuli
    s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Sanchuli s defense. Judgment According
    to Mojahed , Mr. Sanchuli was executed by firing squad in Zahedan on April
    10, 1982. He was 25 years old.
