    Workers Organization of Iran-Rah-e Kargar. "Rah-e Kargar" or the
    "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the summer
    of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist

    action. They identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a
