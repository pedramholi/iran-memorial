    The execution of Mr. Satar Rezazadeh, along with two others, was published
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on April 5, 1982. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr.
    Rezazadeh was charged with adultery. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of
    the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    Mr.Rezazadeh's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Anzali Port sentenced Mr. Rezazadeh to death. The sentence was carried
    out.
