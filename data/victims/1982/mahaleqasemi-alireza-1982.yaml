    The execution of Mr. Alireza Mahaleqasemi, along with another person, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on April 25, 1982 . The report quotes
    the sentence issued by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashad and
    confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council. Mr. Ali Reza Mahalehqasemi
    (Mojahedin Khalq Iran) is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded
    in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr.
    Mahaleqasemi was charged with supporting the Hypocrites' organization [the
    term the Islamic Republic authorities use to refer to the Mojahedin-e
    Khalq Organization or MKO], being the deputy [Deputy Secretary or the
    second most important person in the local organization's hierarchy] of the
    Taibad branch of this organization, being active in Mashad as the person
    in charge of liaisoning with Taibad, and being armed when arrested.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Mahaleqasemi's defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashad sentenced Mr.Mahaleqasemi to
    death. The sentence, having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial
    Council, was carried out. _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO
    members from government offices and the closure of their centers and
    publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities
    different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two.
    Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and
    the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin
    sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while distributing
    publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20,
    1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by
    governmental officials and the government officials efforts to impeach
    their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the
    regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets,
    some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The
    number of casualties that resulted from this demonstration is unknown but
    a large number of demonstrators were arrested and executed in the
    following days and weeks. The day after the demonstration, the Islamic
    Republic regime started a repressive campaign unprecedented in modern
    Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and sympathizers were arrested
    or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO announced an armed struggle against
    the Islamic Republic and assassinated a number of high-ranking officials
    and supporters of the Islamic regime. * In the summer of 1981, the leader
    of the MKO and the impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in
    France, where they founded the National Council of Resistance. After the
    MKO leaders and many of its members were expelled from France, they went
    to Iraq and founded the National Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which
    entered Irania
