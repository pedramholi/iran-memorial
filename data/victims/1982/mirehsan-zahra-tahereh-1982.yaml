    Ms. Tahereh Mirehsan, daughter of MohammadAli and Bajalal, is one of the
    430 individuals whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the 1979 revolution . More than
    400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Additional
    Information has been received from her friends, people who knew her and
    her comrades at the Organization. Ms. Mirehsan is also one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According
    to available information, Ms. Mirehsan was born in a traditional religious
    family in Lahijan. She was 23 years old, single and had high school
    diploma. She was a very good student at school. She was sensitive,
    emotional and organized. Upon finishing high school, she started working
    at Qazvin Spool factory with one of her friends. She joined Peykar
    Organization in 1979 and became a member in early 1981. She was active in
    the student department of the Peykar Organization. After a while, she was
    transferred to the publication department of the Organization in Rasht.
    Friends and relatives remember her as a good and noble person. They say
    she loved people; she was sensitive, reliable, mature and cordial. The
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by
    a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention Based on available information, Ms. Mirehsan was arrested
    along with two other friends at her home in Rasht on either 22 or 23
    December 1981. It seems that the house had been under surveillance. The
    revolutionary guards jumped over the walls into the yard and took all
    three away. Their room was sealed by the Prosecutor s office. Ms. Mirehsan
    was in Rasht for a couple of days and spent her last days of detention in
    Chalus Prison. She did not have any visitations during her 19 days of
    detention. Trial No information is available on Ms. Mirehsan s trial.
    Charges No information is available on Ms. Mirehsan's charges. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Ms. Mirehsan. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Mirehsan's defense. Judgment According
    to information collected on Ms. Mirehsan, she was executed by firing squad
    in Chalus on January 10, 1982 along with her three other friends. ( Ms.
    Sediqe Falakru , Ms. Minu Sotudehpeima , and Ms. Tahereh Poshtiban ) The
    revolutionary guards took her body to Lahijan hospital on the same day.
    Ms. Mirehsan and Ms. Minu Sotudehpeima s bodies were turned over to their
    families after they obtained a written permission and verbally pledged not
    to conduct any funeral ceremonies. They took the bodies to Agha Seyyed
    Mohammad cemetery. Tahereh s friends washed her body there. She had been
    shot once in the chest and once in the head. The authorities did not allow
    the family to bury her in the public cemetery because she was a communist.
    Ms. Mirehsan and Ms. Sotudepima, who were relatives, were buried in a
    family garden in Choshal village in Lahijan. Ms. Mirehsan was 23 years
    old.
