    Ms. Fatemeh Omidi is one of the 1,533 executed prisoners listed by the
    Association of Iranian Women of K ln (Germany). The list published in 1997
    is entitled: "A partial list of names of women executed by the Islamic
    Republic of Iran." A person who knew Ms. Omidi provided the Boroumand
    Foundation with additional information about her case through an
    electronic form (e-form). According to this information, Ms. Omidi,
    daughter of Teymour, was born in Tehran in 1957. She was a geology student
    in Melli University. After the revolution, she joined the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention According to the information provided by
    the e-form, she was arrested at her home in October 1981 at midnight. Ms.
    Omidi was arrested along with her two sisters, Ma sumeh, 20, and Kobra,
    16, and her brother, Rasul, 22. All four siblings were transferred to the
    Evin prison and eventually executed. Trial No information is available on
    the Ms. Omidi s trial. Charges The charges against Ms. Omidi are unknown.
    The validity of the criminal charges, if any, brought against Ms. Omidi
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. Evidence of guilt The report of Ms. Omidi s execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against her.
    Defense No information is available on Ms. Omidi s defense. Judgment
    According to the information on the e-form, Ms. Omidi was executed in the
    Evin prison either in November or December of 1981 or January of 1982.
    --------------------------------- * The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981,
    the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and
    assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the
    Islamic regime. In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the
    impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they
    founded the National Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many
    of its members were expelled from France, they went to Iraq and founded
    the National Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which entered Iranian
    territory a few times during the Iran-Iraq war. They were defeated in July
    1988 during their last operation, the Forugh Javida
