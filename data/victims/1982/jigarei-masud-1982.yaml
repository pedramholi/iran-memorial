    Mas ud Jigare i was politically adept, even in high school, ultimately
    serving on Peykar s Central Committee. Loud laughter, dark humor, and
    boundless love, were part of his legacy. Information about Mr. Mas ud
    Jigare i was sent to Omid in a letter from a relative. Additional
    information was gathered from an interview with a relative of his wife. He
    is also one of the 430 Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class, published on the Andeesheh va Peykar
    website. Of the 430 listed, 400 are members and sympathizers of the Peykar
    organization who have been executed. Mr. Jigare i was born in Tehran on
    July 5, 1955. His father worked at the Tehran Tobacco Factory and was a
    political prisoner under the monarchy. His mother was from a religious
    family in Esfahan. However, she vehemently opposed what she believed was
    outdated and reactionary thinking of conservative religion. As a high
    school student, Mr. Jigare i established a Marxist group, the work of
    which focused on social and political research. He was a brilliant student
    of Khajeh Nasiroddin Tusi High School in Tehran. When he took the national
    university entrance exam, he had the third highest score in electronics of
    those admitted to Tehran University. However, he declined the offer to
    attend Tehran University and enrolled in the School of Education in
    Qazvin, thinking he would be more useful as a public educator. He
    distributed oppositional leaflets in factories. He and a few friends
    established a communist cell in Qazvin and were politically active in that
    cell for four years. He joined a Marxist group that split from the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). This new group became known as the
    Peykar Organization; and Mr. Jigare i had an active role in its
    establishment in 1978. For security reasons, he had little contact with
    his family since the age of 18. Mr. Jigare i s relative remembers his
    brilliance and his boundless love. He was well-loved among family members,
    friends, and acquaintances. Anyone who knew him will never forget his loud
    laughter. He liked to joke and no one was immune to his simple and dark
    humor. Mr. Jigare i married Ms. Manijeh Hoda i, who was also affiliated
    with Peykar. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention In early February 1982, the revolutionary
    guards surrounded Mr. Jigare i s house in Tehran and arrested him and his
    wife when they returned home at night. The officials announced their
    arrest on February 11, 1982. Other leaders of the Peykar Organization were
    arrested at the same time. At the time of arrest, Mr. Jigare i was one of
    the five members of the Peykar Central Committee. Initially, Mr. Jigare i
    and his wife were taken to the detention center of the Joint Committee.
    (The Joint Anti-Sabotage Committee was established under the monarchy and
    used as an interrogation and torture location. After the Revolution, this
    detention center was renamed Tohidi Prison, also known as Ward 3000. Most
    cells in the prison are solitary. In the late 1990s, the detention center
    was turned into the Ebrat Museum.) Mr. Jigare i and his wife were
    transferred to Evin Prison a few weeks after their arrest. During the 11
    months that he was imprisoned, Mr. Jigare i was held incommunicado. Trial
    No information is available about Mr. Jigare i s trial. Charges No
    information is available about the official charges against Mr. Jigare i.
    Based on the letter of his relative, he was charged with being at war with
    God, anti-revolutionary, and opposed to the regime. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Jigare i s defense in court. He defended his political
    beliefs in prison. Judgment Mr. Mas ud Jigare i and his wife were shot by
    firing squad in December 1982. He was 27 years old. Iranian authorities
    did not announce the date of his execution and the location of his burial
    to his family. His name is not registered in Behesh
