    The information about Mr. Kamal Rahimian Kordestani was sent to Omid by a
    person familiar with this case. Mr. Rahimian Kordestani is also among the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Rahimian Kordestani
    was born in 1945 in Sanandaj. He held a master’s degree and worked as an
    architect at the state-owned Planning and Budget Organization as well as
    at a private company. Mr. Rahimian Kordestani was married and had a son.
    He and his family went underground in 1980. The sender of the form
    remembers Mr. Rahimian Kordestani as a successful architect and loved by
    all. Arrest and detention Mr. Rahimian Kordestani was arrested by the
    Revolutionary Guards at his mother’s house, near Tehran University in June
    1982. He was first detained in Tehran and later in Sanandaj. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr. Rahimian
    Kordestani was charged with “being at war with God.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Rahimian Kordestani’s defense. The sender of the form
    emphasized that Mr. Rahimian Kordestani “never shot at anyone.” According
    to information available, one of his relatives was shot and killed in
    battle between Kurdish armed groups and the Iranian state security forces.
    The sender of the form believes that the reason Mr. Rahimian Kordestani
    was charged with “being at war with God,” a charge often brought against
    armed dissidents, is only because of his relationship with the
    aforementioned relative. Judgment Mr. Rahimian Kordestani was condemned to
    death. He was executed by firing squad on August 24, 1982 in Sanandaj. His
    family was not allowed to bury him in the cemetery for the Muslims. The
    Revolutionary Guards buried him, without religious ceremonies, in the
    non-Muslim cemetery, located 20 kilometers away from Sanandaj.
