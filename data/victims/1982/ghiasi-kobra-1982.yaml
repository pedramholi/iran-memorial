    Ms. Ghiassi, a Peykar sympathizer, grew up near the Iraq border. Children
    loved her and would come around her. In Esfahan, political slogans could
    be seen on city walls in her handwriting. Ms. Kobra Ghiasi is one of the
    430 individuals whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. According to
    this report, Ms. Ghiasi was born in Abadan on March 22, 1959. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges No information is available on Ms. Ghiasi's charges. Evidence of

    available on Ms. Ghiasi's defense. Judgment According to the list of
    Martyrs of the Peykar Organization, Ms. Ghiasi was executed by firing
    squad in Esfahan on December 19, 1982. She was 23 years old.
