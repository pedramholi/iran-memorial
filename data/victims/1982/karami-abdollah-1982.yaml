    The information about Mr. Abdollah Karami is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs in the Path to Freedom by Rah-e Kargar publications, copyright
    1988. He joined the Rah-e Kargar Organization in 1979. He was arrested
    once and detained for six months. He was again arrested after the
    demonstrations on June 20, 1981and released later. "Rah-e Kargar" or the
    "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the summer
    of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist
    groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political
    action. They identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a
    socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed
    with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the
    Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. The demonstrations
    of June 20, 1981, took place in protest against the parliament's
    impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic's systematic
    policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) from taking
    part in the country's politics, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet
    with MKO leaders and his insistence for to disarm them. Until then, the
    MKO had supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to
    function within the framework of the new political system. On June 20th,
    however, the Organization officially changed its policy and tried to
    overthrow the regime by organizing mass demonstrations, all over the
    country . These demonstrations, which were severely suppressed and
    resulted in the killing of dozens of demonstrators, were followed by a
    wave of mass arrests and executions by the Revolutionary Guards and
    para-military forces that targeted all the opposition groups. The massive
    repression, unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic,
    legitimized the months-old policy of harassment and suppression of
    dissidents and ultimately resulted in the banning of all forms of
    independent political dissent. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown. According to the above
    book, Mr. Karami was arrested for the last time in April of 1982. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information
    is available on Mr. Karami’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available about the defendant’s defence. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the defendant’s execution. Mr.
    Karami was executed by a firing squad in the Evin prison during April,
    1982.
