    The execution of this unnamed person, along with two others, was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on April 17, 1982. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges This
    unnamed person was charged with drug dealing. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of
    the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on this unnamed
    person's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shirvan
    sentenced this unnamed person to death. The sentence was carried out.
