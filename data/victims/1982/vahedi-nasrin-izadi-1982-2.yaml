    Mr. Nasrin Izadi Vahedi is one of the 430 individuals whose name appears
    on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class” published on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list
    contains the names of those members of the Organization who died after the
    Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Additional information about Ms. Nasrin Izadi Vahedi is
    taken from an interview with one of her friends and the book From an
    Ebullient Ideal published by the Sympathizers of the Peykar Organization
    in September of 1985. Also a person close to her sent some information to
    Omid. This execution was also announced in the addendum of the Mojahed
    magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization on the
    6th of September 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated
    with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes
    with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the
    publication date of the magazine. Moreover, Ms. Nasrin Izadi Vahedi is one
    of the 1,533 executed prisoners listed by the Association of Iranian Women
    of Köln (Germany). The list, published on September 10, 1997, is entitled:
    "A partial list of names of women executed by the Islamic Republic of
    Iran.” This list has been updated by former political prisoners living in
    various countries. According to the available information, she was born in
    1954 and graduated from Tehran University with a degree in economics. She
    was an active member of the Peykar Organization and worked in the
    Theoretical Section of the organization. She had a ten month old daughter.
    Her husband, Behruz Jahandar Malekabadi, died under torture at Evin prison
    on February 17, 1982. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government, and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982, effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to the available information, police surrounded her house on
    December 29, 1981. She was arrested along with her husband and their ten
    month old baby. They were taken to Evin prison. The child was taken back
    to the family two days later. During her detention, her family was not
    able to visit her or receive any information about her. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information
    is available on Ms. Nasrin Izadi Vahedi’s charges. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available about her defense. Judgment No specific information regarding
    the death sentence is available. Ms. Nasrin Izadi Vahedi was executed by a
    firing squad at Evin prison on March 11, 1982. She was buried in the
    Behesht-e Zahra cemetery.
