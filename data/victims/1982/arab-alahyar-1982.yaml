    The execution of Mr. Allahyar Arab was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on February 3, 1982. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr.
    Arab was reported to be charged with the first-degree murder of his wife.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Arab’s defense. Judgment The 12th
    division of the Criminal Public Court of Mashad sentenced Allahyar Arab to
    death. The sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council. It was
    carried out.
