    The execution of Mr. Shokrollah Heidary was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on August 29, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Heidary was reported to be
    charged with raping an eight-year-old girl. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Heidary's defense. Judgment According to this report, Mr.
    Heidary, a corruptor on earth, was seized by divine wrath and executed.
    There is no reference to the Tribunal which issued the death sentence.
