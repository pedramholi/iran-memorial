    Mr. Jamshid Kharmanbiz is one of the 430 individuals whose name appears on
    the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list
    contains the names of those members of the Organization who died after the
    Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Additional information has been drawn from the Peykargar
    magazine (the publication of the Union of Peykargar Students for the
    Liberation of the Working Class, No. 11, Aug./Sep. 1987), and an
    electronic form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case.
    According to the available information, Mr. Kharmanbiz was born in 1960 in
    a city near Karaj (Tehran province) into a laborer’s family. He was a
    wrestler and a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Mr. Kharmanbiz was arrested in the winter of 1981-2 in
    Gilan province. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Kharmanbiz is not known.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Kharmanbiz’s defense. Judgment The
    details of the verdict leading to this execution is not known. According
    to the Peykar reports, Mr. Jamshid Kharmanbiz was executed on February 1,
    1982 in Noshahr (Mazandaran province); however, the sender of the
    electronic form states that the execution took place in Ghazian, near
    Bandar-e Anzali (Gilan province).
