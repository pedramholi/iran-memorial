    Born in Hamedan, 1961. Once, when he was 20, Revolutionary Guards came to
    arrest him, but he wasn t home. The information about Mr. Mohammad
    (Mostafa) Shafa at, along with two others, was announced in a communiqu of
    the Revolutionary Guards of Khorramabad and published in the Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper on July 25, 1982. Additional information is based on an
    interview by ABF with a person close to him. He was born in Hamedan in
    1961. He was a technical high school graduate and a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Revolutionary Guards attempted to arrest
    him in his house in the early summer of 1981, but he was not home at the
    time. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention Mr. Mohammad Shafa at was arrested in
    Hamedan in the spring of 1982. During two months of detention, he had only
    one or two visits with his parents. During a visit, he told his parents: I
    hope Iraqis will bomb the prison and kill us all. According to the
    interviewee, the prison conditions were so deplorable that he preferred to
    die. Trial This trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Khorramabad. No other information is available on the trial. Charges
    According to the communiqu of the Revolutionary Guards of Khorramabad, Mr.
    Shafa at was charged with leadership of the assassination operations of
    Mobasher, head of the Martyr Foundation in Khorramabad, and Azim Moradi.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    Mr. Shafa at was denied the right to be represented by an attorney. No
    other information is available about his defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Khorramabad condemned Mr. Shafa at to death and
    the Supreme Judiciary Council approved the sentence. Mr. Mohammad Shafa at
    was executed by firing squad in Khorramabad on July 19, 1982. He was 21
    years old. The interviewee, who was living underground at the time,
    learned of the execution through newspapers. He called Mr. Shafa at s home
    and his father suffered a heart attack after hearing the news of his son s
    execution. _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern
