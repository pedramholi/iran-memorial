    Defense No information is available on Mr. Salehi’s defense. Judgment
    There is no information on the verdict leading to this execution. *In the
    summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the impeached President
    (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they founded the National
    Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many of its members were
    expelled from France, they went to Iraq and founded the National
    Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which entered Iranian territory a few
    times during the Iran-Iraq war. They were defeated in July 1988 during
    their last operation, the Forugh Javidan Operation. A few days after this
    operation, thousands of imprisoned Mojahedin supporters were killed during
    the mass executions of political prisoners in 1988. Ever since the summer
    of 1981, the MKO has continued its activities outside of Iran. No
    information is available regarding members and activities of the MKO
    inside the country. In defense: In spite of the “armed struggle”
    announcement by the MKO on June 20, 1981, many sympathizers of the
    organization had no military training, were not armed, and did not
    participate in armed conflict. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
