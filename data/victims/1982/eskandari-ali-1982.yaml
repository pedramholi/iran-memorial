    The execution of Mr. Ali Eskandari was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on March 13, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Eskandari was reported to
    be charged with adultery and rape. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, hundreds of alleged common criminals are
    convicted following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Eskandari's defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Zanjan sentenced Mr.
    Eskandari to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council,
    the sentence was carried out at dawn.
