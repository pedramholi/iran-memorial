    Ms. Giti Asghari is one of the 430 individuals whose name appears on the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list
    contains the names of those members of the Organization who died after the
    1979 Revolution. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have been
    executed. She was executed along with her husband, Mr. Mahmud Afshar. Ms.
    Asghari’s name is also published in the list “Names of some of the women
    executed in the Islamic Republic.” This list was prepared by the Iranian
    Women’s Organization of Köln in Germany with the help of political
    prisoners. This list includes 1533 names. The execution of Ms. Giti
    Asghari was also announced in the addendum of the Mojahed magazine No. 261
    of the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization on the 6th of September 1985. The
    list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    her trial. Charges No information is available on the charges brought
    against Ms. Asghari. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms. Asghari’s defense.
    Judgment According to the Peykar list, Ms. Asghari was executed by a
    firing squad on the 7th of January 1982 in Tehran. The details of the
    court verdict are not known.
