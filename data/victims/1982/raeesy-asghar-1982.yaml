    The execution of Mr. Asghar Raeesy, along with two others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami Daily on April 20, 1982, quoting the public relations
    officer of the Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor's Office. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Raeesy was charged with smuggling opium and transporting it by
    tanker each time in 200 to 400 sacks- containing 7 kilos, and finally
    distributing it thereby endangering the society. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.Raeesy s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Esfahan sentenced
    Mr. Raeesy to death. The sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court of
    the Islamic Revolution.
