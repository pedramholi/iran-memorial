    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Sa id Rahimi, along with twenty others, was
    announced by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotic section of the
    Islamic Republic Public Prosecution Office and reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on March 3, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Rahimi was an international drug trafficker, charged with the
    transportation of 141 gm of heroin concealed in his body when going from
    Zahedan to Tehran. He had been convicted of drug-related offences,
    extortion, gambling and transportation of unauthorized weapons 17 times.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against defendants cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Rahimi's defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Section of
    the Public Prosecutor s Office sentenced Mr. Rahimi to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out.
