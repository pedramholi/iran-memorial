    Ms. Gita Dehqan, a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, is one
    of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Further information
    regarding this execution was sent to Omid via an electronic form by a
    person familiar with this case. Arrest and detention According to the
    form, Ms. Dehqan was arrested on September 16, 1981 at around 4 am at her
    house in the city of Kermanshah. She was told by the Revolutionary Guards
    that she was being taken in for some questioning. She was, however,
    detained and imprisoned at the Dizel Abad Prison in Kermanshah. Ms. Dehqan
    was detained for 11 months and was not allowed visitation for the first 3
    months. Some of her subsequent visitation times with her family were
    reportedly cancelled by the authorities. During the visitations she had
    told her family that the prison authorities never questioned her, instead
    they intimidated her whenever she requested to know the reason for her
    detainment. Ms. Dehqan had no access to an attorney and was not made aware
    of the charges brought against her. Trial Based on the information on the
    form, Ms. Dehqan did not have a trial. Charges The charges against Ms.
    Dehqan are not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms. Dehqan's defense.
    According to the information on the form, she was not a member of the MKO
    and only supported them verbally. Judgment The details of Ms. Dehqan’s
    sentencing are not available. She was executed by a firing squad at the
    Dizel Abad Prison on August 4, 1982.
