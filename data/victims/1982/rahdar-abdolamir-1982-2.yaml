    dated September 6, 1985. This attachment includes a list of 12028 people,
    most of whom were affiliated with political groups opposed to the
    government. These individuals were either executed by the government or
    killed during clashes with Islamic Republic security forces, from June 20,
    1981 up to the printing of this publication. Mr. Rahdar was born in 1956,
    into a working-class family with many children, in Abadan (Electronic
    form, March 19, 2022; Stories from Remember at Clubhouse, August 21, 2021;
    Shahrvand site, October 1, 2015). Rahdar attended school in Abadan and
    then Shiraz. After earning his high school diploma and completing his
    military service, he went to India in 1978 for higher education. He got
    married and began his studies in Mathematics and Statistics at Bengaluru
    University. Rahdar was one of the primary founders and activists of the
    Organization of Struggle for Liberation of the Working Class in Bengaluru
    in India, where he was active and well known (Stories from Remember at
    Clubhouse, August 21, 2021). Mr. Rahdar s friends generally describe him
    as friendly, happy, and genuine. He enjoyed sports, particularlysoccer
    (Stories from Remember at Clubhouse, August 21, 2021; Shahrvand site,
    October 1, 2015). The background of The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class The Peykar Organization for the Liberation
    of the Working Class was founded by dissident members of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state, believed that China
    had deviated from Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. Peykar was also joined by a number
    of political organizations known as Khat-e Se (The Third Line). The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government, along with internal
    splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982, effectively dismantled the
    organization and scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no
    longer in existence. The background of Iranian students' movements in
    India The British colonial presence in India established an education
    system and institutions similar to those in the developed countries.
    Combined with the lower cost of living and education, India became a
    favored destination for higher education for middle class Iranians since
    the Qajar era. Consequently, Iranian students' movements in India have a
    long history: since at least the 1970s, student activists opposing the
    monarchy of the Pahlavi dynasty joined groups such as the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, the Fadaiyan Khalq, the Tudeh Party, the Union of Iranian
    Communists, and the Ranjbaran Party of Iran, either as members or as
    sympathizers. The sympathizers of Ayatollah Khomeini gradually formed the
    Islamic Association of Students in the late 1970s. These associations
    competed with secular groups, particularly those with leftist and Marxist
    worldview. However, their rivalries were limited to recruiting new members
    from among not-yet-committed students and engaging in ideological debates
    in their periodicals (Oral History of Iran, Jun. 21,
