    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Sadeq Ebrahimifard, along with two others,
    was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami Daily on June 30, 1982. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Ebrahimi Fard was charged with dealing drugs. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against the defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Ebrahimifard's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Shiraz sentenced Mr. Ebrahimifard to death. The sentence was carried out.
