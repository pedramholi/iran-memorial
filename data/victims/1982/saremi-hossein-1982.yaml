    Mr. Hossein Saremi (The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan) is one of
    the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) was founded in Mahabad (West Azarbaijan province)
    in August 1945 and replaced the “Komalay Ziyanaway Kurd” (Council of
    Kurdish Resurrection, the first Kurd political group). In January 1946,
    while the North West parts of Iran were occupied by the Army of the former
    Soviet Union, the PDKI announced self-determination of “Mahabad Republic”
    which lasted for only 11 months. After the fall of the Mahabad Republic,
    the leaders of the PDKI were executed or imprisoned; some went underground
    or fled to Iraqi Kurdistan. After some time, the Party resumed its
    activities until with the coup of 1953 and the fall of Mossadeq’s
    government, it was repressed and turned to armed struggle. During the
    Revolution of 1979, the PDKI came to power in certain areas in the Western
    Iran. Conflicts between the new central Shiite government of Iran and the
    mainly Sunni province of Kordestan, regarding the role of minorities in
    the drafting of the constitution, specification of Shiite as the official
    state religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in
    armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the
    militia of the PDKI) particularly in the cities of Sanandaj (Kurdistan
    province) and Paveh (Kermanshah province). Subsequent to such conflicts
    that resulted in some casualties, on August 18, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini
    issued an order to the military and the armed forces to “move to Paveh and
    end the fighting…” In the same order, he encouraged them to use force and
    threatened that: “if they do not move toward Paveh within 24 hours with
    missiles and tanks and all necessary arsenals, I will hold them
    accountable. And in case of any infringement of this order, I will treat
    them in a Revolutionary manner” ( Sahifeh-ye Emam , p. 285). On August 19,
    Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the “party of Satan” and declared it
    “unofficial and illegal” noting that some of these “anti-Islamic”
    individuals had boycotted the referendum of April 1, when people went to
    polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime ( ibid p. 311). In
    accordance with Khomeini’s order, Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali traveled the
    western region of Iran and condemned many individuals to summary
    execution. Mass executions and conflicts continued for many months in the
    region. Disagreements between PDKI and the other major Kurd Organization
    called Komaleh brought about the death of hundreds of members on both
    sides. Moreover, as a result of the ruthless repression by the Islamic
    Republic, many members of the PDKI fled to Iraq. The Islamic Republic
    continued its fights against the PDKI. Various leaders of the Party were
    assassinated, such as Abdorrahman Qasemlu (Vienna, 1989), and Mohammad
    Sadeq Sharafkandi (Berlin, 1992). Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against the defendant is not known. Evidence of guilt The report
    of this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Saremi’s defense. Judgment There is no information on the verdict leading
    to this execution.
