    The execution of Mr. Mehrdad Mehrpur, along with five others, was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 27, 1982. Mr. Mehrpur (Ettehadieh
    Komonist-ha) is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. The Ettehadieh Komonist-ha was created by exiled opponents of
    the Pahlavi regime who mostly belonged to the Student Confederation. They
    followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung and did not believe in guerilla
    warfare. The group became marked by ideological divides during the periods
    preceding and following the 1979 revolution which caused it to split into
    several factions. One of the most important rifts was triggered by the
    decision by a number of members to take up arms and take over a city in
    Iran. The uprising plan, devised in the midst of an active and violent
    anti-communist campaign by the revolutionary Islamic government, split the
    Ettehadieh in two factions: one believing in the armed movement and the
    other opposing it. In the winter of 1982, armed members of the Ettehadieh
    hid in a forest in the North of Iran (Jangal in Farsi) outside the city of
    Amol. This group, also known as the Jangal group, was involved in several
    clashes with the Revolutionary guards and ultimately, on January 26,
    attacked the city of Amol hoping to generate a general uprising. The
    attempt to seize Amol failed. It is reported that a number of the group s
    members, revolutionary guards, and civilians were killed during the Amol
    clash. Subsequently, members of the Ettehadieh, including those who
    opposed the Amol uprising, were arrested and tried for belonging to the
    organization and for having participated in the Amol clash. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Mehrpur s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Mehrpur s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Mehrpur was charged with membership in the
    Union of Iranian Communists who are enemies of God, being extremely active
    in the organization, accepting Marxist principles as a school of thought,
    distributing Marxist publications and books, armed uprising against the
    Islamic Republic with the intention of overthrowing it, participating in
    street debates and supporting the Union s positions, being in charge of
    outstanding propaganda campaigns in Esfahan University and leading the
    youth astray according to the Union s interests, establishing a propaganda
    center, participating in team sessions and opening a plastic store and
    using it as a cover for group activities, providing 60 se rahi
    (explosives) for himself and his wife in order to fight with the
    revolutionary forces, being an apostate by nature, regarding the fact that
    he used to be a Muslim and believer in Islam. Evidence of guilt The report
    of this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against Mr. Mehrpur. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Mehrpur s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Esfahan
    declared Mr. Mehrpur a corruptor on earth, an enemy of God and an apostate
    by nature and sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme
    Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out.
