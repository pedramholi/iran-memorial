    The execution of Mr. Ataollah Charkhandeh, along with ten others, was

    Charkhandeh was reported to be charged with the supply of narcotics and
    concealment of 5 kg of heroin in a spare tire in the car. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Charkhandeh s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tehran sentenced Mr. Charkhandeh to death. The sentence was
