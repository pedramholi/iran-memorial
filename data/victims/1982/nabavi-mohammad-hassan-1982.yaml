    The information about Mr. Mohammad Hassan Nabavi is drawn from the book
    Our Martyrs on the Path to Freedom by Rah-e Kargar Publications. Since his
    early youth, he decided to fight injustice and discrimination. He was
    introduced to a Marxist group and in which became active. In 1971, he was
    arrested and condemned to eight years imprisonment for his connection to
    the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. He was released after the revolution and
    joined the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran, Rah-e Kargar. He
    was one of the leaders of the organization in Tabriz. In 1980, he visited
    Borujerd and after his return to Tabriz, he assumed leadership for the
    organization. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of
    Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded
    by individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They identified themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Arrest and detention In early 1982, Mr. Nabavi was arrested
    along with his wife in his residence in Tabriz. According to one of his
    relatives, the circumstances of his arrest were particularly frightening:
    around 10 o’clock at night, the officers entered the yard without ringing
    the bell, and immediately came into the house. About four armed men aimed
    their gun at him. His wife was chocked and was about to faint. Mr. Nabavi
    visited his wife a few times during his detention. His wife was also
    detained at the same time. Trial Mr. Nabavi’s trial was held in Tabriz
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal in March of 1982. The trial lasted for 10
    to 15 minutes. No specific indictment was read prior to, or during the
    trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Mohammad Hassan Nabavi’s
    charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense Mr. Nabavi did not get
    the opportunity to defend himself. Instead, he heard the religious judge
    preaching to him. Judgment No specific information is available about Mr.
    Mohammad Hassan Nabavi’s execution verdict. The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tabriz condemned him to death. His verdict was sent to the
    Supreme Judicial Court, where it was approved. He visited his wife in
    prison on the day of execution. Although he did not mention his execution,
    it is most likely that this unexpected visit was only to say goodbye. Mr.
    Nabavi, along with three other individuals, was executed at Tabriz Prison
    by a firing squad around 9 o’clock in the evening of the 2nd of May 1982.
    Women prisoners heard the sound of the firing squad and four single shots.
    The authorities returned Mr. Nabavi’s body to his parents, who buried him
    in the public cemetery of Tabriz. His will ends with a poem of Rumi.
