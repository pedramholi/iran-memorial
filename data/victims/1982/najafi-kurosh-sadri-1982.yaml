    The execution of Mr. Kurosh Sadri Najafi, along with five others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on December 11, 1982. The same
    newspaper, on June 30, 1982, published the charges against him. Mr. Sadri
    Najafi was a member of the Nima Group, which was formed by officers of the
    Iranian army after the 1979 revolution. No other background information is
    available on the group. Nureddin Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh
    Party (the Iranian communist party), mentioned Nima in an article dated
    May 2, 2000 (Rahe Tudeh website). Kianuri stressed the fact that the
    military branch of the Tudeh , which cooperated with the Islamic Republic
    s authorities, discovered and neutralized the above mentioned group, as
    well as other groups that planned a coup against the newly established
    regime. Supplemental information about Mr. Sadri Najafi was sent to the
    Boroumand Foundation by a person informed about this case. According to
    this information, Mr. Sadri Najafi was born in Tehran. He grew up in an
    affluent and educated family and had a Master s degree in economics. There
    is a piece of hand writing left from Mr. Sadri as his "will" of which a
    copy has also been forwarded to ABF by a person close to him. Arrest and
    detention According to the information sent by the electronic form, Mr.
    Sadri Najafi was arrested at a bus station in Tabriz and transferred to
    the Evin Prison. Trial Mr. Sadri Najafi, along with 4 other members of the
    Nima Group, was tried in a military court on June 30, 1982. There is no
    mention of the presence of a defense attorney for the defendants. Charges
    According to the Jomhouri Eslami newspaper, the charges that were read by
    a military prosecutor during the trial, based on the indictment for Mr.
    Sadri Najafi, were as follows: being a member of the Nima group; having an
    active and crucial role in the establishment of this group; being a
    participant in the demonstrations of the National Front at Ferdosi square
    on June 15, 1981; being appointed by Dr. Shaygan as the person in charge
    of recruiting nationalists and monarchists; and having a significant role
    in the military-political wing of this group. The indictment also
    mentioned that Mr. Sadri Najafi had nationalistic opinions. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against Mr. Sadri Najafi cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.

    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against him.
