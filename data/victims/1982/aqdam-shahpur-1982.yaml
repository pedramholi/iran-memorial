    The execution of Mr. Shahpur Aqdam, along with twenty others, was
    announced by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotic section of the
    Islamic Republic Public Prosecution Office and reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on March 3, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Aqdam was charged with being active in an international drug
    trafficking gang, possessing 13 gm of heroin and being convicted of
    drug-related offences as well as pickpocketing 22 times. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Aqdam's
    defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s
    Office sentenced Mr. Aqdam to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme
    Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out.
