    Agahollah Tizfahm moved from an underprivileged village to Orumieh to
    pursue his education, supporting himself as a street vendor near Lake
    Orumieh. He worked as a teacher for 14 years and was dismissed because he
    was a Baha i. One of his students, who was part of the firing squad,
    refused to shoot his teacher and was subsequently dismissed from his job.
    Information about the execution of Mr. Agahollah (Also spelled
    "Agahu'llah") Tizfahm, son of Kheirollah, was obtained from the dailies
    Ettelaat and Kayhan dated October 19, 1981, an interview of Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran (ABC) with his relative, on
    August 26, 2023 and an unpublished article provided by an informed source
    in 2003.[1] Mr. Tizfahmi is also listed as one of the 206 Iranian Baha is
    killed in Iran in a report published by the Baha i International
    Community. The report documents the persecution of the members of the
    Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since
    1978. Additional information has been drawn from various issues of The
    Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Mr.
    Tizfahm was born on July 3, 1939, in Norozlo village, Maragheh, East
    Azerbaijan, into a Baha'i family. Despite his father's wish for him to
    work in agriculture, Mr.Tizfahm was determined to pursue education. With
    no schools in his village, his father arranged for him to live with a
    friend in Miandoab for 8-9 years to continue his studies. (Unpublished
    article provided by an informed source, 2003) Mr.Tizfahm relocated with
    his family to Kechah Bash village in Orumieh, West Azerbaijan Province, in
    1959-60. Due to a lack of educational opportunities there, he rented a
    room in Orumieh to continue his studies. During summers, he worked as a
    street vendor near Orumieh Lake, selling soft drinks to support his
    education. After his military service, he joined the education department
    in Rezaieh in 1964. (Unpublished article provided by an informed source,
    2003) In 1965, at 26, Mr. Tizfahm married Ms Mahbubeh (Shahin) Alizadeh.
    In 1970, they moved to Tabriz for his two-year teaching training with
    their two children. After his father's death, he brought his mother and
    three sisters to live with them. He completed his studies in 1972 and
    returned to Orumieh. In 1974 Mr. Tizfahm joined the Orumieh Spiritual
    Assembly, until his arrest. In 1975, he was appointed to the National
    Assembly and the Regional Migration Committee for Azerbaijan, and attended
    the inaugural international promulgation conference in Tehran.
    (Unpublished article provided by an informed source, 2003) In 1978-79, Mr.
    Tizfahm began teaching at Azad University of Orumieh, but in 1980, he was
    dismissed from the Orumieh Department of Education for being a Baha' . To
    support nine family members, he and his wife started a peppermint water
    business and later opened a shop with friends. (Unpublished article
    provided by an informed source, 2003) The Baha is in the Islamic Republic
    of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected
    the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest
    religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979 [2]
    (Time Magazine, 1984- Baha i Studies,1984) to systematic harassment and
    persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The
    Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic
    Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result,
    the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status of a
    religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are
    banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice
    has subjected them to abuse and violence.[3] Persecution of Baha is in
    Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in
    this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the
    Baha i threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national
    security in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Spiritual
    Assemblies The affairs of the Baha i community are administered through a
    system of institutions, each with its defined sphere of action. At the
    local level, the affairs of the Baha i community are administered by the
    Local Spiritual Assembly and nationally by a National Spiritual Assembly .
