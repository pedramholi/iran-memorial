    News of the execution of Mr. Fereidun Parnak was obtained from interviews
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) with his sister.
    Further information has been collected from statements written Mr. Parnak
    s sister and friends. Mr. Fereidun Parnak is one of the 430 individuals
    whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh
    va Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the
    organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the
    individuals on this list have been executed. Mr. Parnak is one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According to available
    information, Parnak was born on April 26, 1959, to a farming family of the
    Kurdish Kalhor tribe in a rural area near the city of Gilan-e Gharb. He
    was the family s first child and dearly loved by all. He was an excellent
    student, and after receiving a high school diploma in mathematics in 1976,
    was accepted into Gilan University s physics program. He played an active
    part in the student movement during the Shah s time, and was often chosen
    to represent his fellow students. He was subjected to two short-term
    arrests by SAVAK (the Shah s secret police) and the university guard.
    Following the revolution he joined the Peykar organization and was active
    in Dal Dal, the organization s wing for high school and university
    students. At Gilan University he worked as an operator at Peykar s office,
    was responsible for the organization s publications stall, and worked to
    promote Dal Dal s theoretical views. On April 21, 1980, Pasdaran and other
    regime operatives launched an assault against the university to force its
    closure. Parnak and his fellow students mounted a defense of the campus in
    response. Following the incident, his name was falsely released as one of
    those who had been killed. He lived a brief period in Tehran before
    relocating to Islamabad-e Gharb, where he resumed his activities and
    became a member of Peykar s Central Committee. According to friends, he
    was one of the most intelligent of the Committee s members, and all relied
    on him. Parnak s sister relates: Fereidun was very dear to me. I m not
    going to mythologize him: like all people he was a complex of different
    things and was acculturated in the social and political conditions of the
    time. He affected me and our other family members in many positive ways.
    He was funny, kind, and eloquent. He was very handsome and well-dressed,
    and always popular. Owing to his many talents, Fereidun tutored the
    neighbors children. He was on good comradely terms with his friends, and
    always showed them kindness. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class was founded in 1979 by a number of dissident members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism.
    Peykar was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as
    Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the
    rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet
    policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a
    Social imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention Parnak
    was discovered and arrested on November 26, 1981, ten kilometers outside
    Islamabad by Pasdaran who had identified him as a communist during the
    revolution. At the time of arrest he was en route to his native Gilan-e
    Gharb with his paternal uncle owing to the risk of being captured and
    disappeared. He was transferred on to the Pasdaran Committee s prison in
    Islamabad-e Gharb. Following his arrest, agents went to Parnak s house and
    removed his photographs, tapes, and books. Parnak s two sisters 14 and 16
    years old were taken into custody the same day. In prison, Parnak was
    tortured and abused for being a communist without charges or evidence.
    After a series of blows were struck against the Peykar Organization in
    Islamabad and a number of its supporters arrested, the Committee s head
    turned over information to regime agents which resulted in new rounds of
    torture for Parnak. This treatment was such that he twice attempted
    suicide in prison. Parnak s mother and father met with him a few times,
    once in a hospital following a suicide attempt. His mother saw signs of
    torture on Parnak s body (ABF
