    A crafts teacher in Tehran Pars and a person of independent mind, she
    spoke up over voting irregularities as a 1980 election observer. The
    information about Ms. Shahla Hariri Motlaq, a teacher who was executed
    along with 125 other detainees, is based on an interview with one of her
    relatives. Ms. Hariri Motaleq is also one of the 12028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Ms. Hariri Motlaq was a secondary school teacher in
    crafts in Tehran Pars and a mother of two. She was pro Khomeini during the
    Revolution and afterwards joined the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, which
    was at the time an authorized political group. Her husband was a high
    ranking official in the Islamic Republic. Ms. Shahla Hariri was an
    observer during 1980 parliamentary election in a voting station. During
    the process of counting the ballots, she noticed that Rajavi s vote was
    counted as Rajai i. When she protested, she was assaulted by Hezbollah
    militias and was hospitalized with a broken nose and bruised body. Ms.
    Hariri was arrested once in August 1981 and spent 15 days in prison. She
    was released thanks to her husband and his influential friends in the
    Islamic Republic Party. However, according to her relative, the crimes she
    witnessed in prison, led her to become an active member of the Mojahedin
    Organization without the knowledge of her husband. Arrest and detention
