    The information about Mr. Valiollah Hosseini is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs in the Path to Freedom by Rah-e Kargar publications, copyright
    1988. He was born in Arak. He graduated in engineering from the Tehran
    Polytechnic College and worked in the private sector. After the
    Revolution, he joined the Rah-e Kargar Organization. He was working in the
    city of Masjedsoleiman in the summer of 1981, when the country-wide
    suppression of political dissent began. Because he was known there, he
    quit his job and moved to Tehran. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary
    Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    had rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action.
    They introduced themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown. Mr.
    Valiollah Hosseini was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards in Takhtetavus
    (Motahari) street of Tehran in the summer of 1981. Trial No information is
