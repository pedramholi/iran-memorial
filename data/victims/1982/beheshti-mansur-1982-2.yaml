    News of the execution of Mr. Mansur Beheshti, along with two others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in
    Khorramabad. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on
    July 25, 1982. Mr. Beheshti is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No. 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Information about Mr. Mansur Beheshti, son of
    Mohammadrafi , is based on an interview with a person close to him and
    several electronic forms sent to Omid by persons familiar with his case.
    According to this information, he was born in Alshotor, Khorramabad, on
    March 7, 1957. He was single, a high school graduate, and a teacher in
    Zagheh. There are various reports regarding Mr. Beheshti s political
    affiliation. In some of the electronic forms he was reported as a
    sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Majority and, in one form, he was
    affiliated with the Left Faction of this organization. The communiqu from
    the Islamic Revolutionary Guards described him as a central committee
    member of the Left Faction. According to another electronic form, he was
    affiliated with the Fadaiyan Khalq Minority. His name is listed among the
    victims of this organization. According to the interviewee, Mr. Beheshti
    was a member of the Fadaiyan Khalq Majority Left Faction. The Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization, a Marxist-Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban
    Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded
    in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following
    the 1979 Revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle,
    split over its support, respectively, for the Islamic Republic and the
    Soviet Union. A month after this split, other splits occurred. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Majority Left Faction was the first group to split over
    opposition with the Majority tendency to cooperate with the Islamic regime
    and joining the Tudeh Party. This group ended its activities after several
    years of publishing its views inside and outside of Iran. Arrest and
    detention According to the information sent to Omid and in the interview
    (above), Mr. Mansur Beheshti was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards at
    Dara izadeh Bridge in Khorramabad on January 30, 1982 around 11 a.m. He
    was transferred to the Revolutionary Guards base. He was identified in
    connection with the disclosure of a house where the printing machine of
    the organization was kept. He was denied access to an attorney or having
    any visitation. He was only allowed once to call his family. According to
    one form, he was tortured and kept in solitary confinement during his
    thirty-six-day detention. Trial According to the information sent to Omid
    , Mr. Mansur Beheshti was tried by the Islamic Revolutionary Court in
    Khorramabad in a closed session and without the presence of his family.
    Charges According to the Jomhuri Eslami daily, Mr. Mansur Beheshti, with
    the pseudonym Rahman, a Khorramabad resident, was charged with being a
    member of the Central Committee of the Left Faction and active
    participation in directing the operations for overthrowing the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. According to the information sent to Omid and the
    interview, the charges against Mr. Mansur Beheshti in his indictment were
    announced as fighting against God and the prophet and acting for the
    overthrow of the Islamic Republic. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the
    information sent to Omid , the evidence provided against Mr. Mansur
    Beheshti was confessions of others. Defense No information is available
    about Mr. Beheshti s defense. Judgment According to the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily, the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Khorramabad sentenced Mr.
    Beheshti and two others to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme
    Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out on Monday July 19, 1982, at
    dawn. According to the information sent to Omid and the interview, Mr.
    Mansur Beheshti was executed by firing squad at the Revolutionary Guards
    base in Khorramabad. His body and the bodies of two others were buried in

    After hearing the news on the radio, the family of Mr. Beheshti went to
    the authorities and found the location of his grave with the help of some
    acquainted clergymen. After they installed a tomb stone, it was destroyed
    by Hezbollah agents three times. They prevented the relatives from

    mother, the civil registration office in Khorramabad issued a letter
