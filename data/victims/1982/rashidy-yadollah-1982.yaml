    The execution of Mr. Yadollah Rashidy, along with six others, was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on June 23, 1982. The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Rashidy was charged with
    distribution and transportation of narcotics. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of
    the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Rashidy's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Ilam found Mr. Rashidy guilty of being the enemy of God and
    the Prophet and sentenced him to death. The sentence was carried out.
