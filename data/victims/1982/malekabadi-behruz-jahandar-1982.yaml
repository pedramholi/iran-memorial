    The information about Mr. Behruz Jahandar Malekabadi is taken from an
    interview with one of his friends and the book From an Ebullient Ideal
    published by the Sympathizers of the Peykar Organization in September of
    1985. Also a person close to him sent some information to Omid. His wife,
    Nasrin Izadi Vahedi, was also executed by firing squad in 1981. They had a
    ten month old daughter. He is also is one of the 12028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Mr. Jahandar Malekabadi was born in Esfahan, was an
    economics student in Tehran University, and an active member of the Peykar
    Organization. In 1975, he joined the Marxist-Leninist fraction of the
    Mojahedin Organization and began his underground political activities. In
    the fall of 1977 (under the previous regime), he was surrounded by police
    and started armed resistance (which lasted for two hours) along with one
    of his comrades. Though he was shot in his left hand, he was able to
    escape and go to a safe house. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation
    of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    details of his arrest and detention are not known. According to the
    received form, police surrounded his house on December 29, 1981. The
    police arrested him along with his wife and their ten month old baby. They
    were taken to Evin prison. The child was taken back to the family two days
    later. According to the available information, Mr. Behruz Jahandar
    Malekabadi was severely tortured. During his detention period, his family
    were not able to visit him or receive any information about him. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information
    is available on Mr. Behruz Jahandar Malekabadi’s charges. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available about his defense. Judgment According to the book From an
    Ebullient Ideal , Mr. Behruz Jahandar Malekabadi died under torture on
    February 17, 1982 at Evin. According to the interviewee, they did not
    return his body to his family. According to the received form, the family
    received the news of his death through an distasteful phone call from the
    officials. They did not even disclose his burial location to his family.
    Later on, through another source, the family found out that he was buried
    in the Khavaran cemetery.
