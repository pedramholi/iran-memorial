    The news of the execution of Mr. Ahmad Heidari, along with seventeen
    others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on September 18, 1982.
    Mr. Heydari (a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq of Iran Organization) is
    also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Heidari and other defendants were
    collectively charged with “collaboration with the counter-revolutionary
    grouplets who are enemies of God, activities against the Islamic Republic,
    attacking the fellow members of the police and military forces, trading
    weapons, extortion, committing the hideous act of sodomy, drug dealing and
    having relations with the members of the infidel Baas party.” There is no
    mention of the specific charges against the defendant. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Heidari’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Sanandaj declared Mr. Heidari an enemy of God and a corruptor
    and sentenced him to death. The sentence was carried out.
