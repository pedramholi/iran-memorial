    The information about Mr. Farhad Moradian, son of Mohammad, was sent to
    Omid by a former cellmate via an electronic form. His execution along with
    8 other men was announced in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on February 7,
    1982. His name is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. He lived in Sanandaj and sympathized with the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as
    its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam
    was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention Mr. Moradian was
    arrested by the Revolutionary Guards on October 31, 1981 in a safe-house
    near the office of the governor of Kordestan province. Trial Mr. Moradian
    was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kordestan in Sanandaj.
    Charges The newspaper reported that Mr. Moradian and 8 other men were
    collectively charged with armed insurrection against the Islamic Republic,
    participation in clashes in Sanandaj, participation in the Central
    Committees of the militia of Hypocrites [a name Iranian officials use when
    referring to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization], the assassination of
    Muslims as well as bombing and destroying public places. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    Based on the information available, the Revolutionary Guards testified
    against Mr. Moradian. Defense Mr. Moradian was denied a defense attorney.
    No information is available on his defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Kordestan called Mr. Moradian at war with God and
    his Prophet and sentenced him to death. He was executed along with at
    least 5 other men in February 1982 at the parking lot of the detention
    center of the Islamic Revolutionary Court, located on 22 Bahman Street, in
    Sanandaj. _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981,
    the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and
    assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and su
