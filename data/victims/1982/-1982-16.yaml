    The execution of this unnamed person, along with three others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on June 16, 1982. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges This person was charged with selling narcotics. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on this unnamed
    person's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashad
    sentenced this unnamed person to death. The sentence was confirmed by the
    Supreme Judicial Council and the Islamic Republic s Supreme Court of Qom.
