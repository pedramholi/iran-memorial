    The information about Mr. Hamid Safarinejad is based on an electronic form
    sent to Omid by a person familiar with his case. According to this
    information, he was born in Bushehr in 1953. He was a teacher with an
    associate degree and a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Minority
    Organization. He is among the victims on the organization s list of those
    killed. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist-Leninist group inspired
    by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America,
    was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    In 1981, the organization, which had opted for open political and
    electoral activity after the revolution, split over the critique of the
    concept of urban guerilla warfare and the support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic
    Republic and, though it did not abandon the theory of armed struggle, its
    activities were mainly limited to the political arena and the labor
    movement. Following the Mojahedin Khalq Organization s June 21st
    declaration of armed struggle, the Fadaiyan announced the organization of
    combatant cells. However, based on available information, these cells did
    not become operational. Many of the groups members and supporters were
    arrested and executed in the early 1980 s. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    According to the information sent to Omid, Mr. Hamid Safarinejad was
