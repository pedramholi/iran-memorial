    Information about Ms. Ehteram Kargar is based on two electronic forms sent
    to Omid by persons familiar with this case. According to the existing
    information, she was born in Esfahan. She was single, a student at Tehran
    University, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Her
    name is also reflected on the website of this organization, among the
    victims. However, according to one electronic form, she had no political
    affiliation and was a calm and smart girl. Her will is also published on
    the Asreno website on September 5, 2005. Ms. Ehteram Kargar is one of
    1,533 executed prisoners listed by the Association of Iranian Women of K
    ln (Germany). The list, published in 1997, is titled, "A partial list of
    names of women executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran." Ms. Ehteram
    Kargar is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No. 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with Islamic Republic
    security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam to be their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the
    1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to a split with the Marxist-Leninist Section
    of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of
    the MKO were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and Detention The circumstances of Ms. Ehteram Kargar s
    arrest and detention are not known. According to the information sent to
    Omid, she was arrested in Esfahan in 1982. According to this report, she
    was arrested by plainclothes agents, without any warrant or arraignment,
    for her personal beliefs. She was denied the right to an attorney. Trial

    information regarding the evidence provided against Ms. Kargar. Defense No
    information is available about Ms. Kargar s defense. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the defendant s execution. According to an

    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with the Islamic Republic authorities different interpretation
    of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of the new regime
    referred to the Mojahedin as hypocrites, and the Hezbollahi supporters of
    the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during
    demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the deaths
    of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
