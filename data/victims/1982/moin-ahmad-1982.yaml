    The information about Mr. Ahmad Mo’in is taken from the book Our Martyrs
    in the Path to Freedom by Rah-e Kargar publications, copyright 1988. He
    was born in Hamadan. He had been a political activist since his
    adolescence when he established a small group against the previous regime.
    In 1972, in his last year of high school, he was arrested and condemned to
    eight years imprisonment. During the Revolution, he was released and
    joined the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran-Rah-e Kargar. He was
    active in the Organization’s Gilan, Abadan, and Tabriz Committees; he was
    later transferred to the Tehran division. This execution was also reported
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO) in 1985. The list includes 12028 individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary
    Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They
    identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown.
    According to the book, Mr. Ahmad Mo’in was arrested at a secret meeting on
    December 27, 1981 and detained at the Evin Prison. He was reportedly
    tortured severely; but he would not disclose his true name. He introduced
    himself as Hamid Mo’ini. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Ahmad
    Mo’in’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains
    no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available about the defendant’s defence. Judgment No specific information
    is available about the defendant’s execution sentence. According to the
    book, Mr. Ahmad Mo’in, using the pseudonym Hamid Mo’ini, was executed by a
    firing squad in the Evin Prison on January 20, 1982. In his will addressed
    to his parents he signed his name Hamid Mo’ini.
