    Mr. Mirani, student, activist and asylum seeker in India had, on numerous
    occasions, received death threats from members of the Islamic Association
    of Students in Aligarh. Information about the death of Mr. Shahram Mirani
    was obtained through Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interview with an eye
    witness and close friend of the victim (Jan. 13, 2022) and with a former
    political activist and student in India (Sept. 3, 2021, Feb. 22 25 , 2022,
    July 29, 2022). Additional information was obtained from India Today
    magazine (Oct. 8, 1982), Brigham Young University Scholars Archive (Mar.
    12 , 2013), the website of Creative Anarchy (Nov. 2 , 1997), records of Be
    Yad Ar , Clubhouse (Aug. 21, 2021), Shahrvand magazine (Oct. 1, 2015), the
    weblog of Dard-e Moshtarak (Jun. 11, 2019), Enghelab-e Eslami newspaper
    (Dec. 29, 1979), Imam Khomeini Portal (Sept. 1, 1979, Aug. 28, 1980, Jan.
    4, 1981, Nov. 3, 1981), Gozaresh be Mardom ( Report to the public )
    published by Nashr-e Baran, written by Ali Akbar Omidmehr (2001-2002),
    interview with Mr. Ali Akbar Omidmehr (June 3, 2022), Djahan publication
    (Dec. 18, 1982), Oral History of Iran ( Tarikh-e shafahi-ye Iran, date of

    Shahram Mirani was born in Kermanshah. He was the only child of the
    family. Prior to going to India, he had worked - as an ice vendor in the
    villages around Kermanshah - to save money for his studies in India. Mr.
    Mirani left Iran after the 1979 revolution to study sociology in Pune
    (Poona); he later moved to Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh. He had political
    views of the Left, was a sympathizer of the Marxist-Leninist organization
    of the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) , and was active in student associations.
    He lost the benefit of the foreign currency allocated at a preferential
    exchange rate to overseas students, which allowed him to fund his studies,
    as a result of his political activities against the Islamic Republic. He
    had applied to the United Nations to seek asylum (interview with an
    eye-witness, Jan. 13, 2022; Facebook pages of Emdad in Iran, Mar. 11,
    2021). With a few other like-minded students, Mr. Mirani had started a
    campaign to disseminate information about the events in Iran. They
    distributed pamphlets and newspapers on the campus, amongst the academics
    and active Muslim students telling them of the repressive practices of the
    Islamic Republic such as raping girls in custody, inflicting qisas [the
    Islamic penalty of retaliation], and executing the opponents. On several
    occasions, he and his friends had received threats from the members of the
    Islamic Associations of Students, as a result of which they feared for
    their security. To alleviate their anxiety and fears for their safety,
    they often commuted in groups and held their reunions in a location
    outside the campus. They also briefed the university officials and the
    police of the threats they had received. Friends of Mr. Mirani described
    him as an energetic, gregarious, good hearted, sincere, and witty
    individual, steadfast in his commitment to his ideals; a man who could not
    remain silent before injustice and cruelty inflicted upon the vulnerable.
    (interview with an eye witness, Jan 13, 2022; Be Yad Ar, Clubhouse, Aug.
    21, 2021). The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly
    in the political arena and the labor movement. Background of Extrajudicial
    Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has
    a long history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the
    world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and
    outside the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing
    a large number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable.
    The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is
    not clear; however, these murders began in February 1979 and have
    continued since then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran
    attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been
    assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
    in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France,
    Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in
    Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases,
    there has not been much published, and local authorities have not issued
    arrest warrants. But documentation, evid
