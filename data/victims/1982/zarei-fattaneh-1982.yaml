    Introduction Information regarding Ms. Fattaneh Zarei s case is drawn from
    her father, Mr. Aziz Zarei s Memoir (Memoir) and an electronic from
    (E-form), which was sent to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) by
    a person close to Ms. Zarei on 11 September 2010. Ms. Fattaneh Zarei was
    born in Gachsaran. She studied accounting and worked as an accountant at
    the National Oil Company (ABF E-form). According to her father, she was a
    very studious and smart student. She was always smiling and was popular
    among people at her own age. She was a Mojahedin Khalq Organization s
    (MKO) sympathizer. She used to lead MKO s activities like distributing
    leaflets, writing slogans on the walls, etc in Gachsaran (Memoir, Pages 4
    and 37). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the
    closure of their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the
    Islamic Republic authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened
    the gap between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the
    Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime
    attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and
    while distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO
    supporters. On 20 June 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting
    their treatment by governmental officials and the government officials
    efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the
    fact that the regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to
    the streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and
    Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from this
    demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were arrested
    and executed in the following days and weeks. The day after the
    demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a repressive campaign
    unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and
    sympathizers were arrested or executed. On 21 June 1981, the MKO announced
    an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and assassinated a number
    of high-ranking officials and supporters of the Islamic regime (1). Ms.
    Zarei declared her candidacy in the first election for the first term of
    the parliament in March 1981 as the MKO candidate in Gachsaran. She earned
    numerous votes (Memoir, page 4). Ms. Zarei was first being watched because
    of her husband s activities and his subsequent escape. Ms. Zarei was
    wanted since the spring of 1982. A group of the Revolutionary Guards came
    to arrest her at her office but she successfully escaped to Bandar Abbas
    and joined her husband there (Memoir, page 8). After Ms. Zarei s escape,
    the Revolutionary Guards confiscated all her belongings including her
    furniture. Afterwards, her 13-year-old brother in-law was arrested on his
    way home from his school. He was interrogated about Ms. Zarei s and her
    husband s whereabouts. He was killed under torture (Memoir, page 9 and
    10). Arrest and Detention Ms. Zarei was arrested on 26 March 1982 on a bus
    from Bandar Abbas to Mashhad around 6 p.m. She was pregnant at the time of
    her arrest. The Revolutionary Guards raided the house which she was
    sharing with her husband and two others. Her husband was killed. Ms. Zarei
    and another lady escaped. They tried to go to Shiraz on a bus but they
    were arrested at a road police station (Memoir, page 34, ABF E-From).
    Immediately after her arrest, Ms. Zarei tried
