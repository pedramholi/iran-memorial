    Ms. Leila Faramarzian is one of the 1533 executed prisoners listed by the
    Association of Iranian Women of Köln (Germany). The list published in 1997
    is entitled: "A partial list of names of women executed by the Islamic
    Republic of Iran." Additional information about her has been sent to Omid
    via an electronic form by an individual familiar with this case. According
    to this form, she was affiliated with the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of
    Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh's ideology was Marxist Leninist and it
    supported the former Soviet Union's policies. The Party played a major
    role on Iran's political scene until it was banned for a second time
    following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh
    declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of its attacks from 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Ms. Faramarzian’s arrest and detention are not known
    other than she was arrested in Ahvaz. Trial There is no information
