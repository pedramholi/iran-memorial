    Ms. Minu Sotudehpeima, daughter of Esma il and Ozra is one of the 430
    individuals whose name appears on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Peykar Andeesheh. Additional information has been collected
    from her friends within and outside the organization. Ms. Sotudehpeima s
    execution was also announced in the addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No.
    261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization on September 6, 1985.
    The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. According to collected information, Ms. Sotudehpeima was born in
    a middle class family in Lahijan on 27 March 1960. She was single and a
    university student who worked in the Student department and Publication
    department of the Peykar Organziation in Rasht. Her fianc , Mr. Valiollah
    Rudgarian has also been executed. Friends and relatives remember her as a
    kind, serious and humanitarian person. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to available information, Ms. Sotudehpeima was arrested along
    with two other friends at her home in Rasht on either 22 or 23 December
    1981. It seems that he house had been under surveillance. The
    revolutionary guards jumped over the walls into the yard and took all
    three away. Their room was sealed confiscated by the Prosecutor s office.
    Ms. Sotudehpeima spent a few days in Rasht and the last days of her
    detention in Chalus Prison. She did not have any visitations during her
    19-day detention. Trial No information is available on Ms. Sotudehpeima s
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Ms. Soudehpeima is not known.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Sotudehpeima s defense. Judgment
    According to information collected on Ms. Sotudehpeima, she was executed
    by firing squad in Chalus on January 10, 1982 along with her three other
    friends. ( Ms. Sediqe Falakru , Ms. Tahereh Mirehsan , and Ms. Tahereh
    Poshtiban ) The revolutionary guards took her body to Lahijan hospital on
    the same day. Ms. Sotudehpeima and Ms Mirehsan s bodies were turned over
    to their families after they obtained a written permission and verbally
    pledged not to conduct any funeral ceremonies. They took the bodies to
    Agha Seyyed Mohammad cemetery. Minu s friends washed her body there. All
    four had been shot in the head. The authorities did not let the family
    bury her body in the public cemetery because she was a communist. Ms.
    Sotudehpeima and Ms. Mirehsan, who were relatives, were buried in a family
    garden in Choshal village in Lahijan. Ms. Sotudehpeima was 21 years old.
