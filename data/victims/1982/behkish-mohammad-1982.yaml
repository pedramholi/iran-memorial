    The information about Mr. Mohammad Behkish is based on an interview
    conducted on June 11, 2005 with a person close to him. He was a student in
    the Mashhad Institute Technology and a sympathizer of the Fadayian Khalq
    Organization (Minority). Mr. Behkish had joined the Fadayian Khalq
    Organization in November of 1976, before the split between the two
    factions of the Organization, and went underground. On March 14, 1982, he
    was shot and killed in the street by machinegun. He was not armed at the

    the Majority Faction), were also killed. Zahra died under torture in 1983,
    Mohsen was executed in 1985, and Mahmud and Mohammad Ali were executed in
