    The execution of Ms. Vajiheh Madadi was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily, quoting the public relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Hamedan . Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Ms. Madadi was reported to
    be charged with adultery. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, hundreds of alleged common criminals are
    convicted following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms. Madadi's defense.
    Judgment The 1st division of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Hamedan
    sentenced Ms. Madadi to death. The sentence was carried out.
