    The news of the execution of Mr. Esma'il Baqeri, along with seventeen
    others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami on September 18, 1982. Mr.
    Baqeri is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Baqeri and
    other defendants were collectively charged with “collaboration with the
    counter-revolutionary grouplets who are enemies of God, activities against
    the Islamic Republic, attacking the fellow members of the police and
    military forces, trading weapons, extortion, committing the hideous act of
    sodomy, drug dealing and having relations with the members of the infidel
    Baas party.” There is no mention of the specific charges against the
    defendant. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Baqeri’s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sanandaj declared
    Mr. Baqeri an enemy of God and a corruptor and sentenced him to death. He
    was executed on September 12, 1982.
