    The news of the execution of Mr. Hadi Azad and ten others was published in
    the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on November 1, 1982. Additional information
    about Mr. Hadi Azad is taken from the book Our Martyrs in the Path to
    Freedom , copyright 1988 by the Rah-e Kargar Publications. He was a
    17-year-old sympathizer of the Revolutionary Workers Organization of
    Iran-Rah-e Kargar. He sold and distributed the Organization’s
    publications. According to the same source, Mr. Hadi Azad was executed
    along with 14 others. This execution was also reported in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) in 1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They
    identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown.
    According to the book, Mr. Azad was arrested after the June 20, 1981
    demonstrations and was tortured severely. The demonstrations of June 20,
    1981, protested the parliament's impeachment of President Banisadr and the
    Islamic Republic's systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) from politics, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to
    meet with MKO leaders and his insistence to disarm them. Until that day,
    the MKO had supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to
    function within the framework of the new political system. On June 20th,
    the Organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations all over the country. These
    demonstrations, which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing
    of dozens of demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and
    executions by the Revolutionary Guards and paramilitary forces that
    targeted all opposition groups. The massive repression, unprecedented in
    the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized the months-old policy of
    state harassment and suppression of dissidents and resulted in the banning
    of all forms of independent political dissent. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Based on the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper report, Mr. Azad was a member of the “apostate and combatant
    Rah-e Kargar” organization. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available about the defendant’s defence. Judgment The
    Revolutionary Court of Arak condemned Mr. Azad to death. The Islamic
    Revolutionary Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and he was executed on
    October 27, 1982.
