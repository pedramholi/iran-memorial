    Ms. Sediqe Falakru is one of the 430 individuals whose name appears on the
    list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class published on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. Additional
    information regarding Ms. Falakru was collected from her friends and an
    e-form sent to Boroumand Foundation from one of her comrades at the
    Organization. This execution was also announced in the addendum of the
    Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated
    with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes
    with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the
    publication date of the magazine. According to available information, Ms.
    Sediqe Falakru was born in a middle class family in Tehran in 1959. She
    was single and was studying Persian Literature at Tehran University. She
    was admitted to Mashhad University to study History in 1976, but returned
    from Mashhad to Tehran after a few months. In 1977-78, she took the
    University Entrance Exam once again and was accepted at Tehran University.
    She was intelligent and hardworking but did not care about getting a
    degree or about her academic progress. She went to the university to join
    the intellectual political circles. Ms. Falakru joined the Peykar
    Organization after the Revolution in 1979. She worked in the student
    department of the Organization before she was arrested. According to her
    friends, Ms. Falakru was an intelligent woman, and a very kind, simple,
    and joyful friend. She loved joking and travelling. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention According to available information, Ms. Falakru was arrested
    along with her two other friends at her friends home in Rasht on either 22
    or 23 December 1981. It seems that he house had been under surveillance.
    The revolutionary guards jumped over the walls into the yard and took all
    three of them away. Their room was sealed by the Prosecutor s office. Ms.
    Falakru spent a few days in Rasht and the last days of her detention in
    Chalus Prison. She did not have any visitations during her 19-day
    detention. Trial No information is available on Ms. Falakru s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Ms. Falakru is not known. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Ms. Falakru. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Falakru s defense. Judgment According
    to collected information, Ms. Falakru was executed by firing squad in
    Chalus on January 10, 1982 along with her three other friends ( Ms.
    Tahereh Mirehsan , Ms. Minu Sotudehpeima , and Ms. Tahereh Poshtiban ).
    The revolutionary guards took her body to Lahijan hospital on the same
    day. There was a shot to the head of each of the four persons. The
    authorities did not let the family of Ms. Falakru bury her body in the
    Public cemetery. Ms. Falakru was buried in a friend s garden in Lahijan.
    Ms. Sediqe Falakru was 22 years old. .
