    The news about Mr. Mansur Jaberi s execution was sent to the Boroumand
    Foundaton through an electronic form by a person informed about this case.
    According to this information, Mr. Jaberi was born in 1947. He had an
    engineering degree and was a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Organization. The
    information about Mr. Jaberi s execution has been also reflected in a
    number of website such as Bidaran, Fadaiyan Minority Organization,
    Dialogt, and Makunews blog. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. After the 1979 Revolution, the
    organization, which renounced armed struggle, split over their support of
    the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. Arrest and detention

    trial. Charges According to the electronic information, the charge against
    Mr. Jaberi was announced as recovery of several phone numbers of political
    activists from his phonebook. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against Mr. Jaberi cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of Mr. Jaberi s
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against him. Defense No information is available on Mr. Jaberi s
    defense. Judgment According to the electronic form report, Mr. Jaberi was
