    Mr. Manuchehr (Sheikh) Soleimani is one of the 12,028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No, 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with Islamic Republic security forces, from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. According to this report, Mr.
    Soleimani was single, 20, a high school student, and a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. According to one electronic form, sent to
    Omid , a person with this name was born in Masjed-e Soleiman in 1971. He
    was a high school student and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, who was killed during the mass killing of the political
    prisoners in Masjed-e Soleiman in 1988. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principals of
    Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of
    Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in armed struggle against the
    Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic
    and social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a
    split within the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January
    of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along
    with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to
    recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution,
    and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were at the top of the organization s agenda. During the
    first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting
    numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but
    its efforts to gain political power, whether by appointment or election,
    were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic s leaders. * Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Manuchehr Soleimani s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Manuchehr Soleimani s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr.
    Manuchehr Soleimani is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Manuchehr Soleimani. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Manuchehr Soleimani s defense. Judgment According to the Mojahed
    magazine, Mr. Manuchehr Soleimani was executed in Masjed-e Soleiman in
    1982. There is no information on the verdict leading to this execution.
    _________________________ * The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981,
    the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and
    assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the
    Islamic regime. In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the
    impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they
    founded the National Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many
    of its members were expelled fromFrance, they went toIraqand founded the
    National Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which entered Iranian territory
    a few times during the Iran-Iraq war. They were defeated in July 1988
    during their last operation, the Forugh Javidan Operation. A few days
    after this operation, tho
