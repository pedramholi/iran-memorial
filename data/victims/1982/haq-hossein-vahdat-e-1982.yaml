    A masterful electrical engineer, educated in several countries, Mr.
    Vahdat-e Haq helped Baha is fired from their jobs after the revolution to
    re-tool for new trades, himself becoming C.E.O. of a Baha i-owned gas
    company, Asan Gaz. The information about Mr. Seyed Hossein Vahdat-e Haq
    (also spelled "Husayn Vahdat-i-Haq") has been drawn from interviews with
    his wife, Ms. Paridokht Vahdat-e Haq, his and her petitions to various
    authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran, his letter from prison (Feb.
    4, 1982; from Ms. Mahmehr Golestaneh s book A Tribute to the Faithful ),
    two court verdicts, and official correspondence. His name (spelled Husayn
    Vahdat-i-Haq ) is among the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999 report
    published by the Baha i International Community. The report, Iran s Secret
    Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community , documents the
    persecution of the members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran
    and lists the Baha is killed since 1978. Mr. Vahdat-e Haq was born on
    August 6, 1925 in Shiraz. He graduated from the military high school, and
    in September/October 1947 he was promoted to Second Lieutenant. He married
    in April/May 1950, and he and his wife migrated to Tehran, where he
    started studying electronic engineering and telecommunications. He
    continued his education in Electrical Engineering at the University of
    Stuttgart (Germany). He returned to Iran in 1959, holding a master s
    degree in Electrical Engineering. He travelled to Germany and Denmark
    several times to attend trainings; he studied in France for a year and a
    half. Before the Revolution, his superior offered Mr. Vahdat-e Haq a
    promotion. However, according to his spouse, the fact that he was a Baha i
    became an obstacle to this promotion. The 1979 Revolution led to Mr.
    Vahdat-e Haq s dismissal from the army without pension. Subsequently, he
    petitioned, among others, the Supreme Leader and the Revolutionary
    Council. His petitions contained elaborated argumentation about the rights
    of the Baha is, referring to verses of the Quran and Ayatollah Khomeini s
    statements. As many other Baha is were also discharged from their jobs,
    Mr. Vahdat-e Haq became a member of an occupational committee, established
    by the Baha i National Spiritual Assembly to teach various skills to the
    newly unemployed Baha is. Mr. Vahdat-e Haq soon started working as the
    chief executive officer of a gas company called Asan Gaz, owned by other
    Baha i individuals. He was not politically active. According to his wife,
    she received a false phone summons by an unidentified individual on April
    8, 1979, and, a week before his arrest, their house was under surveillance
    by plain-clothed persons. The arrest and execution of Mr. Vahdat-e Haq was
    not the end of his family s ordeal. His property and that of his wife and
    children were confiscated, and in 1984 his wife was arrested and detained
    for three months. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background
    The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the
    Baha i threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national
    security in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and
    detention Mr. Vahdat-e Haq was arrested on September 30, 1981, at 1:30
    p.m. in Asan Gaz Company by two representatives of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office. He was taken to the prison of the
    Committee to Combat Vice ( Dayereh-ye Mobarezeh ba Monkerat ). On the day
    of his arrest, the authorities searched his house, sealed some rooms,
    including his wife s room (where she had her clothes), and seized jewelry,
    rugs, television and
