    Mr. Arjang Rahimzadeh is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on
    the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. According to this report, Mr. Arjang Rahimzadeh had a
    bachelor’s degree in political science and law. He was a member of the
    editorial board for the Peykar Publication. News of the execution of Mr.
    Arjang Rahimzadeh was published in the Peykargar publication (publication
    of the Peykargar Student Union in West Berlin), annex number 1, on May 25,
    1983. According to this report, he was born in Quchanin 1953. He entered
    the Law School of Tehran University after graduating from high school. He
    was a founder of the Student Sympathizers of the Peykar Organization
    called Daldal. He was also a member of the editorial board of the Peykar
    and the Sixteen-Azar publications. He wrote many articles in these
    publications. According to one of his ex-comrades and a colleague on the
    editorial board of Peykar publications, Mr. Arjang Rahimzadeh was an
    enthusiastic human being, a hardworking individual, and true to his
    ideals. He was so indefatigable that he sometimes wrote most of the
    articles published in the Peykar weekly in spite of having no final
    decision-making power on the board. He was a well-known figure in the
    student movement and famous for clearly defending and expressing his
    opinions. Mr. Arjang Rahimzadeh is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in
    an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to the Peykargar publication, Mr. Arjang Rahimzadeh was arrested
    on February 3, 1982. The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Arjang
    Rahimzadeh's charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought against

    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Arjang Rahimzadeh's
    defense. Judgment According to the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization, Mr. Arjang Rahimzadeh was executed by firing squad in Tehran
    on 21 September 1982. No specific information is available about the
    defendant’s execution.
