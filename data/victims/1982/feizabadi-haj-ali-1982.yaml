    The execution of Mr. Haj Ali Feizabadi, along with ten others, was

    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Feizabadi
    was reported to be charged with supplying and distributing heroin,
    possessing 500 gm of heroin and being convicted twice. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Feizabadi's defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tehran sentenced Mr. Feizabadi to death. The sentence was
    carried out.
