    Mr. Azami s whole family was arrested, though he, a leader in Peykar, was
    never released. A symbol of resistance some called him. Information about
    the execution of Mr. Feridun A zami is based on an interview with a person
    close to him and a report, entitled In His Name, published in the Bidaran
    website. He is also one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the
    list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class, published on the website of Peykar Andisheh. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Mr. Feridun A zami had a bachelor s degree from Jondishapur
    University. He was married and had two children. He was a leader of the
    Peykar Organization for Freedom of the Working Class. Under the previous
    regime, he was imprisoned from 1973 to 1976. During the revolution, he was
    active in Khuzestan Province and then moved to Tehran in 1981. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (The Third Line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state; believed that China
    had deviated from Marxist-Leninist principles; and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government, and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982, effectively dismantled the organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Feridun A zami was arrested -- along with his wife and
    two children (who were released later) -- by the Revolutionary Guards in
    his house on January 6, 1982. He was first detained in the Joint Committee
    (section 3000) until August 1982. Then, he was transferred to Evin Prison,
    where he had access to an attorney. He had visitations, on and off, which
    took place behind the glass dividers in the visitation room at Evin. In
    May of the same year, following his wife s release, he was able to see her
    once. According to his relatives, he was tortured severely in prison and
    was a symbol of resistance in those years. Trial No specific information
    is available on the defendant s trial. According to an interviewee, during
    his visitation with his wife, Mr. Feridun A zami told her that he was
    coming from a two-minute court session. According to the same person, some
    witnesses stated that, three days before his execution, he had been in
    another similar court session. Charges The charges against Mr. Feridun
    Azami were announced in Iranian newspapers as membership in the Peykar
    Organization, apostate, and atheist. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available about his
    defense. Judgment Mr. Feridun A zami was executed at Evin Prison on
    October 30, 1982, in accordance with the court ruling. According to the
    interviewee, he was taken, along with his cellmate, Mr. Davud Mada en, to
    the execution place on three nights. Each night, they killed others and
    took Mr. A zami and his cellmate back. On the last night (which coincided
    with the Ashura Shiite ceremony), they were both executed by firing squad.
