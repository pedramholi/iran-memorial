    The execution of Mr. Khaled Fatahi, along with two others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on August 29, 1982. Mr. Khaled Fatahi (Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kordestan) is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in
    an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Democratic Party of Iranian Kordestan (PDKI) was
    founded in 1945 with the objective to gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in
    north-west of Iran. After the Revolution, conflicts between the new
    central Shiite government and the mainly Sunni Kurdistan, regarding the
    role of minorities in the drafting of the constitution, specification of
    Shiite as the official state religion, and particularly the autonomy of
    the region, ended in armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and
    the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum
    of April 1, when people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic
    regime. On August 19, 1979 Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the “party
    of Satan” and declared it “unofficial and illegal.” Mass executions and
    fighting broke out and continued for several months in the region. By
    1983, PDKI had lost much of its influence in the region. Various leaders
    of the PDKI have been assassinated. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr. Fatahi was
    reported to be charged with “collaborating with Kurdestan Democratic Party
    (KDP) and being armed when arrested during the clash in Ali Abad, located
    in Naqdareh.” Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Fatahi’s defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Takab sentenced Mr. Fatahi to death. The
    sentence was carried out.
