    The information about Mr. Mahdad Qorashi (Mahdaad Ghorashi), son of
    Shahrokh, is based on an electronic form sent to Omid by a person familiar
    with his case. According to this information, he was born in Tehran and
    was a junior electrical engineering student at the Science and Technology
    University in Tehran. Mr. Qorashi graduated from the high school of Math
    and Physics in 1978 and passed exams both for acceptance in Iran s
    universities and going outside of Iran for education. Due to family
    problems, he was not able to get his passport and leave Iran on time. So,
    he studied at the Science and Technology University. After all
    universities were closed during the Cultural Revolution, he began teaching
    math in middle school and became a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. According to the existing information, observing the
    conditions that the country was experiencing after the revolution,
    removing the first president in 1981, and the persistence of the
    government to continue war with Iraq after freeing Khorramshahr, caused
    Mahdad s anger towards those who were in charge. In spite of all the
    dangers, he tried hard to explain his beliefs to others and encourage them
    to support the Mojahedin Khalq. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic s leaders. * The Cultural Revolution began after
    Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech in March 1980 and ordered that
    universities be purged of all those who opposed his regime and be
    transformed into learning environments [as opposed to political forums]
    where an all-Islamic curriculum would be taught. The first wave of
    violence began on April 15,1980 during a speech by Akbar Hashemi
    Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister
    of Interior] at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech, students
    supporting the regime took control of the University s central building
    and demanded that the university be purged from pro-Shah elements and
    other sellouts. On April 18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution issued
    a communiqu accusing political groups of converting higher education
    institutions into headquarters of discordant political activities and
    naming them as obstacles to the radical transformation of the
    universities. The communiqu gave these groups three days (Saturday April
    19 to Monday April 21) to shut down their activities in the universities.
    The Council stressed that the decision included libraries along with
    activities related to arts and sports. Political groups, which recruited
    members and had strong support in the universities, refused to evacuate.
    Before the Council s deadline, serious clashes took place between leftist
    groups and Islamist Associations, which were at times supported by
    security forces and paramilitary groups. These clashes, which peaked at
    the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in the death of several people
    and the wounding of hundreds of others on university campuses around the
    country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic authorities announced the
    victory of the Cultural Revolution and the closure of all universities in
    order to Islamicize the curricula. The universities remained closed for
    two years. One of the outcomes of the Cultural Revolution was the purging
    of many university professors and students based on their political
    beliefs. Arrest and detention According to the information sent to Omid,
    Mr. Mahdad Qorashi left his home on October 14, 1982 in the afternoon.
    That night he did not return home a
