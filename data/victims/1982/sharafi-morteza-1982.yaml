    He dreamed of adding an element to the periodic table. Information about
    Mr. Morteza Sharafi, son of Mohammad, is based on an electronic form sent
    to Omid by a person familiar with his case. According to this information,
    he was born in Tehran in 1952. He was married and worked at the
    Dashte-Varamin power plant as a manager. Mr. Sharafi liked scientific
    experiments since his high school years, when he set up a small lab at his
    house and published a scientific magazine for his classmates. He dreamed
    of adding an element to the periodic table. In 1969, he was accepted at
    Tehran University as a physics major and published a preparation book for
    a college entry exam. He took this exam the next year and was accepted at
    Tehran Polytechnic University in an electrical engineering major, from
    which he graduated. He also had an engineering degree in irrigation from
    Ahvaz University. He was the first in his extended family to acquire a
    higher education degree and helped others to do the same. He was a
    sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. Mr. Morteza Sharafi is one of the
    559 individuals whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class, published on the
    website of Andisheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. He is
    also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No. 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on
    September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state,
    believing that China had deviated from Marxist-Leninist principles and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the [Peykar] Organization
    and scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention According to the information sent to Omid,
    Mr. Morteza Sharafi was arrested at his residence in Shiraz in April of
    1982. Agents charged him as anti-revolutionary and Mohareb [fighter
    against God], when arrested and transferred to Adelabad Prison in Shiraz.
    He had no contact with his family during the first two months after his
    arrest. He was also denied access to an attorney. Later, he had bi-weekly
    visitations, with his family behind a glass window for 15 minutes. He was
    once allowed to have a direct visitation with his family members in the
    presence of guards. According to the electronic form, Mr. Sharafi was
    tortured to confess. With the promise of no execution, his interrogators
    pressured him to do a televised interview. Trial The trial of Mr. Morteza
    Sharafi took place at the Revolutionary Guards location in Shiraz in April
    of 1982 and lasted half an hour. There was no witness present at the
    trial. Charges According to the information sent to Omid, the charges
    brought against Mr. Morteza Sharafi in the indictment were Mohareb
    [fighter against God] and disturbing national security. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    According to the information sent to Omid, authorities did not provide any
    evidence against Mr. Morteza Sharafi. Defense No information is available
    about Mr. Morteza Sharafi s defense. Judgment Mr. Morteza Sharafi was
    hanged at Adelabad Prison in Shiraz on November 23, 1982, at dawn.
    According to the form sender, authorities had informed Mr. Sharafi about
    the ruling and the date of his execution on the day of his trial. However,
    he informed his family during his last visitation, a week before his
    execution, to reduce their anxiety.
