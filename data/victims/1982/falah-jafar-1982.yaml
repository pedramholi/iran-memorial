    The execution of Mr. Jafar Falah, along with twenty others, was announced
    by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotic section of the Islamic
    Republic Public Prosecution Office and reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on March 3, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr.
    Falah was a professional drug trafficker who had a long history of
    supplying and distributing heroin, had confessed to the sale of 41/60 gm
    of heroin at two different times and had been convicted nine times.
    Besides smuggling, he also had a record for robbery and illicit
    relationships. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Falah's defense. Judgment The
    Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office sentenced Mr.
    Falah to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the
    sentence was carried out. According to this communiqu , he had been
    pardoned several times but did not learn his lesson.
