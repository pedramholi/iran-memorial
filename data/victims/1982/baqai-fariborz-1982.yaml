    The information about the execution of Mr. Fariborz Baqa'i, born in
    Esfahan, was a fourth-year electrical engineering student in Aryamehr
    University, was sent to Omid via electronic form by a person close to him
    who did not wish to be identified. The source specified that very little
    information has been available on the process leading to the execution of
    Mr. Baqa'i. The latter was known to have had leftist political leanings.
    Prior to his arrest, he had been attacked and stabbed (several times in
    the back) in the street by Hezbollah members in the spring of 1981 and had
    been hospitalized and treated. Mr. Baqa'i is remembered as a young man who
    loved to hike, hunt, and paint. He also was fond of pastries and
    creampuffs in particular. Further information regarding this case was
    gathered from the book Our Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism, a memoriam
    of the victims of the Rah-e Kargar Organization. Mr. Baqa i joined the
    Tudeh Party in the beginning of the 1979 Revolution. But due to the Party
    s obvious support of Khomeini, he left the Tudeh Party in 1980 and became
    a member of a revolutionary worker s organization, known as Rah-e Kargar.
    He was active in selling and distribution of pamphlets and publications in
    the street, and participated in street debates. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest are not known and the authorities
    did not inform the family of the arrest. Based on information provided to
    Omid, the family concerned by the absence of Mr. Baqa'i had looked for him
    in hospitals and had gone to the police where they had been informed of
    his arrest. According to the Rah-e Kargar book, he was arrested in Tehran
    on 4 August 1981. His arrest is reported to have taken place during a
    random control of cars in the Vanak Circle during which all the passengers
    of a car, including Mr. Baqa'i, were arrested. No information is available
    on the authorities carrying out the arrest. The defendant was not seen by
    his relatives after being arrested. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Baqa'i's
    defense. Judgment The defendant was sentenced to death and executed. Based
    on the available information, the authorities did not inform the family of
    the imminence of Mr. Baqa'i's execution and did not show them the
    sentence. The prison authorities reportedly informed the defendant's
    spouse who had gone to Evin prison to visit her husband that she should
    look for him at the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. The family's knowledge of
    the execution date is based on the cemetery's records.
