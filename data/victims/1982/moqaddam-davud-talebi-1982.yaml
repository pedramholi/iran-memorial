    Mr. Davud Talebi Moqaddam is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear
    on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This
    list contains the names of those members of the organization who died
    after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this
    list have been executed. According to this report, Mr. Davud Talebi
    Moqaddam was a senior activist and the Head of the Central Committee of
    the Student Organization of Peykar. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the trial. Charges No information is
    available on Mr. Talebi Moqadda’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Talebi Moqaddam’s defense. Judgment According to the list of Martyrs of
    the Peykar Organization, Mr. Davud Talebi Moqaddam was killed when
    tortured in the winter of 1982.
