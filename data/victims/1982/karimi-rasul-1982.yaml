    The information about Mr. Rasul Karimi, son of Abbasqoli, was based on an
    interview by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with a person close to
    him. He was only 17 years old when arrested and executed. International
    laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were
    under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the
    Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of
    the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an
    offence committed before the age of eighteen. Mr. Karimi is one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Karimi was born in
    Shiraz in 1964. After the revolution, he joined the sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization and became active in the Moslem Students
    Association, a subordinate of the organization. He loved sports and had a
    strong and beautiful body. He liked to make jokes and always laughed or
    smiled. He went to Tehran to participate in demonstrations on June 20,
    1981 and returned to Shiraz afterward. However, he was forced to the
    underground life when suppression and mass arrest of the Mojahedin
    sympathizers began. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    s leaders. * Arrest and detention According to Mr. Karimi s brother, a
    friend informed his family that he was coincidentally arrested by the
    Revolutionary Guards in a street in Shiraz in July of 1981. He was
    detained in Section Six of the Guards prison located at the Third Army
    Garrison in Shiraz. He had only one visitation with his family about three
    months after his arrest. His morale was great during this visitation.
    According to people close to him, he always had a happy attitude and could
    laugh and joke under hardship. Trial According to the interviewee, Mr.
    Karimi and five other sympathizers of the Mojahedin were tried on January
    5, 1982. He was the youngest. According to the only person who survived
    among these individuals, the religious judge, a cleric named Andalib,
    tried each person in six to seven minutes. Charges The charge brought
    against Mr. Karimi is not known. According to the interviewee, apparently,
    being a sympathizer of a member of the Mojahedin was enough to issue a
    death sentence at the time. Evidence of guilt According to the
    interviewee, authorities never referred to any evidence against Mr. Karimi
    during his brief detention period or after his execution. Defense Mr.
    Karimi was younger than 18 when arrested and executed. According to the
    only person who survived these six individuals, during the brief trial
    session, Judge Andalib asked Mr. Karimi to express regret and give up
    information to save his life. The judge told him: You are still a kid and
    your mouth smells of milk! Sit and tell everything you know, and save
    yourself. In response, Mr. Karimi stood up and cried: Death to Khomeini!
    And Long live the Mojahedin! Judgment A court condemned five out of the
    group of six including Mr. Rasul Karimi to death. He was executed by
    firing squad, along with four others, at Chogan Garrison in Shiraz on
    January 6, 1982 at dawn. According to the interviewee, his body was not
    given to his family. Authorities told the fam
