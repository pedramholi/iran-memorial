    Information about Mr. Siavash Tavakoli has been sent to Omid by his
    daughter. Additional information has been taken from the Public
    Prosecutor’s indictment dated July 19, 1980 (published in the Enqelab
    Eslami and Jomhuri Eslami newspapers a day later). Mr. Tavakoli was born
    on November 28, 1936 in Behshahr (Mazandaran province). He was an
    engineer, a husband, and a father of two. Mr. Tavakoli was one of the
    founders of the Organization of the Nationalist Movement of Students,
    Professors, and the Enlightened. This Organization was part of the Neqab
    group, which claimed responsibility for the Nojeh coup. Mr. Tavakoli’s
    daughter remembers his brown eyes, full of kindness, and she refers to him
    as a generous and courageous man. According to available information, the
    planners of the Nojeh coup were members of the armed forces and the Iran
    Party (social democrat and part of the Iranian National Front) who opposed
    the religious rule and believed in the separation of church and state. The
    core of the coup d’état plan was to fly aircrafts from Nojeh base in
    Hamedan and bomb some military targets as well as the residence of
    Ayatollah Khomeini. Another team was to take over the radio-television
    building in Tehran in order to announce the coup and expose the motives to
    the population. On July 9, 1980, the Islamic Republic of Iran authorities
    announced the discovering and dismantling of a civil and military network
    which had planned the coup d’état to overthrow the regime. Two months
    later, the organization Neghab, in a communiqué, claimed responsibility
    for this attempted ‘uprising.’ The Organization attested that ‘the path of
    Mossadegh is that of the people’ and today ‘Bakhtiar is its authentic
    leader… We have risen up to put an end to this curse [the Islamic regime]
    and to entrust the affairs of our land to the faithful disciple of
    Mossadegh – Shapur Bakhtiar’” (Iran: In Defense of Human Rights, National
    Movement of the Iranian Resistance, Paris, 1983). Following the discovery
    of the plan for the coup, more than sixty officers and civilians were
    executed in several cities of Iran in less than a month. Most of the
    officers were still active in the army and had not been swept away in the
    first wave of purges which took place in the army after the fall of the
    monarchy. Executions of individuals involved in the Nojeh coup continued
    in the months and years to come; at least 200 persons were executed in
    relations to the coup. Nureddin Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh
    Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet communist party) mentioned the coup d’état
    in an article dated May 2, 2000 posted on the Rah-e Tudeh website. Kianuri
    stressed the fact that the military branch of the Tudeh Party, which
    cooperated with the Islamic Republic’s authorities, discovered and
    “neutralized” the above mentioned Organization as well as other groups
    that planned a coup against the newly established regime. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Tavakoli was arrested in his house in Tehran in January
    1981. The Revolutionary Guards came to his house around 8 p.m. and
    arrested Mr. Tavakoli, locked up the rest of the family in a room, and
    searched the house. They left the next morning, having taken his documents
    and valuables. Mr. Tavakoli was detained for about one year at Evin
    prison, section 129. According to available information, he spent the
    majority of his detention in solitary confinement, and did not have any
    visits with his family. His family was unaware of his whereabouts for 7
    months, until the Red Cross contacted them. Mr. Tavakoli was allowed a
    two-minute phone conversation with his family, saying that he would never
    return. Trial Mr. Tavakoli was tried at a court martial. No information is
    available about the proceedings and court sessions. Charges According to
    the available information, Mr. Tavakoli was charged with “involvement with
    the Nojeh coup.” In his indictment the Public Prosecutor said the
    following regarding some other participants of this alleged coup d’état
    plan: “These enthusiasts of the Shah’s rotten, filthy, and reactionary
    regime, these supporters of the blood-thirsty American imperialism, had in
    mind to bring ‘American social democracy’ as a gift to the liberated
    people of Iran. They had in mind to re-asses the opinion of our heroic
    nation about the return of the royal system through a referendum […].” He
    added: “This conspiracy was not planned in a vacuum and hence cannot be
    described in a single indictment; and these conspirators cannot be
    considered ordinary convicts. They are criminals who have undermined the
    newly regained truth, honor, and dignity of a liberated community of
    Muslim people. Considering that and by consulting the holy verses of the
    Koran regarding the punishment of the ‘rebel’ against the Islamic
    sovereign, it is imperative that the convicts receive their punishment
    according to the Shari’a law.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
