    The information about Mr. Ahmad Mostajab, born in Abadan, has been sent to
    Omid by a relative through an electronic form. The execution of Mr.
    Mostajab, along with two other individuals, was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami Daily on April 20, 1982, quoting the public relations department of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor’s Office of Esfahan. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendants’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial There is no information regarding this trial other
    than Mr. Mostajab was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Esfahan. Charges Mr. Mostajab was charged with “the sale of a total amount
    of 1500 kg opium, having a criminal record and previous arrests regarding
    drug offenses, other activities… [including] the sale of 206 kg opium” and
    “extensive activities in the distribution of narcotic drugs to the point
    of endangering the health of society.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of
    the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. The
    sender of the electronic form states that there was no evidence against
    Mr. Mostajab. Defense No information is available concerning Mr.
    Mostajab’s defense. According to the available information, he was denied
    the right to have an attorney or access to his file. He was not allowed to
    appeal against the court verdict. The sender of the electronic form states
    that he only helped individuals, who wanted to flee Iran, leave the
    country. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Esfahan sentenced
    Mr. Ahmnad Mostajab to death. The sentence was confirmed by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Qom. He was shot by a firing squad in Golestan
    district of Shiraz.
