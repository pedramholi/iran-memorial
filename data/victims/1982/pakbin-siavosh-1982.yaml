    The news of the execution of Mr. Siavosh Pakbin, along with that of 60
    others, was released by the Public Relations of the General Prosecutor's
    Office in a communiqué published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on October 6,
    1981. The communiqué, which specifies that those executed were “members
    and sympathizers of the anti-people groups who had risen against Islam and
    the Qur'an”, begins as follows: “By purging the corruptors, clean the
    earth from corruption (Qur'an Karim). Those who have not embraced faith
    and are combating in an idolatrous path are forming rank against pious
    people, and, by martyring the best and purest men, are attesting to the
    fact that they are mercenaries of the great powers. It is the duty of you
    pious men to stand up against them and uproot infidelity and hypocrisy.”
    Additional information about Mr. Pakbin was drawn from a list of 12028
    individuals published in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges There
    is no mention of the charges brought against this defendant. The General
    Prosecutor's Office does, however, provide specific charges against one of
    the 61 individuals named in the communiqué: "It must be noted that
    Mohammad Kazem Golzadeh Ghafuri was directly involved in the attack
    against the Majlis [parliament] during which he had opened fire on the
    revolutionary guards in charge of the Majlis shuraye Eslami. He was an
    active member of the military teams of the Monafeqin [Hypocrites, term
    used by the Islamic Republic authorities when referring to the People’s
    Mojaheddin Organization] and had also a role in the unsuccessful
    assassination attempt on Mr. Hojatolesalm Khaz'ali and Hojatoleslam Musavi
    Tabrizi, the General Prosecutor of the Revolution." The communiqué notes
    that all the other defendants were members and sympathizers of groups that
    it does not identify but refers to as “anti-people groups.” The charges
    against these groups, as specified in the communiqué, are as follows: "
    [rising] against Islam and the Qur'an by participating in armed
    demonstrations and clashes with the Revolutionary Guards, imposing
    martyrdom on people who are faithful to the revolution, being present in
    safe houses, identifying and assassinating known clerics and state
    dignitaries, carrying arms and grenades to oppose defenseless people,
    taking action in order to blow up various centers, and being involved in
    armed carjacking and bank robberies." Evidence of guilt The statement
    issued by the Prosecutor’s Office does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the accused’s defense. Judgment Based on the Public
    Prosecutor’s Office communiqué, the defendant was sentenced to death for
    being “rebellious against Islam”, “an enemy of God”, and “a corruptor on
    earth.” The sentence was carried out at dawn in the courtyard of the
    Prison.
