    1982) newspapers as well as articles published in the Archives of Baha i
    Persecution in Iran (ABPI) . Additionally, information was obtained from a
    statement by the chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha
    is of the United States (Religious Persecution of the Baha'is in Iran:
    Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Human Rights and International
    Organizations of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of
    Representatives, Ninety-eighth Congress, Second Session, May 2, 1984) (
    Hearing ). Dr. Zia ollah Ahrari was born in Surmaq, (near Abadeh, Fars
    Province) on January 1st 1934 (ABPI, Bio and Kayhan, November 22nd 1982).
    After finishing his secondary studies in Abadeh, he moved to Italy to
    complete a PhD in Pharmacology (ABPI, Bio). He was the head of Hafez
    pharmacy associated with Shiraz University Medical School s Hospital,
    based on a letter from the hospital s head of psychiatry dated December
    30, 1981. The letter addressed to the Dr. Gharib, Head of the Medical
    School, requested that Dr. Ahrari s efforts to respond to patients need
    for Lithium Carbonate tablets be acknowledged and encouraged. Dr. Ahrari
    was a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Shiraz and, based on the
    information published in Iran s media, a member of its Pioneering and
    Support Committee. ( Ettelaat (November 25th, 1982) Mr. Ahrari is also one
    of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report documents the persecution of Baha i s
    in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists members killed since 1978.
    Additional information has been drawn from various issues of the The Baha
    i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. The Baha is in
    the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979 (1) - to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence. (2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Baha i National Spiritual Assembly After the
    Islamic Revolution In the organizational structure of the Baha i
    community, the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly is a body
    composed of nine individuals that are elected annually with the votes of
    adult Baha is in each country. This institution tends to the affairs and
    issues of the Baha i community on the national level. The National
    Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of guiding, coordinating, and
    moving forward the activities of each country s local spiritual
    assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl ( House of Justice
    ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the highest
    decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I s
    Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual
    assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz,
    were severely persecuted and the majority of their members were executed.
