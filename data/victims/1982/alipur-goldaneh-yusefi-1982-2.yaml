    Ms. Yusefi was born a Moslem but had converted to Baha ism prior to the
    February 1979 Islamic Revolution. The persecution of Ms. Yusefi and her
    family began in the aftermath of the Revolution. Information regarding the
    murder of Ms. Goldaneh (also spelled " Guldanih") Yusefi (Alipur) was
    obtained from the Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran website (June 18,
    2020) and Mr. Adel Shafipur s account in Andalib magazine (Volume 33,
    Winter 1990). Additional information was obtained from Radio Zamaneh, an
    interview with Ms. Badi i, a Baha i adherent from Mazandaran Province who
    wrote her college thesis regarding the history of Baha ism in the village
    of Roshan Kuh in Mazandaran Province. (October 4, 2008). Ms. Yusefi was
    born in Sari County s village of Sadat Mahalleh, located in Mazandaran
    Province in a Moslem family. He married a Baha i man and had three
    children. They were farmers and livestock breeders. Ms. Yusefi was a
    Moslem until the age of 45. Although she did not adhere to the Baha i
    faith, she raised her children based on Baha i principles and tenets. Ms.
    Yusefi converted to the Baha i faith in early 1978. In the aftermath of
    the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Ms. Yusefi, her husband, and her family were
    persecuted, discriminated against, and even beaten by Moslems on numerous
    occasions. According to an eyewitness, Ms. Yusefi s home was attacked by
    the inhabitants of surrounding villages on numerous occasions: I saw these
    savage, cruel, and inhuman acts to a certain extent. For instance, I saw
    with my own eyes how a small number of [people] would attack this helpless
    and innocent [family] and would beat these dear people every morning and
    night; they even burnt a section of the lower body of that dear lady s
    grandchild, who was 11 years old, with cigarettes. They even harassed and
    persecuted her dear husband once, to get him to renounce and curse the
    Divine Faith; however, when that [courageous and] kind man refused, they
    urinated on that holy old man as they insulted him, severely beat him
    again and leaving him for dead. (Andalib magazine). In early summer of
    1982, several of the inhabitants of the adjacent village mounted an attack
    on Ms. Yusefi s home in her village, proceeded to severely beat her and
    her family, break their doors and windows, and forced them to leave that
    village. After that attack, Ms. Yusefi s family took refuge in the village
    of Roshan Kuh and took up residence there. Mr. Yusefi is also one of the
    206 individuals whose name was published in the Worldwide Baha i Community
    s 1999 report. This report, entitled Iran s Secret Blueprint for the
    Destruction of a Religious Community , deals with the persecution of
    members of the Baha i faith in Iran by the Islamic Republic, and contains
    a list of Baha is who were killed in Iran since 1979. The Baha is in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The Baha i religious community is the
    largest minority group in Iran, with approximately 300,000 members in 1979
    (more current figures are not available).* The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected Baha is religious to systematic harassment and
    persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The
    Baha i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic
    Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result,
    the Baha is have been denied the rights associated with the status of a
    religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith and are
    banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice
    has subjected them to abuse and violence.** Ms. Yusefi s Death According
    to available information, at 3 o clock in the afternoon of December 24,
    1982, Ms. Goldaneh Yusefi (Alipur) was attacked by three local people when
    she was alone in her home. The attackers strangled Ms. Yusefi and
    proceeded to set her body and her home on fire. According to Ms. Yusefi s
    grandchild, at the time of the incident, three individuals from Sadat
    Mahalleh named Seyed Mohammad Andarajani, Goldaneh s nephew (her sister s
    son), Dustali Yusefi, another nephew (her brother s son), and Hossein
    Fazlinejad, Dustali Yusefi s brother-in-law (his wife s brother), beat
    Goldaneh with wooden sticks. Then they strangled her with a rope and
    wrapped her in a blanket, poured gasoline on her dead body and burnt her,
    and finally set fire to the plastic tent they lived in with all of their
    belongings inside. (Radio Zamaneh). Officials Reaction Following a
    complaint lodged by Ms. Yusefi s son, several police officers from the
    town of Kiasar s police precinct, as well as the medical examiner, went to
    the scene of the crime and examined the body and the location, after which
    the medical examiner issued a death certificate and burial permit. The
    revolutionary court did not prosecute this murder, however, stating that
    there were no eyewitnesses present at the time of Ms. Yusefi s murder.
    (Andalib magazine). Ms. Yusefi s killers were detained in jail for 25 days
