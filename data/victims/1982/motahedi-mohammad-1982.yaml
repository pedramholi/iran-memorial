circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Motahedi, along with another defendant, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami Daily on January 30, 1982. Mr. Mohammad
    Motahedi (Forqan) is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Forqan was formed in 1977 by a group of Ali Shari
    ati s followers with a modern interpretation of the Qoran and Islamic
    ideology. It is not clear whether or not the group was armed, but it went
    underground soon after its formation. Based on documents available in the
    archives of the Islamic Revolution Documentation Center (gathered and
    reported by Ahmad Gudarzi on Bacheha-ye Ghalam website), this group
    opposed from the onset of the Revolution the involvement of the clergy in
    the government and the particular interpretation of Islam later
    implemented by the Islamic Republic authorities. In its short period of
    post-revolutionary activity, the group was accused of involvement in
    several assassinations and armed robberies, the first one reportedly as
    early as May 1979, only a couple of months after the triumph of the
    Revolution. Based on the above mentioned report, most of the known members
    of the group were executed or killed in clashes with Islamic Revolutionary
    Committee forces, which led to the total elimination of the group in
    January 1980. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Motahedi s trial. Charges Mr. Motahedi was reported to be a highly
    active member and the head of the Forqan group who had participated in the
    assassinations of the political and religious figures, such as the
    assassination of Ayatollah Qazi, the attempted assassination of
    Hojatalislam Khamenei, bombing at the Azam Mosque in Qom and the attempted
    assassination of Hojatalislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of the
    Iranian Islamic Parliament. Evidence of guilt According to this report,
    Mr. Motahedi confessed to his actions after he was arrested. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Motahedi s defense. Judgment The report
    specified that Mr. Motahedi was hanged in public but did not mention the
    tribunal that issued his death sentence.
