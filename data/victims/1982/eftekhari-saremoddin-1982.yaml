    Mr. Saremoddin Eftekhari is one of the 430 Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr. Eftekhari
    is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on
    September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr.
    Eftekhari s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Eftekhari s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Saremodin Eftekhari was executed by firing squad in Sanandaj
    in March of 1982. He was 24 years old.
