    The information about Mr. Alireza Zarifi Bamian Chubdari is taken from an
    interview conducted on September 5, 2006 with one of his friends. He was
    born in Tehran, was a high school graduate and a sympathizer of the
    Fadayian Khalq Organization (Minority). When he was serving in the
    military in Ajabshir, he took two guns and escaped the garrison. He gave
    the guns to the military division of the Fadaiyan Organization and went
    underground. His main activity was to distribute the publications of the
    Organization in southern quarters of Tehran. The Fadayian Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over the support to the Islamic Republic and to the Soviet Union. The
    Fadayian Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was mainly active
    in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. In
    the fall of 1981, Mr. Zarifi Bamian Chubdari went to his mother's
    residence for a visit. The Revolutionary Guards were waiting for him
    around the house and arrested him. They took him to the Evin prison. The
    interviewee quotes the Mr. Zarifi Bamian Chubdari’s mother saying that
    after entreating Lajvardi (the Public Prosecutor and the Head of the Evin
    prison) she was able to visit her son once for a few minutes. During this
    visitation, her son rolled up his shirt and showed her his back that was
    black and blue from torture. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Zarifi
    Bamian Chubdari's charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defence No information is available about the defendant’s
    defence. Judgment No specific information is available about the
    defendant’s execution. Mr. Zarifi Bamian Chubdari was executed in the Evin
    prison in the winter of 1982. Three weeks after his visitation with his
    mother, his father went to the Evin prison to see him. But, the prison
    authorities gave him a bag and informed him of his son's execution. His
    father went to the Khavaran cemetery to find his burial site. A grave
    digger told him that Alireza was buried along with 10 other people
    collectively.
