    Mr. Asghar Mohkami is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were either executed or
    killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June
    20, 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Additional information
    about Mr. Mohkami was sent to the Boroumand Foundation through an
    electronic form by a person familiar with this case. According to this
    information, Mr. Mohkami was born in Kangavar in 1949. He was married and
    had a son. Mr. Mohkami graduated from Tehran University with a philosophy
    major and used to be a teacher before being expelled. He was a sympathizer
    of the MKO and a political prisoner during the Pahlavi regime. The
    following information about Mr. Mohkami came from the MKO website.
    According to this website, Mr. Mohkami was active in MKO public relations,
    the Taleqani publications, street discussions and proselytization. He
    participated in the MKO meetings and chanted slogans before speeches. Mr.
    Mohkami went underground after the June 20, 1981 demonstration* and was on
    his way to Kordestan province to a new MKO mission when he was killed.
    According to this website, on November 4, 1982, while visiting his aunt s
    house, around the Fourth Square of Tehran Pars, Mr. Mohkami was identified
    and shot to death by the members of the Revolutionary Guards. Mr. Asghar
    Mohkami s name is in Omid along with victims of violations of human rights
    by the Islamic Republic of Iran, because in 1981 and 1982 there were
    numerous cases where the government agents shot at unarmed individuals as
    they attempted escape and caused their death. The MKO was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the
    closure of their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the
    Islamic Republic authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened
    the gap between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the
    Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime
    attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and
    while distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO
    supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration
    protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the government
    officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr.
    Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration illegal,
    thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary
    Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from
    this demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were
    arrested and executed in the following days and weeks. The day after the
    demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a repressive campaign
    unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and
    sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO
    announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and assassinated
    a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the Islamic regime.
    In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the impeached President
    (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they founded the National
    Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many of its members were
    expelled from France, they went to Iraq and founded t
