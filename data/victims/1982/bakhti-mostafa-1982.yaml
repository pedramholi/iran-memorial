    The information about Mr. Mostafa Bakhti has been sent to Omid by an
    individual familiar with this case. Additional information has been drawn
    from The Tudeh Martyrs , the Tudeh Publication, 2002. He is one of
    hundreds of individuals who were extrajudicially executed since the 1979
    Revolution. In many cases, these killings were carried out by agents of
    the Islamic Republic or can reasonably be assumed to be the result of the
    Iranian government policy. Mr. Bakhti was a high school teacher employed
    by the Ministry of Education in Khoramabad (Lorestan province). According
    to the Tudeh book, he started his political activism in opposition to the
    previous regime and consequently was detained for two months, during which
    he became interested in the Tudeh Party. He was threatened due to his
    affiliation with this Party. According to the sender of the electronic
    form, Mr. Bakhri was stabbed on a street in Khoramabad. However, the Tudeh
    book quotes a friend stating that a few individuals of the Party of God (
    Hezbollah ) shot him in his house in 1982. According to this friend, these
    persons cautioned the Bakhti family against holding memorial services for
    Mr. Mostafa Bakhti. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh
    Party ideology was Marxist- Leninist and it supported policies of the
    former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran s political
    scene until it was banned for the second time following the August 19,
    1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah
    Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party s leaders and members
    were imprisoned. Arrest and detention According to the available
    information, Mr. Bakhti was not arrested after the 1979 Revolution. Trial
    Mr. Bakhti was not summoned before a court, and no public trial was held
    in this case. Whether a court condemned him to death in absentia is not
    known. Charges No specific charges were legally brought against Mr.
    Bakhti. Evidence of guilt The report on this assassination does not
    mention any evidence. Defense Mr. Bakhti was not given the opportunity to
    defend himself in a court of law before being killed. Judgment No
    information is available about a possible sentence leading to this
    extrajudicial execution.
