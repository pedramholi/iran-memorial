    Ms. Fatemeh (Farzaneh) Urmazdi is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in
    an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were either executed or
    killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June
    20, 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The information about
    Ms. Urmazdi, who was executed along with 70 other individuals, is taken
    from the website of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). She was born
    in Tehran. She had a Bachelor degree in Agriculture Management from the
    Ghazali College in Qazvin and was a sympathizer of the MKO. She was active
    in the Moslem Students Association of the Dehkhoda University at Qazvin
    and also a member of the Moslem Youth Association. She participated in the
    MKO demonstrations and after June 20, 1981, like other militia members of
    this organization, she went underground. Arrest and detention According to
    the MKO website, Ms. Urmazdi was identified by the Revolutionary Guards in
    the streets in 1981. When she tried to escape, she was shot in leg. The
    Guards arrested her and took her to the hospital. On March 8, 1982, she
    was first transferred to Karaj clinic and then to the Evin prison. Because
    of her injured leg, she couldn't walk and was forced to use a wheelchair.
    She was reportedly tortured severely for nine months. It is also reported
    that she was raped before her execution. The Ms. Urmazdi s arrest was
    connected to the demonstration of June 20, 1981. This demonstration was in
    protest against the parliament's impeachment of President Banisadr and the
    Islamic Republic's systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) from politics, along with the Ayatollah Khomeini s
    refusal of to meet with MKO leaders and his desire to neutralize the party
    s influence. Up until that day, the MKO had supported the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function within the framework of the new
    political system. However, on June 20th, the MKO officially changed its
    policy and tried to overthrow the regime by organizing mass demonstrations
    throughout the country. These demonstrations were severely suppressed and
    resulted in the killing of dozens of demonstrators. It was followed by a
    wave of mass arrests and executions by the Revolutionary Guards and
    para-military forces that targeted the MKO and all other opposition
    groups. The massive repression, unprecedented in the history of the
    Islamic Republic, legitimized the months-old state harassment and
    suppression of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of
    independent political dissent. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges No information is available on Ms. Urmazdi s
    charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Ms. Urmazdi's defense. Judgment No specific information is
    available about this execution. Ms. Urmazdi was executed by a firing squad
    in Evin prison on October 25, 1982.
