    Mr. Sa’di Ma’dandar is one of the 430 individuals whose name appears on
    the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list
    contains the names of those members of the Organization who died after the
    Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Additional information has been drawn from the Peykargar
    magazine (the publication of the Union of Peykargar Students for the
    Liberation of the Working Class, No. 11, Aug./Sep. 1987), and an
    electronic form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. Mr.
    Ma’dandar was born in 1960 in a city near Karaj (Tehran province) into a
    laborer’s family (electronic form). He became a member of the Peykar
    Organization and was known as Nader. He was initially a political activist
    near Qazvin, and in 1981 he was transferred to the north of the country (
    Peykargar). The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention Mr. Ma’dandar was arrested in late January
    1982 in Gilan province (Peykar website and electronic form). The details
    of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr.
    Ma’dandar is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ma’dandar’s defense.
    Judgment According to the Peykar reports, Mr. Sa’di Ma’dandar was executed
    (buried alive) on February 1, 1982 in Noshahr (Mazandaran province).
    However, the sender of the electronic form states that the location of
    execution was Bandar Anzali (Gilan province).
