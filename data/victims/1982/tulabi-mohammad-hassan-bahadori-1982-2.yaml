    The information about Mr. Mohammadhassan Bahadori-Tulabi, son of Mehrali a
    well-known landlord in Lorestan, was sent to Omid by a person familiar
    with his case though electronic forms. Mr. Bahadori-Tulabi was born in
    Khorramabad (in the western province of Lorestan) on May 28, 1958. He was
    married and had a high school diploma. After the revolution, he and his
    comrades published an underground publication named Pariskeh. He was a
    member of the Left Faction of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization Majority
    branch in Lorestan. This group ultimately joined the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Minority Organization. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist
    group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of
    Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. In 1981, the organization, which had opted for open
    political and electoral activity after the revolution, split over the
    critique of the concept of urban guerilla warfare and the support of the
    Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority
    opposed the Islamic Republic, and though it did not abandon the theory of
    armed struggle, its activities were mainly limited to the political arena
    and the labor movement. Following the Mojahedin Khalq Organization s June
    21st declaration of armed struggle, the Fadaiyan announced the
    organization of combatant cells. However, based on available information,
    these cells did not become operational. Many of the groups members and
    supporters were arrested and executed in the early 1980 s. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Bahadori-Tulabi was arrested in Garazkol village, near
    Khorramabad, during a memorial service for Siamak Asadian in November
    1981. The latter was a member of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization Minority,
    who was killed in 1981 in an armed confrontation. According to the
    electronic form report, the person in charge of his arrest, Tavakol
    Mostafazadeh, has been quoted saying: We were looking for you in the skies
    but find you here! Mr. Bahadori-Tulabi had no visitation with his family.
    Just before his execution he was able to talk with his family over the
    phone for three minutes. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges The official charge brought against Mr.
    Bahadori-Tulabi is not known. However, according to the electronic form,
    he was charged for attempting to overthrow the government. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Bahadori-Tulabi s defense. He was denied a defense
    attorney. Judgment Mr. Bahadori-Tulabi was shot by firing squad in the
    Evin prison in Tehran on February 3, 1981. He was 23 years old.
