    The information about Mr. Bijan Nasir Khaledi, son of Nosratollah, was
    gathered from an interview with a relative. Mr. Nasir Khaledi was born in
    May 1962 in Sanandaj. In the summer of 1979, an internal armed conflict
    broke out in the region, between some armed oppositional groups and
    security forces of the Islamic Republic. After this incident, Mr. Nasir
    Khaledi and his family moved to Tehran. In 1981, they returned to their
    house in Sanandaj. He home-schooled himself and he graduated from high
    school in the spring of 1981 with very good grades. He was hoping to
    enroll in Kordestan University and study in a technical field. According
    to the interviewee, he was mature for his age, and was very smart. His
    family and friends predicted that he would have a brilliant and successful
    future. According to information available, Mr. Nasir Khaledi was a
    sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khlaq Organization, Majority Branch. His older
    brother, Mr. Hushang Nasir Khaledi, was executed in February of 1982. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    After the 1979 Revolution, the organization, which renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority supported and considered the
    Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime. After the
    spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely
    because of their political beliefs. Arrest and detention The Revolutionary
    Guards arrested Mr. Nasir Khaledi in late June of 1981. The interviewee
    states that arrest without a warrant was the norm. The guards did not
    inform the family of his whereabouts after the arrest. With a lot of
    persistence, the family found out that he and his older brother, who had
    been arrested a few days before Bijan, were kept at the former SAVAK
    headquarters. (SAVAK was the National Intelligence and Security
    Organization of the Shah s regime.) In September 1981, the Nasir Khaledi
    brothers had their first visit with family members. However, they could
    not speak freely since they were under surveillance during the visit.
    According to the information available, they were both kept in a dirty
    room and were under constant interrogation. Trial Based on the information
    available, there was no public trial. His family was not aware of any
    trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Nasir Khaledi are not
    known. State officials referred to him as counter-revolutionary off the
    record. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against the accused. Defense No information is
    available concerning Mr. Nasir Khaledi s defense. The interviewee states
    that his charge was baseless. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the verdict leading to this execution. On November 3,
    1982, his family members went to the former SAVAK headquarters to visit
    Mr. Nasir Khaledi, but the prison officials told them that he was not
    there. After a few days, families of other prisoners informed the Nasir
    Khaledis that the bodies of those recently executed were buried at the
    Behesht-e Mohammadi cemetery in Sanandaj. They could not freely go to the
    cemetery since armed men prevented families from visiting the cemetery.
    The Nasir Khaledi family secretly went to the cemetery and found Bijan s
    clothes in a trash can. They believe that he was executed the same day
    they visited the prison. At the time of the execution, Bijan was 20 years
    old.
