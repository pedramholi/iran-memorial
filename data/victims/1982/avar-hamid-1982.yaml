    The information about Mr. Hamid Avar, son of Mohammad Sediq, was sent to
    Omid by a former cellmate via an electronic form. His execution along with
    8 other men was announced in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on February 7,
    1982. Arrest and detention The exact date of Mr. Avar’s arrest is not
    known. He was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards at Azadi square in
    Sanandaj, in the western province of Kordestan, for “membership in the
    militia of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.” He was reportedly torture in
    detention. He had visits with his family members. Trial Mr. Avar was tried
    at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kordestan in Sanandaj. Charges The
    newspaper reported that Mr. Avar and 8 other men were collectively charged
    with “armed insurrection against the Islamic Republic, participation in
    clashes in Sanandaj, participation in the Central Committees of the
    militia of Hypocrites [a name Iranian officials use when referring to the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization], the assassination of Muslims as well as
    bombing and destroying public places.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt Based
    on the information available, a report of the Revolutionary Guards was
    used against Mr. Avar. Defense No information is available on Mr. Avar’s
    defense. He was denied a defense attorney. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Kordestan called Mr. Avar “at war with God and his
    Prophet” and sentenced him to death. He was executed along with at least 5
    other men in February 1982 at the parking lot of the detention center of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Court, located on 22 Bahman Street, in Sanandaj.
