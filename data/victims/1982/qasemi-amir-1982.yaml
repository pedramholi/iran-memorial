    The execution of Mr. Amir Qasemi, along with twenty others, was announced

    Republic Public Prosecution Office and reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on March 3, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr.
    Qasemi was a repeat drug trafficker charged with being continuously
    involved in drug dealing for which he had been convicted 8 times. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against defendants cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Qasemi s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Section of
    the Public Prosecutor s Office sentenced Mr. Qasemi to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out.
    According to this communiqu , he was sentenced to life imprisonment during
    the previous regime and was a fugitive after the victory of the
    revolution, but became active once again. He was also pardoned several
    times.
