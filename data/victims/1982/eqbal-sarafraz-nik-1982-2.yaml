    The information about the execution of Mr. Sarafraz Nik Eqbal is drawn
    from an interview with an individual close to him. His execution was also
    announced in the Keyhan newspaper on September 27, 1982. Mr. Sarafraz Nik
    Eqbal was born in Sisakht (Kohgiluyeh va Boyer-Ahmad Province). He was
    married and had seven children (one of his children, Aziz Nik Eqbal, was
    executed in 2000). His occupation was agriculture and animal husbandry. He
    was a nationalist figure and a sympathizer of Dr. Shapur Bakhtiar. After
    the unsuccessful Nojeh coup, starting in 1981 he began an armed struggle
    along with other tribes against the Islamic Republic regime. On July 11,
    1980, the Islamic Republic of Iran authorities announced the discovering
    and dismantling of a civil and military network which had planned a coup
    d’état (known as the Nojeh coup) to overthrow the regime. Following this
    discovery, more than sixty officers and civilians were executed in several
    cities of Iran in less than a month. Most of the officers were still
    active in the army and had not been swept away in the first wave of purges
    which took place in the army after the fall of the monarchy. Two months
    later, the organization Neqab, in a communiqué, claimed responsibility for
    this attempted ‘uprising.’ Neqab attested that ‘the path of Mossadeq is
    that of the people’ and today ‘Bakhtiar is its authentic leader.’ The
    communiqué stated: “We have risen up to put an end to this curse (the
    Islamic regime) and to entrust the affairs of our land to the faithful
    disciple of Mossadeq—Shapur Bakhtiar” (Iran: In Defense of Human Rights,
    National Movement of the Iranian Resistance, Paris 1983). Nureddin
    Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet
    communist party) mentions the coup d’état in an article dated May 2, 2000
    (www.rahetudeh.com). Kianuri stresses the fact that the military branch of
    the Tudeh, which cooperated with the Islamic Republic authorities,
    discovered and “neutralized” the above mentioned organization as well as
    other groups that planned a coup against the newly established regime.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Sarafraz Nik Eqbal was arrested in the road
    between Firuzabad and Shiraz in the spring of 1982. First, he was taken
    him to Shiraz immediately transferred to Tehran. The location of his
    detention and interrogation is unknown. Before his execution, he was
    detained incommunicado for almost three months, during which he was denied
    the right to be represented by an attorney. Trial No specific information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges On September 27, 1982, the
    Keyhan newspaper published the following charges brought against Mr.
    Sarafraz Nik Eqbal: “mobilizing some locals and taking them to Tehran and
    Hamadan for military training, dressing as military personnel and leading
    some rebels, playing an active role in the coup and having continuous
    connections with the top leaders of the coup, receiving money for people
    who were involved in the coup and having connections with tribal and local
    elders in order to gather these people.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available about his defense. Judgment According to the Keyhan newspaper,
    Mr. Sarafraz Nik Eqbal was executed by a firing squad in Yasuj on
    September 27, 1982 at dawn. According to his relatives, his body was given
    to his family; however, the officials did not allow them to bury him in
    their garden. In order to avoid any gathering of the opposition by his
    grave, the officials selected a remote place near the mountain for his
    burial.
