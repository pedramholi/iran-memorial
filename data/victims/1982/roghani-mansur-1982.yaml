    The information about Mr. Mansur Roghani was obtained through an interview
    with a person close to him. He is also one of the 430 individuals whose
    names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va
    Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the organization
    who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on
    this list have been executed. Mr. Mansur Roghani was a fifth-year student
    in architecture at the School of Fine Arts in Paris. He was a member of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization until 1971 and then joined the
    Marxist-Leninist faction that branched out of that organization. Later he
    joined the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class. He
    was a political activist against the previous regime as well as the
    Islamic Republic. He was in charge of the Peykar publishing house at the
    time of his arrest. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Roghani was arrested on a street in Tehran in February 1981. He was kept
    at Evin prison and was detained for only 3 or 4 days, after which he was
    executed. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges Based on the available information, Mr. Roghani was charged with
    “apostasy and anti-revolutionary activities.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Roghani’s defense. He was denied the right to legal
    representation. Judgment Mr. Roghani was executed in February 1981 at Evin
    Prison. (Mr. Lajevardi, head of the prison, stated that that he was
    executed by firing squad). His body was not released to his family and he
    was buried in a mass grave in Khavaran Cemetery.
