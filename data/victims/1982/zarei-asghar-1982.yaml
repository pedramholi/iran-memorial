    The execution of Mr. Asghar Zareie was published in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on August 14, 1982, quoting the public relations of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Esfahan. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Zareie was
    reported to be charged with seducing, sodomizing and murdering a
    five-year-old child. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Zareie's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Esfahan
    sentenced Mr. Zareie to death. The sentence was carried out.
