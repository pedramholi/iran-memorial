    The information about Mr. Rostam Akbarpur Sarvestani was taken from an
    interview with a person close to him. He was born in Sarvestan (in Fars
    province) in 1962. He grew up in Shiraz and went to school there. After
    the 1979 revolution, he became interested in the Fadaiyan Khaq
    Organization. But later on, under the influence of his older brother and
    sister, he sympathized with the Ettehadieh Komonist-ha. He had a beautiful
    handwriting and wrote slogans on the walls in the streets. He also
    distributed leaflets of the Ettehadieh. In 1981, the Ettehadieh started
    holding military training for some of its members and sympathizers.
    Shortly prior to his arrest, Mr. Akbarpur Sarvestani, began military
    training. The Ettehadieh Komonist-ha was created by exiled opponents of
    the Pahlavi regime who mostly belonged to the Student Confederation. They
    followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung and did not believe in guerilla
    warfare. The group became marked by ideological divides during the periods
    preceding and following the 1979 revolution which caused it to split into
    several factions. One of the most important rifts was triggered by the
    decision by a number of members to take up arms and take over a city in
    Iran. The uprising plan, devised in the midst of an active and violent
    anti-communist campaign by the revolutionary Islamic government, split the
    Ettehadieh in two factions: one believing in the armed movement and the
    other opposing it. In the winter of 1982, armed members of the Ettehadieh
    hid in a forest in the North of Iran (Jangal in Farsi) outside the city of
    Amol. This group, also known as the Jangal group, was involved in several
    clashes with the Revolutionary guards and ultimately, on January 26,
    attacked the city of Amol hoping to generate a general uprising. The
    attempt to seize Amol failed. It is reported that a number of the group s
    members, revolutionary guards, and civilians were killed during the Amol
    clash. Subsequently, members of the Ettehadieh, including those who
    opposed the Amol uprising, were arrested and tried for belonging to the
    organization and for having participated in the Amol clash. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Akbarpur Sarvestani was arrested at 11 p.m. one night in the
    summer of 1981, in his house in Shiraz. The Revolutionary Guards did not
    provide the reason for his arrest. They entered the house by force and
    kicked all family members, who were sleeping at the time. Mr. Akbarpur
    Sarvestani's father was also arrested that night, so that he could provide
    information about Rostam's older brother and sister who were not home that
    night. Rostam's older brother was arrested soon after. On Wednesdays, Mr.
    Akbarpur Sarvestani had visits with his family. He also had a face-to-face
    visit with his older brother, who was also in prison. His younger sister
    saw his feet during a visit and she noticed that his toes were black, as a
    result of beatings or bastinado. Trial Mr. Akbarpur Sarvestani was tried
    in Shiraz. His father and other family memebrs were present at the trial.
    He and his brother were tried together. Charges The charge brought against
    the defendant is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense Mr. Akbarpur Sarvestani was denied a defense attorney.
    Judgment At the trial, the religious judge condemned Mr. Akbarpur
    Sarvestani to death, and his older brother to life imprisonment. His
    father was devastated and he begged the judge to pardon his son. Rostam,
    however, was calm. He reached into his pocket and gave the money he had to
    his family and ask them to divide it among the children in family. Mr.
    Akbarpur Sarvestani was executed in Shiraz in the winter of 1982. He was
    19 years old. His body was buried in the cemetery of Shiraz, in the
    section where executed individuals are buried. His family was not allowed
    to place a gravestone on his grave.
