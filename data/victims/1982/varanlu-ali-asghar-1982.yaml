    The execution of Mr. Ali Asghar Varanlu was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on March 15, 1982. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr.
    Varanlu was involved in drug business. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of
    the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Varanlu
    s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Neishabur
    sentenced Mr. Varanlu to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme
    Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out at dawn.
