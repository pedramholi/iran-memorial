    Mr. Mohammad Mashhadi Ja farlu (Forqan) is one of the 12028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Forqan was formed in 1977 by a group
    of Ali Shari ati s followers with a modern interpretation of the Qoran and
    Islamic ideology. It is not clear whether or not the group was armed, but
    it went underground soon after its formation. Based on documents available
    in the archives of the Islamic Revolution Documentation Center (gathered
    and reported by Ahmad Gudarzi on Bacheha-ye Ghalam website), this group
    opposed from the onset of the Revolution the involvement of the clergy in
    the government and the particular interpretation of Islam later
    implemented by the Islamic Republic authorities. In its short period of
    post-revolutionary activity, the group was accused of involvement in
    several assassinations and armed robberies, the first one reportedly as
    early as May 1979, only a couple of months after the triumph of the
    Revolution. Based on the above mentioned report, most of the known members
    of the group were executed or killed in clashes with Islamic Revolutionary
    Committee forces, which led to the total elimination of the group in
    January 1980. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Mashhadi Ja
    farlu s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Mashhadi Ja farlu s trial. Charges The charge brought
    against Mr. Mashhadi Ja farlu i is not known. Evidence of guilt The report
    of this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Mashhadi Ja farlu s defense. Judgment There is no information on the
    verdict leading to this execution.
