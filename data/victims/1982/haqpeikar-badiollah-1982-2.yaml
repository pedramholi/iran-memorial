    Mr. Badi'ollah Haqpeikar (also spelled "Badi'u'llah Haghpaykar") is one of
    the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report documents the persecution of the
    members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is
    killed since 1978. Additional information has been drawn from various
    issues of the The Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986,
    Haifa 1994. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979*- to systematic harassment and
    persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The
    Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic
    Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result,
    the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status of a
    religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are
    banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice
    has subjected them to abuse and violence.** Persecution of Baha is in Iran
    is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era
    that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself,
    supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and
    in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from
    France to Iran, in response to a question regarding political and
    religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government,
    Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they are harmful
    and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked
    another question: Will they be free to perform their religious rites? The
    Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i
    threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national security
    in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention
    No information is available on the circumstances of this defendant's
    arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on Mr. Haqpeikar's
    trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Haqpeikar are not known. Evidence
    of guilt No information is available on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Haqpeikar's defense.
    However, the representatives of the Baha'i community stress that their
    members are being persecuted for their religious beliefs. They note that
    Baha'is' requests to access their files are usually denied, and access to
    attorneys is often denied. They refute the validity of charges such as
    counter-revolutionary political activities or spying leveled against them
    in Iranian courts. They point out that the fundamental principles of their
    religion require them to show loyalty and obedience to their government
    and refrain from any political involvement. They believe that the
    accusation of espionage for Israel is unfounded and based solely on the
    fact that the Baha'i World Centre is in Israel. They point out that this
    centre was established on Mount Carmel in the late 19th century, long
    before the establishment of the State of Israel. Judgment This defendant
    was sentenced to death and executed. Baha'is have reported to human rights
    organizations that the text of sentences is often not communicated to
    them. _______________________ * Slow Death for Iran s Baha is by Richard
    N. Ostling, Time Magazine,20 February 1984. Also see The Persecution of
    the Baha is of Iran, 1844-1984, by Douglas Martin, Baha i Studies,volume
    12/13, 1984, p. 3. There is no information about the current number of
    Baha is in Iran. ** The Islamic Republic Penal Code grants no rights to
    Baha'is, and the courts have denied them the right to redress or to
    protection against assault, murder, and other forms of persecution and
    abuse. In so doing, the courts have treated Baha'is as unprotected
    citizens or "apostates," citing eminent religious authorities whose edicts
    are considered to be a source of law equal to acts of Parliament. The
    Founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, made execution a
    punishment for the crime of apostasy and decreed that a Muslim would not
    be punished for killing an apostate.
