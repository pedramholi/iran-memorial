    News of the execution of Mr. Ramin Sharifi was published on the websites
    of Radio Farda on December 8, 2003, Asreno on December 11, 2003, and the
    United States Foreign Ministry on November 3, 2005. Additional information
    was taken from an interview by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF
    Interview) with a person close to Mr. Sharifi. Mr. Sharifi was a Kurd, a
    single young man from the Merangevereh Village near Divandareh in
    Kurdistan. He had a middle-school education, was a Sunni and a member of
    the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan. (ABF interview) The Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with the goal to
    gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in north-western Iran. After the Revolution,
    conflicts between the new central Shiite government and mainly Sunni
    Kurdistan regarding the role of minorities in the drafting of the
    constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and
    particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in armed clashes between
    the Revolutionary Guards and the Peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The
    PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, 1979, when people went to polls
    to vote for or against the Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah
    Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan and declared it unofficial and
    illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke out and continued for several
    months in the region. By 1983, the PDKI had lost much of its influence in
    the region. In the years since various leaders of the PDKI have been
    assassinated. Following internal disputes, the party split in 2006 and two
    organizations were established as The Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan, and The Democratic Party of Kurdistan. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Sharifi was arrested by two security force agents at the Shanaz Quarter in
    Saqqez and transferred to the security forces headquarters in Saqqez on
    June 17, 2003 at 9 p.m. According to a person close to him, Mr. Sharifi
    planned to visit his sick mother, who suffered from cancer, and perform
    some political activities in Saqqez. The Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan sent him in company with two Peshmerga. (ABF interview) He was
    transferred to the detention center of the Intelligence Office in Saqqez
    and detained in solitary confinement under physical and psychological
    pressure, and he was tortured for two and a half months. During this
    period, he was denied any visitation or contact with his family. His
    family was able to visit him only once at the Intelligence Office
    courtyard when they saw marks of tortures on Mr. Sharifi s body including
    his broken nose and swelling face that made it difficult for them to
    recognize him. At the end of this period, Mr. Sharifi was transferred to
    the public prison in Saqqez. (ABF interview) Trial Branch One of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Saqqez tried Mr. Sharifi behind closed
    door. His attorney was present during the trial. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Sharifi
    were acts against national security by being a member of the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan and entering the country armed. (ABF interview)
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt According to a person close to him, the evidence
    presented against Mr. Sharifi in his trial was a Colt weapon and an extra
    magazine. (ABF interview) Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Sharifi s defense. Judgment Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Saqqez condemned Mr. Ramin Sharifi to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. (ABF interview) There is no detail information
    regarding this execution. Mr. Sharifi was hanged at the Saqqez Central
    Prison on December 7, 2003 at 12:30 p.m. His execution took place without
    legal process including a last visitation with his family, who were in
    Tehran at the time to follow up his case. His body was not returned to his
    family but was buried by officials at Behesht-e Mohammadi cemetery in
    Sanandaj. Mr. Sharifi s relatives identified his grave location and
    exhumed his body to verify his identity. (ABF interview)
