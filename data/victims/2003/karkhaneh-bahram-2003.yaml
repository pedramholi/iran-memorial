    News of the execution of Mr. Bahram Karkhaneh, son of Ali, was published
    in the Sharq newspaper on December 14, 2003, quoting the Public Relations
    Office of the Khuzestan Courthouse from the website of ISNA (Iranian
    Students News Agency), and in the Kayhan newspaper on December 9, 2003.
    His case was related to drug trafficking, drug possession, and an armed
    clash with officials. Arrest and detention Mr. Karkhaneh was detained for
    over a year. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Khuzestan tried Mr. Karkhaneh. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges According to the Sharq
    newspaper, the charge brought against Mr. Karkhaneh was announced as armed
    drug trafficking. However, according to the Kayhan newspaper, he was
    charged for transportation and possession of narcotics and murdering a
    soldier during an armed clash. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Karkhaneh. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Karkhaneh s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Khuzestan condemned Mr. Bahram Karkhaneh to death
    on December 24, 2002. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling on March 9,
    2003. He was hanged in public at Salman Farsi Street in Ahvaz on December
    6, 2003 at 8 a.m.
