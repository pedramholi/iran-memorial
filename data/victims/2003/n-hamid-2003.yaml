    News of the execution of Mr. Hamid N. was published in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on December 23, 2003, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Mahshahr Courthouse. His case was related to a murder. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Hamid N. was arrested after the victim s father filed a
    complaint against him. According to the victim s father, Mr. Hamid N. had

    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information
