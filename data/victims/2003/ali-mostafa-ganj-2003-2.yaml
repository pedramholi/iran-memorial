    News of the execution of Mr. Mostafa Ganj ali, son of Abolqasem, along
    with five others, was published on the website of ISNA (Iranian Students
    News Agency) on January 13, 2003 and in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    January 14, 2003. Arrest and detention Mr. Ganj ali was arrested following
    several reports regarding gang robberies from carpet stores across Tehran.
    The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    According to the Public Relations Office of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court, a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran tried Mr.
    Ganj ali. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Ganj ali were announced as dealing and possession of
    282 kilograms of opium and addiction to narcotics. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Ganj ali.
    According to the Public Relations Office of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court, he had a record for various charges related to dealing narcotics.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Ganj ali s defense. Judgment A
    branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Mostafa
    Ganj ali to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged, along with five others, in the presence of forensics
    representatives, police and court officials at Evin Prison in Tehran on
    January 9, 2003. No specific information is available about this
    execution.
