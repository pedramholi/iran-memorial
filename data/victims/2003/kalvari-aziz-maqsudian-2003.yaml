    News of the execution of Mr. Aziz Maqsudian Kalvari, along with another
    person, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on May 22, 2003,
    quoting the Public Relations Office of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts in
    Tehran. Arrest and detention Mr. Maqsudian Kalvari was arrested by
    security forces. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial A branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran tried
    Mr. Maqsudian Kalvari. No information is available on his trial. Charges
    The charges brought against Mr. Maqsudian Kalvari were announced as active
    participation in supply and distribution of narcotics, transportation and
    possession of two illegal combat weapons, and addiction to narcotics. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Maqsudian Kalvari included dealing a total of 128 kilograms
    and 625 grams of heroin, possession of 176 kilograms and 678 grams of
    heroin, and carrying and possession of two illegal combat weapons. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Maqsudian Kalvari s defense. Judgment A
    branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran condemned Mr. Aziz
    Maqsudian Kalvari to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He
    was hanged, along with another defendant, in public at the Lavizan Park in
    Tehran on May 20, 2003 at 8 a.m. No further information is available about
    this execution.
