    News of the execution of Mr. Behruz was published in the Iran newspaper on
    December 8, 2002 and March 3, 2003. Arrest and detention Mr. Behruz was
    arrested in connection with the murder of a young man. The circumstances
    of his arrest and detention are not known. According to the newspaper
    report, a young man who had married a few days earlier, was murdered on
    March 21, 2002. Police investigation indicated that a woman had loved the
    victim but he rejected her and married someone else. The woman married Mr.
    Behruz but sent several messages to the victim demanding not to marry
    ever. After police interrogation, the woman and her husband (Mr. Behruz)
    were arrested. Trial Branch Two of the Public Court of Sari tried Mr.
    Behruz in four sessions. No other information is available on his trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Behruz was announced as murder. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Behruz was his
    statements, his wife s statements, and the statements of the victim s
    family. During the trial, his wife stated: Behruz and I reviewed the plan
    for committing the crime . Then, Behruz went to the victim s house,
    brought him to the murder location, and began talking to him. I took the
    stick that I hid under my Manto (a long overall dress) and hit him on his
    forehead. Then I hit him again and ran towards my father s house. I don t
    know what happened next and how he was killed. Defense In his defense
    during the trial, Mr. Behruz said that his wife threatened him to get a
    divorce if he did not kill the victim. He stated: I was under tremendous
    pressure. I loved my wife and the fact that she lived with me when loving
    another man tortured me. On the night of the murder, contrary to the
    forensics report indicating 25 blows of a knife, I did not stab [the
    victim] more than five times. The victim was alive when I escaped. I
    really don t know who murdered him. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Behruz to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged
    in public in Sari on March 2, 2003.
