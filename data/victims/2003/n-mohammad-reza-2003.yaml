    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza N., along with another person,
    was published in the Kayhan newspaper on March 19, 2003. Arrest and
    detention Security forces in Lorestan arrested Mr. Mohammad Reza N. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Mohammad Reza N. s trial. Charges The
    charges brought against Mr. Mohammad Reza N. were announced as armed
    robbery and sedition. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the report, the evidence presented against Mr. Mohammad Reza
    N. was his confession. He and his collaborator had confessed to committing
    armed robberies, robbery, harassment, sedition, and acts incompatible with
    chastity. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Mohammad Reza N. s defense. Judgment A court condemned Mr. Mohammad
    Reza N. to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged, along with the other defendant of this case, in public at a square
    in Khoramabad on March 19, 2003 in the morning. No specific information is
    available about this execution.
