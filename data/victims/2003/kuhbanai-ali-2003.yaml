    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Kuhbana i was published on Isfahansite on
    May 26, 2003. Additional information regarding his arrest and prosecution
    was published in the Ettela at newspaper on July 31, 2000. Arrest and
    Detention According to the Ettela at newspaper, quoting the Commander of
    the Security Forces in Kerman, Mr. Kuhbana i and his collaborators were
    arrested based on cooperation between security forces in Kerman and
    Esfahan. They were transferred to the Intelligence Police in Esfahan. The
    report indicated that the date of arrest was kept confidential for
    investigative reasons to protect the police operation and prevent escapees
    from knowing it. Trial Branch Four of the Revolutionary Court tried Mr.
    Kuhbana i. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Kuhbana i were announced as "armed robbery, piracy, sedition,
    shooting at a Melli Bank agent in Kohandej Branch, carrying and possession
    of two Kalashnikovs, and having a criminal record." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Kuhbana i was his confession, and recovery
    of irrefutable documents at their hiding place. The contents of these
    documents were not disclosed. (Ettela at newspaper) International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Kuhbana i's defense. Judgment The court
    identified Mr. Ali Kuhbana i as Mohareb (fighter against God) and
    condemned him to death on September 24, 2001. The Supreme Court confirmed
    the ruling on September 7, 2002. He was hanged at the Rahnan Intersection
    in Esfahan on May 25, 2003.
