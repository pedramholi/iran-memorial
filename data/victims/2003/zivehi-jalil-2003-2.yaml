    News of the execution of Mr. Jalil Ziveh i was published on the websites
    of Radio Farda on December 8, 2003, quoting the Speaker of the Kurdish
    Democratic Party of Iran, and Asrema on December 11, 2003, quoting the
    Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran s announcement. Additional information
    was taken from a phone interview by the Boroumand Foundation with a person
    close to Mr. Ziveh I (ABF Interview). According to this report, he was a
    Sunni Kurd, single, and from Sardasht. He had a primary education and
    worked as a businessperson. The Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI)
    was founded in 1945 with the objective to gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in
    north-west Iran. After the Revolution, conflicts between the new central
    Shiite government and mainly Sunni Kurdistan regarding the role of
    minorities in the drafting of the constitution, specification of Shiite as
    the official state religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region,
    ended in armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and the Peshmerga
    (the militia of the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1,
    1979 when people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime.
    On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan
    and declared it unofficial and illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke
    out and continued for several months. By 1983, PDKI had lost much of its
    influence in the region. Various leaders of the PDKI have been
    assassinated. Arrest and detention According to the Radio Farda report,
    Mr. Ziveh i was injured and arrested by Revolutionary Guards near a
    village in Mahabad in September of 1994. He was detained at prisons in
    Sardasht, Mahabad, and Orumieh for nine years without access to an
    attorney (ABF Interview). According to the Speaker of the Kurdish
    Democratic Party of Iran, he was arrested for his activities in the party,
    including the secret distribution of its publications and newspapers.
    According to him, Mr. Ziveh i had been tortured by the security forces
    after his arrest (Radio Farda report). Trial No information is available
    on Mr. Ziveh i s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Ziveh i
