    News of the execution of Mr. A. SH., along with four others, was published
    in the Iran, Jomhuri Eslami, and Khorasan newspapers on April 17, 2003.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. A. SH. s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. A. SH. s
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. A. SH. was announced as
    murder. He was accused of murdering an individual named as M. (Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper) The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. A. SH. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. A. SH. s defense. Judgment A court condemned Mr. A. SH. to death.
    The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and the Head of Judiciary validated
    it. He was hanged in Qasr Prison on April 17, 2003. No specific
    information is available about this execution.
