    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Reza, without his last name, was
    published in the Ettela at newspaper on February 24, 2003. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Ali Reza s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Ali Reza s trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Ali Reza was announced as murder. He was
    accused of murdering a person named Ebrahim Gachkar in Bandar-e Anzali in
    1996. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences, against their opponents (including political, civil society
    activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each
    year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Ali Reza. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Ali Reza s defense. Judgment A court condemned Mr. Ali Reza to death. He
    was hanged in public and in the presence of the victim s family at
    Bibihurieh Square in Bandar-e Anzali on February 23, 2003. No specific
    information is available about this execution.
