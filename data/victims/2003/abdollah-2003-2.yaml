    News of the execution of Mr. Abdollah, without his last name, was
    published in the Ettela at newspaper on March 3, 2003. His case was
    related to drug trafficking. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Abdollah s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Abdollah s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr.
    Abdollah was announced as drug trafficking. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Abdollah was
    possession of one kilogram and 238 grams of heroin. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Abdollah s defense. Judgment A court condemned Mr.
    Abdollah to death. He was hanged in the presence of judicial authorities
    in Kangan in early 2003. No specific information is available regarding
    this execution.
