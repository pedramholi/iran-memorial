    News of the execution of Mr. Sa id Rafi i, along with another person, was
    published in the E temad newspaper on July 31, 2003. Additional
    information regarding his arrest and prosecution was taken from the Ettela
    at newspaper of May 23, 2001 and the Iran newspaper of November 6, 2001.
    Arrest and detention According to the E temad newspaper, following the
    recovery of two bodies in a villa in Tehran on May 3, 2001, police
    investigators found out that a gardener, who used to work at this place,
    had been seen at the location a few days earlier. After face drawing and
    finding his residence in Hamadan, police identified his location and
    arrested Mr. Rafi i. Trial No information is available on Mr. Rafi i s
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Rafi i was announced as
    murder. According to the E temad newspaper, after murdering the residents
    of the villa, he stole money, gold, and valuables, and went to the
    Kabudarahang Village. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Rafi i was his confession. According to the E temad newspaper,
    during the interrogation, he stated that following his acquaintance with
    the property owner he went to the house, murdered the owner and his
    sister, and left with 72 thousand Tumans on May 1, 2001. International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Rafi i s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Sa id Rafi i to death (two counts) and two years
    imprisonment. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at
    Qasr Prison in Tehran on July 30, 2003.
