    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Sa adat Fath, along with three
    others, was published in the Iran newspaper and on the Hadeseh website on
    February 1, 2003, and in the Ma vi newspaper on February 5, 2003.
    According to these reports, he was the leader of a gang of four who
    allegedly kidnapped and raped young women. Arrest and Detention According
    to the existing information, Mr. Sa adat Fath was arrested at a phone
    kiosk in Hamid town when making a phone call to a victim s house on
    December 8, 2002. His interrogation revealed that three other members of
    this group lived in Qom. By the order of a judge of the Public Court of
    Arak, police arrested these three individuals. (Iran newspaper) Trial
    According to the Iran and Ma vi newspaper, Branch 25 of the Public Court
    in Arak tried Mr. Sa adat Fath; however, according to the Hadeseh website,
    Branch Two of the Arak Courthouse tried him. Charges The charges against
    Mr. Sa adat Fath and his collaborators were collectively announced as
    "kidnapping young girls, robbing their belongings, and raping them with
    force and intimidation." Members of this gang picked up girls as
    passengers in their car, took them to a location outside the city
    threatening with a knife, and raped them. Then, they stole their victims
    gold and money and released them. (Iran newspaper) The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Sa adat Fath was his confession, the
    confession of his collaborators, and complaints by plaintiffs.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Sa adat Fath s
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad Sa adat Fath to death
    and Branch 32 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at
    the Qa m Maqam Farahani Square in Arak on January 30, 2003.
