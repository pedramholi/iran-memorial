    News of the execution of Mr. Mehdi, without his last name, along with two
    others, was published in the Iran newspaper on August 31, 2003. His case
    and the cases of two other defendants were related to drug trafficking.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Mehdi and the other two defendants were
    identified and arrested by Narcotics Agents in Karaj, while attempting to
    transport narcotics from Zahedan to Tehran, in April of 2002. He was
    detained for 17 months. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial Branch Four of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Karaj
    tried Mr. Mehdi. No information is available on his trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Mehdi and the two other defendants was
    collectively announced as drug trafficking. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Mehdi and
    the other two defendants was recovery of four kilograms of heroin hidden
    in a tea flask when arrested, and possession of 16 kilograms of heroin.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Mehdi s defense. Judgment
    Branch Four of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Karaj condemned Mr.
    Mehdi to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged,
    along with two others, at Qezelhesar Prison in Karaj on August 21, 2003.
