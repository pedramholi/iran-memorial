    News of the execution of Mr. Mohsen Ranjbar was published in the Sharq
    newspaper on December 17, 2003. He was married and his case was related to
    the murder of a 60-year-old woman and her granddaughter at the Nikabad
    Village in Esfahan on December 18, 2000. Arrest and detention Mr. Ranjbar
    was arrested by detectives of the Esfahan Criminal Investigators at his
    residence several days after the murder incident. On that day, a woman
    called the police at the Nikabad Village in Esfahan informing them of the
    murder of a 60-year-old woman and her two-year-old granddaughter. Police
    noticed that the perpetrator had entered the house without any resistance.
    They investigated the relatives of the homeowner and found out that the
    husband of a granddaughter of the victim (Mr. Ranjbar) had been recently
    arrested for robbery and released on bail. When they went to his house,
    Mr. Ranjbar s wife told the police that her husband had gone to Tehran.
    However, police investigation showed that no one with that name had left
    from the city terminals. With a warrant, police entered his house and
    found and arrested Mr. Ranjbar. He was detained for three years. Trial
    Branch Nine of the General Court in Esfahan tried Mr. Ranjbar. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against
    Mr. Ranjbar were announced as murdering a woman, a two-year-old child, and
    robbery. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Ranjbar
    was recovery of bodies of the grandmother and a two-year-old child, having
    a record for robbery, finding the stolen gold on him, and his confession.
    In his confession, Mr. Ranjbar stated that he had been arrested for
    robbery 20 days before the murder incident. A relative bailed him out and
    he had to pay back the money he had stolen in 20 days. When his wife s
    grandmother went to their house, he saw her gold, was tempted, and decided
    to steal it. On the day of the incident, he went to the house of his wife
    s aunt and tried to get the golds forcefully from the grandmother. But she
    resisted and he suffocated her. Since her grandchild witnessed the
    incident, he suffocated her, too. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Ranjbar s defense. Judgment Branch Nine of the General Court in
    Esfahan condemned Mr. Mohsen Ranjbar to death for committing two murders,
    and to 74 lashes for robbery. He was hanged in public and in the presence
    of judicial and security officials of the Esfahan province at Parvin
    Street in Esfahan on December 15, 2003.
