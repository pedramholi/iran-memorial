    News of the execution of Mr. Seyed Khalil Puranvari, son of Seyed Mahmud,
    along with five others, was published on the website of ISNA (Iranian
    Students News Agency) on January 13, 2003 and in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on January 14, 2003. Arrest and detention Mr. Puranvari was
    arrested following several reports regarding gang robberies from carpet
    stores across Tehran. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial According to the Public Relations Office of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court, a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran
    tried Mr. Puranvari. No information is available on his trial. Charges The
    charges brought against Mr. Puranvari were announced as possession of 30
    grams of heroin, participation in buying 180 grams of heroin, selling 90
    grams of heroin, and addiction to heroin. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Puranvari.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Puranvari s defense. Judgment A
    branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Seyed
    Khalil Puranvari to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He
    was hanged, along with five others, in the presence of forensics
    representatives, police and court officials at Evin Prison in Tehran on
    January 9, 2003. No specific information is available about this
    execution.
