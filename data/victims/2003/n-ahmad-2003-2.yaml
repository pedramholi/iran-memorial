    In a fair judicial system, is it possible to do justice for four
    defendants in only 16 days? News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad N. (Reza
    M.), along with three others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami and
    Kayhan newspapers on December 13, 2003. His case and the cases of four
    others were related to the rape of a woman at her house in Gorgan on
    November 26, 2003. According to the Public Relations Office of the
    Golestan Security District, one of the five individuals in this group had
    escaped. Arrest and detention Mr. Ahmad N. (Reza M.) and three other
    defendants were arrested by police in Gorgan on November 27, 2003,
    following a complaint filed by a young couple. He was detained for 16 days
    (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper). The circumstances of his arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial Branch 21 of the General Court of Gorgan tried Mr.
    Ahmad N. (Reza M.) and three other defendants in the presence of a public
    defender. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Ahmad N. (Reza M.) and three other defendants was
    announced as rape. According to the existing information, on November 26,
    2003, five individuals climbed the wall of a house, home to a young
    couple. They forced their way in, threatening with a knife and an ax, tied
    hands and feet of the husband, and kept him in the kitchen. Then they
    raped the wife and escaped. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Ahmad N. (Reza M.) was a complaint by the young couple, his
    confession, and the confession of his collaborators. (Kayhan newspaper)
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense Mr. Ahmad N. (Reza M.) was drunk at the time of the
    committed crime. No information is available on his defense. However, in
    only 16 days since he was arrested, interrogated, tried, appealed, and
    ultimately executed. According to the Judicial Deputy of the Golestan
    Courthouse, defendants expressed regret and asked for forgiveness before
    being executed. (Kayhan newspaper) Judgment Branch 21 of the General Court
    of Gorgan condemned Mr. Ahmad N. (Reza M.) to death, eight years
    imprisonment, and 124 lashes. Branch Two of the Appellate Court of
    Province and Branch 32 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged, along with three others, in public at the Shahid Bahonar Square in
    Gorgan on December 11, 2003.
