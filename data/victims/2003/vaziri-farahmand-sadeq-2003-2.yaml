    Was kind to his family, friends, acquaintances and neighbours. He decided
    to leave Iran when he realized that his children were subjected to social
    discriminations because of their parents' political background. The
    information on Mr. Farahmand Sadeq Vaziri, son of Mozafar, is based on
    forms and documents sent to Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation by his wife,
    Mahin Shokrollahpour. These documents consist of an affidavit by Sonbol
    Sadeq Vaziri, Farahmand's sister, a burial licence, and a copy of verdict
    number 82/5/21 -710 and 82/8/21-711, issued by Ali Hasanzadeh, head of
    Bench 5 of the Public Court of Salmas, concerning charges related to Mr.
    Sadeq Vaziri and his family. Mr. Sadeq Vaziri was born in 1959 in Sanandaj
    (in Iranian Kurdistan province). He had a diploma of higher education and
    worked as a businessman in Tehran and Sanandaj. His relatives have
    described him as a caring and self-giving person who was kind to his
    family, friends, acquaintances and neighbours. He took pleasure in making
    everyone happy... And he always fulfilled his promises. Ever since he was
    a young man he was unhappy with social class inequalities. And for that
    reason, during the [1979] Revolution, he joined the anti-monarchy
    opposition movement. At the time of the revolution, Farahmand was a
    19-year-old military conscript. In the late summer of 1979, when the
    revolutionary government forces' attacked Sanandaj, he joined the armed
    opposition groups to defend the city and its population. But finally,
    after 25 days of resistance, he was forced to flee the city and head for
    the mountains alongside the armed opposition forces. And that was when he
    joined the Komala Peshmarga group, under the organizational name of Sa id.
    He fought in the resistance for some eight years, away from his family.
    Mr. Sadeq Vaziri was first arrested in 1987 during a mission in Sanandaj.
    According to the testimony of his sister, before arresting his brother,
    security forces put pressure on and interrogated Farahmand's family in
    order to discover his whereabouts. The security forces occupied their home
    for a week. They even beat up his father in the basement of their house.
    According to the testimony of his relatives, Farahmand was subjected to
    intense beatings and torture following his arrest. The Revolutionary Court
    of Sanandaj first sentenced him to death on charges of acting against
    national security, moharebeh [waging war against God] and armed struggle;
    but subsequently, thanks to the efforts of his family, which, among
    others, included payment of bribes to the authorities, his sentence was
    reduced to a 30-year prison term on the grounds that he was not armed at
    the time of his arrest. After a spell of three-and-a-half years in jail,
    Mr. Sadeq Vaziri was granted amnesty along with the survivors of the 1988
    prison massacres, and released from prison. After release from prison, Mr.
    Sadeq Vaziri and his wife decided to abandon political activities and lead
    a normal life devoted to their children Puya and Helya. However, they were
    not given the chance to lead a normal life because of the security and
    social pressures exerted on former political prisoners. Based on the
    testimony of Ms Shokrollahpour, who herself was a former Komala member,
    they were both barred from continuing their education upon release from
    prison. Nor were they allowed to work in government organizations.
    Although these social deprivations were not formally communicated to Mr.
    and Mrs. Sadeq Vaziri, they could not escape the realities of such
    deprivations in their day to day lives. The justification given for such
    deprivations was that they were on the list of political offenders. In
    that regard, Mrs Shokrollahpour has said: "We could not even purchase a
    house or car in our names. To do so, we needed a permit from the
    intelligence unit of the [Islamic Revolution] Guards Corps. So in order to
    buy a car at that time, we were forced to apply for a permit from the
    Intelligence [Ministry]. Nor could we obtain a passport to leave Iran."
    Mr. and Mrs. Sadeq Vaziri decided to leave Iran when they realized that
    their children were subjected to social discriminations because of their
    parents' political background. In that regard, Mrs. Sadeq Vaziri has
    written the following: "My son Puya had come first in the billiard
    competition in the province. But because of our political background, he
    was barred from taking part in the national competition. Also, my daughter
    Helya had come first in the province's swimming and mathematics
    competitions, but, again, she too was barred from entering the national
    competitions. So we decided to leave [the country] because it was
    affecting the lives of our children who had had no part in our political
    activities." Mrs. Sadeq Vaziri added that her children were barred from
    taking part in national competitions without being given any reasons. "In
    fact, the runners-up in the aforementioned competitions were entered into
    the national ones instead of our children." The Sad
