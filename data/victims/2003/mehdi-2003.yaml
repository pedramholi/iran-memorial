    News of the execution of Mr. Mehdi, without his last name, along with
    another person, was published in the Qods newspaper on January 4, 2003.
    According to the existing information, his case was related to the murder
    of a 52-year-old man at the Mujen Village near Shahrud, Semnan on January
    22, 1998. Mr. Mehdi and the other defendant of this case were the main
    defendants who were 18 years old when the crime took place. Arrest and
    detention The Intelligence Police agents in Shahrud arrested Mr. Mehdi and
    six other defendants in the winter of 1997 following the murder of the
    eulogist in the Mujen Village near Shahrud. The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch Four of the Public Court
    in Shahrud tried Mr. Mehdi and six others in several sessions. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Mehdi was announced as murder. He was accused of attacking and
    injuring the panegyrist of the Mujen Village, using stick and ax, along
    with six others, outside of the mosque after completion of his speech on
    January 22, 1998. The victim, Haj Esma il Baba i, died due to his severe
    injuries in the hospital two days later. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    According to the report, the evidence presented against Mr. Mehdi included
    deadly blows, each capable of killing. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Mehdi s defense. Judgment Branch Four of the Public Court in
    Shahrud condemned Mr. Mehdi and the other defendant to death. The Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling after five years. He was hanged, along with the
    other defendant, at the Police Station in Shahrud on January 1, 2003,
    after the Head of Judiciary validated the ruling and the victim s family
    paid the rest of Dieh [blood money]. The other five defendants of this
    case were condemned between 18 months and 3 years imprisonment depending
    on their charges.
