    News of the execution of Mr. Shahram M., along with two others, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on August 31, 2003. His case and the cases
    of two other defendants were related to drug trafficking. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Shahram M. and the other two defendants were identified and
    arrested by Narcotics Agents in Karaj, while attempting to transport
    narcotics from Zahedan to Tehran, in April of 2002. He was detained for 17
    months. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Branch Four of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Karaj tried Mr. Shahram
    M. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought
    against Mr. Shahram M. and the two other defendants was collectively
    announced as drug trafficking. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Shahram M. and the other two
    defendants was recovery of four kilograms of heroin hidden in a tea flask
    when arrested, and possession of 16 kilograms of heroin. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Shahram M. s defense. Judgment Branch Four
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Karaj condemned Mr. Shahram M. to
    death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along
    with two others, at Qezelhesar Prison in Karaj on August 21, 2003.
