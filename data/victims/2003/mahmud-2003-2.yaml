    News of the execution of Mr. Mahmud was published in the Iran newspaper on
    December 16, 2003. Arrest and detention After a man s body was recovered
    on the Chalus road on April 4, 2002, members of a family reported their
    father missing the next day. It became clear that the body was this
    father. His wife seemed indifferent to investigators when identifying the
    body. Therefore, they interrogated her and found out about the victim s
    friendship with a man named Mahmud. After police went to his work place,
    they transferred him to the Intelligence Office. The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 116 of the Karaj Court
    tried Mr. Mahmud. No information is available on his trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Mahmud was announced as murder. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    The evidence presented against Mr. Mahmud was his confession and a
    complaint filed by the victim s daughters. In his confession, Mr. Mahmud
    acknowledged knowing the victim s family and stated that he and the victim
    s wife planned the murder and she had promised him money and to marry him.
    On April 2, 2002, he took the victim to the Chalus Road, hit him on his
    head and face with blows of a rock, and hid the body. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Mahmud s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Mahmud to death and Branch 27 of the Supreme Court confirmed
    the ruling. He was hanged in Raja ishahr Prison on December 15, 2003.
