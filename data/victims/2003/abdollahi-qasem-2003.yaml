    News of the execution of Mr. Qasem Abdollahi was published in the Kayhan
    newspaper on May 27, 2003. He was an Afghan citizen. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Abdollahi was arrested 10 days after a murder that took place in 1998.
    He was detained for five years. The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch Two of the Public Court of
    Poledokhtar tried Mr. Abdollahi. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Abdollahi was announced as murder.
    He was charged with murdering another Afghan citizen. No further
    information is available on his charges. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the Head of Courthouse
    in Poledokhtar, the motive for murder was robbery of 210 thousand Tumans
    cash. The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Abdollahi. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Abdollahi s defense. Judgment Branch Two
    of the Public Court of Poledokhtar condemned Mr. Qasem Abdollahi to death
    and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public in
    Poledokhtar in May 2003. No specific information is available about this
    execution.
