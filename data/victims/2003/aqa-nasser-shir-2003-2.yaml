    News of the execution of Mr. Naser Shir Aqa was published in the Iran
    newspaper on September 9, 2003. Additional information regarding his
    prosecution was taken from the Ettela at newspaper of November 20, 2001.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Shir Aqa s arrest and
    detention are not known. According to the Ettela at newspaper, without
    mentioning the date of arrest, inspectors of the Intelligence Police in
    Tehran were able to follow clues, identify, and arrest a group of thieves
    and their collaborators. Trial Branch 15 of the Public Court of Tehran
    tried Mr. Shir Aqa. No information is available on his trial. Charges
    According to the Iran newspaper, the charges brought against Mr. Shir Aqa
    and the other 30 members of this network were collectively announced as
    stealing 12,796,758,000 Rials, $316,830, and 37.3 kilograms of gold from
    180 victims. According to the Ettela at newspaper, these thieves and purse
    snatchers entered a bank as a customers and identified individuals with
    large sums of money and bank notes. Then they informed their collaborators
    outside the bank by cell phone to follow, attack, and rob them at the
    first opportunity. They also identified people who bought gold in Tehran
    Bazar, followed and robbed them after puncturing their cars tires. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Shir Aqa and other
    members of the gang was their confession and the complaints by plaintiffs.
    During the trial, several plaintiffs described how their belongings were
    stolen. Some claimed that the robbers knew exactly where they kept their
    money such as in which pocket. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Shir Aqa s defense. Judgment The court identified Mr. Naser Shir Aqa
    as Mohareb (fighter against God) and condemned him to death. He was hanged
    in Tehran in September of 2003. The exact date of his execution is
    unknown. According to the Iran newspaper, after the death penalty against
    12 members of this gang was confirmed, their cases were referred to the
    Sentence Enforcement of the Tehran Criminal Court to be carried out in
    several months. However, they had not been carried out due to judicial
    reasons and Mr. Shir Aqa was the first to be executed.
