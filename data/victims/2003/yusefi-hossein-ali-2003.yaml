    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Ali Yusefi, along with another
    person, was published in the E temad and Iran newspapers on July 31, 2003.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Yusefi s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch 1608 of the Tehran Court tried Mr.
    Yusefi. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Yusefi was announced as murder. According to the media
    reports, he had murdered his fianc by blows of a knife in July of 2001.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Yusefi was his
    confession. The victim s parents rejected his statements during the trial
    and told the court that he had murdered their daughter to avenge her
    decision not to marry him. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense In his defense during the
    trial, Mr. Yusefi stated that he had a suspicion about his fianc and when
    she denied it, he killed her during a fight. Judgment The court condemned
    Mr. Hossein Ali Yusefi to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged at the Qasr Prison in Tehran on July 30, 2003.
