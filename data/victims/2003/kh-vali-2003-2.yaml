    News of the execution of Mr. Vali Kh., along with four others, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on October 20, 2003, quoting the
    Public Relations Office of the Kerman Courthouse. His case and the cases
    of the other defendants were related to murder, drug trafficking, and acts
    against national security. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Vali Kh. s arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Bam tried Mr. Vali Kh. No information is available
    on his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Vali Kh. and the
    other four defendants were collectively announced as murder, drug
    trafficking, and acts against national security. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Vali Kh.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Vali Kh. s defense. Judgment
    The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Bam condemned Mr. Vali Kh. to death and
    the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along with the
    other four defendants, in public in Bam in 2003. No specific information
    is available about this execution.
