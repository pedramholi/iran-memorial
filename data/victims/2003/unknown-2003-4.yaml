    News of the execution of an unknown man, along with four others, all
    members of a gang known as Jamileh, was published in the E temad newspaper
    on August 6, 2003. Additional information was taken from the Jamejam
    newspaper on April 24, 2002, and the Iran newspaper on April 22, 25, and
    27, 2002. According to the existing reports, a half-dead man was found in
    a deserted area around Varamin in 1999. The police investigation showed
    that he was a member of a gang named Jamileh whose members had been sought
    by the police for sometimes. Following an internal dispute, the other
    members of the gang tied the man with rope and harassed him. They took him
    to a desolated area to burn him. However, they were unsuccessful due to
    the traffic. Confession of this unnamed man resulted in the identification
    of all gang members including their leader. Arrest and Detention According
    to the Iran newspaper on April 25, 2002, quoting the case judge, the
    confession of a member of this gang, motivated by internal conflicts, in
    1999 resulted in the arrest of the defendant and other gang members. Trial

    other members of the gang in August of 2001. No further information is
    available on the trial. Charges The charges against the defendant and some
    other members of the gang were collectively announced as "stealing about
    one Billion Tumans worth of gold, diamond, travelers checks, and cash from

    purse-napping. They had records for sedition, extortion, purse-napping,
    and armed robbery in most cities and several countries around the Persian
    Gulf. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against the defendant and
    some other members of the gang were collectively reported as having a
    record for several criminal convictions and over 200 complaints by
    plaintiffs. Defense No information is available on the defendant's
    defense. Judgment The court identified the defendant and 11 other members
    of the gang as Mohareb (fighters against God) and condemned him to death.

    members of the gang were hanged at the Qasr Prison in Tehran on April 25,
    2002.
