    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Zaman Q. was published in the
    Khorasan newspaper on August 23, 2003, quoting the Public Relations Office
    of the Kerman Courthouse. His case was related to armed robbery, drug
    trafficking, and creating a gang. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Mohammad Zaman Q. s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kerman tried Mr. Mohammad
    Zaman Q. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Mohammad Zaman Q. were announced as sedition and drug
    trafficking. According to the report, by creating a gang, he disrupted the
    public peace, in addition to various seditious acts and drug trafficking.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Mohammad Zaman Q. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mohammad Zaman Q. s defense. Judgment Branch Two of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kerman condemned Mr. Mohammad Zaman Q. to
    death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at the
    Kerman Central Prison yard in 2003. No specific information is available
    about this execution.
