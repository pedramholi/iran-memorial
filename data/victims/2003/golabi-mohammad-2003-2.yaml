    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Golabi was published by the
    Representation of Komala Abroad on the website of Mihan on March 4, 2003
    and on the website of the Association of Iranian Political Prisoners (in
    Exile) on March 3, 2003. Mr. Golabi was from the Kanizarin Village near
    Saqez in Kurdistan. He was a member of the Komala organization. In the mid
    1960 s, several remaining members of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of
    Iran established the Revolutionary Organization of this party in Iraq.
    Among its leaders were Esma il Sharifzadeh, Abdollah Mo ini, and Mola
    avareh, who began an armed guerrilla struggle in Kurdistan inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution. The group was defeated in 1969 and several of its
    members arrested. The Revolutionary Organization of Working People in
    Kurdistan (Komala) was established upon the release of a number of the
    leaders in 1978. After the revolution, in accordance with Marxist theory,
    Komala opposed capitalists and landlords, and encouraged workers and
    peasants in Kurdistan, in particular in the city of Sanandaj and vicinity
    where they had strong support, to initiate an armed uprising against
    capitalists, landlords and the central government. In 1982, Komala joined
    another Marxist group, Sahand, an organization concentrating mainly on
    theory and ideology, and established the Communist Party of Iran. Komala
    subsequently adopted the name The Kurdistan Organization of the Communist
    Party of Iran, Komala. By the mid-1980s, the central government had
    succeeded in pushing Komala fighters out of Kurdistan and into Northern
    Iraq. Years later, Komala split from the Communist Party of Iran and faced
    several schisms, each continuing to use the name Komala. Arrest and
    detention According to the Representation of Komala Abroad, Mr. Golabi was
    arrested by security forces while injured in the leg on July 26, 1999. He
    was detained in solitary confinement for six months. According to this
    report, he was tortured physically and psychologically during his
    detention and because of non-treatment of his injury, his leg became
    paralyzed. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Golabi s trial. Charges According
    to the existing information, the charge brought against Mr. Golabi was
    announced as his activity with Komala (Association of Iranian Political
    Prisoners in Exile). No detailed information is available on his charges.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Golabi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Golabi s defense.
    Judgment A court condemned Mr. Mohammad Golabi to death. He was hanged in
    the Saqez Central Prison on March 2, 2003 in the morning. No specific
    information is available about this execution.
