    News of the execution of Mr. Javad Khodashenas was published in the Iran
    newspaper on February 24, 2003 and on the Jamejam website on February 23,
    2003. Additional information regarding his arrest was taken from the
    Ettela at newspaper of December 6, 1997. Arrest and detention According to
    the Ettela at newspaper, three armed robbers attacked a jewelry store,
    injuring four individuals and killing the storeowner, and escaped in
    November of 1997. This report indicated that Mr. Khodashenas was injured
    when arrested. However, according to the Jamejam website, a local man
    followed the robbers and informed the police. He helped them to arrest Mr.
    Khodashenas. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran tried Mr.
    Khodashenas. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Khodashenas were announced as three counts armed
    robbery from jewelry stores in Tehran, possession of a weapon and using it
    during the robberies, creating public intimidation, murdering a jewelry
    store owner, and acts against national security. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Khodashenas was his confession.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Khodashenas s
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Javad Khodashenas to death. He
    was hanged at Raja ishahr Prison in Karaj on February 16, 2003.
