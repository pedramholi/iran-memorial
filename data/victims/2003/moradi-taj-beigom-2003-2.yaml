    News of the execution of Ms. Taj Beigom Moradi, along with three men, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on July 17, 2003. Arrest and detention
    Following a missing person report, police recovered the body of a man on
    January 21, 2001. Ms. Moradi, the temporary wife of the dead man, was
    arrested. The circumstances of her arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Criminal Court of Tehran tried Ms. Moradi. No information is
    available on her trial. Charges The charge brought against Ms. Moradi was
    announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Ms. Moradi was her confession. According to the Iran newspaper
    report, ten days after her arrest, she confessed that she had given the
    victim a sleeping pill and then killed him with a pick because of their
    intense dispute. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Ms. Moradi s defense. Judgment The Criminal Court of Tehran condemned Ms.
    Taj Beigom Moradi to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. She
    was hanged at the Qasr Prison in Tehran on July 16, 2003.
