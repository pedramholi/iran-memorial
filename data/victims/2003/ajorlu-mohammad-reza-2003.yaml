    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Ajorlu was published on the
    website of Jamejam newspaper on November 30, 2003 and in the Iran
    newspaper on December 1, 2003. Mr. Ajorlu, known as Uncle Skits , was a
    puppeteer for children s shows at daycare centers in Tehran. He began
    puppeteering when he was young. He had lived with the support of a Welfare
    Organization when he was a child. His case was related to the rape and
    murder of a six-year-old girl in Tehran in March of 1991. Mr. Ajorlu had
    an arrest and detention record. He was arrested and detained for keeping
    children illegally in his house and taking advantage of them. (Iran
    newspaper) Arrest and detention While investigating the disappearance of a
    six-year-old girl named Zahra, Tehran Police agents arrested Mr. Ajorlu in
    his house at Shari ati Street in Tehran on March 7, 1992 at 11:30 a.m. He
    was detained for 12 years (Iran newspaper). The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Mr. Ajorlu was tried three times
    in various courts. In the summer of 1992, Branch 142 of the Criminal Court
    of Tehran tried him. After the Supreme Court referred the case, Branch 139
    of the Criminal Court of Tehran Province tried him for the second time in
    1994. Finally, in the spring of 2001, Branch 604 of the Public Court of
    Tehran tried him in the presence of his attorney and the victim s family
    in several sessions for the third time (Jamejam newspaper). No details are
    available on his trials. Charges According to the indictment, the charges
    brought against Mr. Ajorlu were announced as molestation [rape] and murder
    of a six-year-old girl. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the existing information, Mr. Ajorlu s confession was the
    main reason for his conviction. He confessed to murdering Zahra, covering
    her body in a white sack, and hiding it in an area on Sheikhsafi Street in
    Tehran. (Iran newspaper) Defense No information is available on Mr. Ajorlu
    s defense. The Supreme Court demanded a medical examination of Mr. Ajorlu
    about his sanity. Following this request, the Medical Commission confirmed
    his sanity. According to the existing information, he had confessed to the
    murders of four other children during the interrogation. However, the
    police investigation revealed that his story was unreal. He later claimed
    that his phony confession was due to fear of punishment. (Iran newspaper)
    Judgment Branch 142 of the Criminal Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Mohammad
    Reza Ajorlu to death for rape and to death in public for murder on
    September 19, 1992. After his objection, Branch 20 of the Supreme Court
    nullified the ruling and referred the case to a court of siimilar stand.
    Branch 139 of the Criminal Court of Tehran condemned him to death two
    counts for the second time on June 26, 1994. Following another objection
    by Mr. Ajorlu, Branch 20 of the Supreme Court nullified the ruling again.
    After referring to Branch 604 of the Public Court of Tehran, this court
    issued the same ruling for the third time on June 14, 2001. The ruling was
    confirmed by the Supreme Court. Mr. Ajorlu was hanged in Qasr Prison on
    November 30, 2003 (Iran newspaper). No further information is available
    about his execution.
