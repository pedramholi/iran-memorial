    News of the execution of Mr. Yunes Siahpushfard, known as Seyed, along
    with four others, was published in the Iran, Jomhuri Eslami, and Khorasan
    newspapers on April 17, 2003. Arrest and detention Basij forces in Rudehen
    arrested Mr. Siahpushfard at the Tartium Village near Rudehen in May of
    2001 after a murder took place (Iran newspaper). The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch Two of the Public Court
    of Damavand tried Mr. Siahpushfard. No information is available on his
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Siahpushfard was announced
    as murder. He was accused of murdering a man named Morad Ali Varmaqani by
    blows of a knife in his house at the Tartium Village near Rudehen on May
    7, 2001. (Iran and Khorasan newspapers) The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Siahpushfard. Defense No information is available on Mr. Siahpushfard s
    defense. Judgment Branch Two of the Public Court of Damavand condemned Mr.
    Yunes Siahpushfard to death. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and
    the Head of Judiciary validated it. He was hanged in the presence of the
    victim s family in Qasr Prison on April 17, 2003 (Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper). No specific information is available about this execution.
