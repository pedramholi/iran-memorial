    News of the execution of Mr. Sadeq, without his last name, was published
    in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August 25, 2003, quoting the
    Information and Public Relations Office of the Khuzestan Courthouse. His
    case was related to a carjacking and the murder of the car s owner. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Sadeq was arrested by police when driving the victim s
    car toward Ahvaz. Police first suspected the car and after searching it,
    they found a bloody knife and arrested Mr. Sadeq immediately. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch
    Three of the General Court in Ramhormoz tried Mr. Sadeq. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Sadeq were
    announced as murder and robber. According to the report, he had hired a
    taxi for Omidieh destination. On the way to Ramhormoz, he fought the
    driver, intending to carjack. After tying the driver s hands and feet, he
    murdered him with blows of a knife. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Sadeq was announced as recovery of the murder weapon, his
    confession, and other evidence. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Sadeq s defense. Judgment Branch Three of the General Court in
    Ramhormoz identified Mr. Sadeq as Mohareb [fighter against God], and
    condemned him to death. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged in public in Ramshir in 2003. No specific information is available
    about this execution.
