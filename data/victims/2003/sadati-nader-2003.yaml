    News of the execution of Mr. Nader Sadati, along with five others, was
    published by various sources including ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency)
    on January 13, 2003 and the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on January 14, 2003.
    Additional information was taken from the Kayhan newspaper on August 11,
    1996. Mr. Sadati, son of Mohammad, was from Kuhdasht, Lorestan. He resided
    in Eslamshahr, Tehran. According to existing information, he was a member
    of an eight-member gang of armed robbers. (Kayhan) Arrest and detention
    Mr. Sadati was arrested, along with seven others members of a gang, in
    August of 1996 following several reports regarding armed robbery from
    carpet stores across Tehran (ISNA and Kayhan). The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 31 of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tehran tried Mr. Sadati. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Sadati
    were announced as leading a gang of armed robbers, participation in six
    night-time armed robberies from carpet stores in Tehran threatening with a
    hand gun, shooting at the stores owners and guards, participation in two
    armed robberies from vehicles, threatening with a combat weapon at night,
    participation in four armed clashes with police in Tehran involving
    shooting at agents, carrying and possession of smuggled weapons and
    ammunition, participation in over 20 armed and unarmed robberies from
    residences in Tehran and stealing properties. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the Public Relations
    Office of the Islamic Revolutionary Court, the arrested gang members have
    confessed to several armed robberies in Tehran, armed clashes with the
    police injuring several agents, and murdering one person in Varamin.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Sadati s defense.
    Judgment Branch 31 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran condemned
    Mr. Nader Sadati to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He
    was hanged, along with five others, in the presence of forensics
    representatives, police and court officials at Evin Prison in Tehran on
    January 9, 2003. No specific information is available about this
    execution.
