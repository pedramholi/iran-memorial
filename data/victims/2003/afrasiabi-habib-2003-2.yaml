    News of the execution of Mr. Habib Afrasiabi, son of M., was published in
    the Iran and Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on April 17, 2003. Additional
    information was taken from the Iran newspaper on July 16, 2001. Mr.
    Afrasiabi s case was related to a murder that took place in 1997. Arrest
    and detention According to the Iran newspaper, Mr. Afrasiabi was arrested
    in relation to the death of a man, 54, whose naked body was found in his
    work place on March 6, 1998. He was 19 years old when arrested. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial According
    to the existing information, Mr. Afrasiabi was tried in various courts
    eight times. Branches 1603, 1601, 1602, and 1608 of the Criminal Court of
    Tehran tried him and his case went to Branch 27 of the Supreme Court
    several times. No information is available about the presence of an
    attorney during the trial sessions. Charges The charge brought against Mr.
    Afrasiabi was announced as murder. According to the existing information,
    the victim was murdered by blows of a knife to his neck. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    The evidence presented against Mr. Afrasiabi was his confession.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense Mr. Afrasiabi claimed his motive as defending his
    honor, endangered by the victim. The Head of Branch 1603 of the Criminal
    Court of Tehran, who had been at the crime scene, confirmed Mr. Afrasiabi
    s claim when issuing his ruling based on the following six reasons: 1- The
    defendant went to the location of the incident based on the victim s
    request. 2- The victim asked of the defendant an inhumane request. 3- The
    victim s body was naked and this was not fabricated. 4- The existence of
    alcohol at the scene confirms the defendant s claims. 5- The defendant had
    no premeditated motive to murder the victim. 6- The defendant did not take
    anything except a cell phone and a car key when left the scene. (Iran
    newspaper on July 16, 2001) In spite of the fact that no report referred
    to Mr. Afrasiabi s attorney, however, it seems that either he or his
    attorney requested an investigation into the contradictory and complex
    rulings issued by courts based on Article 31* of the Public and
    Revolutionary Courts. For this reason, the Judicial Inspector of the
    Judiciary Supervision Office asked the Head of the Special Criminal Court
    of Tehran to give him the case for investigation and to write a report for
    the Head of Judiciary. (Iran newspaper on July 16, 2001) The result of
    this request has not been reported. A Summary of the Defects of Mr.
    Afrasiabi s Legal Proceedings Information about the late Habib Afrasiabi s
    case is scarce and incomplete. It is not clear how he was interrogated and
    how the trial proceeded. Further, there is no information concerning the
    evidence, the various judges opinions, and court rulings. The one
    certainty is, however, that his case was adjudicated 8 separate times
    before four different criminal courts, and Supreme Court Branch 27, which
    rendered four separate and different opinions on the matter. Based on
    information published in newspapers, [Criminal Court] Branch 1603 first
    issued a death sentence in spite of emphasizing the veracity of the
    defendant s claims. Upon appeal by the late Mr. Afrasiabi, the file was
    reviewed by Branch 27, which reversed the ruling and remanded the case to
    a different [criminal court] branch. Branch 1601 rejected the charge of
    intentional murder, probably relying on a self-defense theory, and
    acquitted the Defendant. The victim s next of kin appealed from this
    decision, and the case was re-submitted to Supreme Court Branch 27.
    Contrary to its initial ruling, the Branch reversed the acquittal and
    remanded to another branch. Criminal Court Branch 1602 sentenced the
    Defendant to death. The ruling was appealed a second time by Mr.
    Afrasiabi, reversed yet again by Branch 27, and remanded to a different
    branch. This time, Criminal Court Branch 1608 issued a mandatory guilty
    verdict and sentenced the Defendant to death. Upon appeal by the
    defendant, the case was submitted one more time to Branch 27, which,
    contrary to their previous ruling, the Supreme Court Branch judges, upheld
    the death sentence. Upon issuance of such contradictory rulings, the
    Defendant or his attorney appealed the same and asked for the
    implementation of the Law on the Establishment of General and
    Revolutionary Courts, Article 31, arguing that the decision was contrary
    to the clear tenets of the Shari a and [prevailing] laws. The Prosecutor
    General or the Supreme Court rejected that argument, however, and upheld
    the death sentence. Although the pr
