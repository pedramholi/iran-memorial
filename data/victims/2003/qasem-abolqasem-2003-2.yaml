    News of the execution of Mr. Abolqasem, known as Qasem, along with another
    person, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami and Iran newspapers on April
    15, 2003, quoting the Public Relations Officer of the Qazvin Courthouse.
    Arrest and detention According to the Public Relations Officer of the
    Qazvin Courthouse, during his previous conviction, Mr. Abolqasem went on
    leave and was absent for a long period, then arrested again for possession
    of heroin. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Branch Three of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qazvin tried Mr.
    Abolqasem. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Abolqasem were announced as transportation and
    possession of 50 grams of heroin and an addiction profile in heroin. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Abolqasem was his confession and the recovery of narcotics. He
    had a record for transportation and possession of heroin and opium and
    addiction. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Abolqasem s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Abolqasem to
    death and 30 lashes. According to the Public Relations Officer of the
    Qazvin Courthouse, this ruling was confirmed by the General Public
    Prosecution Office and his pardon request rejected by the General Pardon
    Office. Mr. Abolqasem was hanged at the Qazvin Central Prison on April 13,
    2003.
