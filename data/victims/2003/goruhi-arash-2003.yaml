    News of the execution of Mr. Arash Goruhi was published in the Iran
    newspaper on August 26, 2003. His case was related to the carjacking of
    taxis and a murder. Arrest and detention Mr. Goruhi was identified and
    arrested by police on Shohaday-Sefri Street in Arak on August 12, 2001.
    According to the report, he had hired a taxi, taken it to a remote area,
    and attempted carjacking by putting a knife to the throat of the driver.
    However, the driver fought back and was killed by blows of the knife as a
    result. Witnesses reported the incident to the police and Mr. Goruhi was
    arrested while driving the victim s car half an hour later. He was
    detained for two years. Trial The Arak Courthouse tried Mr. Goruhi. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against
    Mr. Goruhi were announced as kidnapping, murder, and robbery. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Goruhi was his
    confession, police investigation, complaint by a surviving victim, and
    complaint by the victim s family. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Goruhi s defense. Judgment The Arak Courthouse condemned Mr. Arash
    Goruhi to death. He was hanged at the Arak Qasr Prison yard on August 6,
    2003 at dawn.
