    Things were not entirely easy in Iranian Kordestan in the early 2000 s.
    Young Mr. Al-e Kan an had friends who opposed the regime. His mother did
    what she could to secure his safety. The news of the execution of Mr.
    Sasan Al-e Kan'an was published by the Amnesty International Organization
    on February 21, 2003, by the web editions of Kanoon Zendanian and Peyke
    Iran on September 28, 2005 which quoted the Kurdistan Human Right
    Organization. In the Peyke Iran , Mr. Al-e Kan an s name is spelled Ali
    Kan an. In its report to the 59th session of UN Human Rights Commission
    about the status of Human Rights in Iran, the Society to Defend Human
    Rights in Iran referred to the execution of over 475 people in the past
    year. Among them were political prisoners such as Mr. Al-e Kan'an. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant s detention are not
    known. According to the report by Kurdistan Human Right Organization, Mr.
    Sasan Al-e Kan'an was arrested on 2002. Trial The ruling was issued by the
    Branch One of Sanandaj Revolutionary Court and The Supreme Court confirmed
    it. According to the Kanune Zendanian report, Mr. Al-e Kan'an was denied
    the right to appeal and his lawyer was kept uninformed about the
    confirmation process of the ruling. Charges According to an Agence France
    Presse (AFP) report quoted by Amnesty International, the charges against
    Mr. Sasan Al-e Kan'an was announced as sheltering and hiding members of
    the unauthorized Komela party in the basement of a house in Sanandaj and
    Moharebeh (enmity against God)". According to the Kanoone Zendanian web
    site, the Islamic "Revolutionary" Court in Sanandaj sentenced Mr. Al-e Kan
    an to death on various charges, including "acting against state security"
    and "supporting the Komela Organisation. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the Kanune Zendanian web site, on January 16, 2003, a well
    informed judicial official in Sanandaj announced that two armed members of
    Komela visited Sasan while they were in town. He added that they were
    about to be arrested but had escaped with the help of Sasan and two of
    others. Defense According to the Kanune Zendanian web site, Sasan denied
    all the charges during his interrogation and hearing. Judgment On January
    5, 2003, the Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Sanandaj
    sentenced Sasan Al-e Kan an to death. The sentence was upheld by the
    Supreme Court on February 10, 2003. Mr. Al-e Kan an was hanged in the
    Sanandaj prison at 4 am on February 19. The officials did not inform his
    family. According to the Amnesty International report: Several days
    earlier Sasan Ale Kan an s mother had visited the capital, Tehran, to seek
    a meeting with a visiting delegation of the UN s Working Group on
    Arbitrary Detention (WGAD), at which she reportedly intended to raise the
    case of her son s arrest and sentencing. She arrived at Sanandaj prison to
    visit her son after 10pm on February 19th and was told to go to the
    judiciary s local offices. There she learned that her son had been
    executed earlier that morning. She was told not to make a "fuss" and to
    bury him quickly. Sasan Al-e Kan an was reportedly buried at 2am on
    February 20th in the Behesht-e Mohammadi cemetery in Sanandaj. Amnesty
    International reminded the Iranian authorities that the death penalty is
    in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
    International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which
    Iran is a state party. Also, the Organization emphasized that Sasan Al-e
    Kena n did not face charges that involved "intentional crimes with lethal
    or other extremely grave consequences", limits to the death penalty set
    out in the UN s "Safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those
    facing the death penalty", which are intended to limit the use of the
    death penalty. Finally, AI urges the authorities to urgently review
    sentencing procedures in connection with charges of moharebeh ba khoda
    ('enmity with God'), with a view to bringing them in line with
    international standards as set out in the of the International Covenant on
    Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Iran is a state party.
