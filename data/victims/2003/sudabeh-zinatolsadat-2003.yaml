    News of the execution of Ms. Zinatolsadat (Sudabeh), without a last name,
    was published in the Jamejam newspaper on October 8, 2003, and in the
    Khorasan newspaper on October 9, 2003. Additional information was taken
    from the Hamshahri newspaper on May 8, 2000. Her case was related to the
    murder of an old man and his grandchild at Yas Apartment Building in
    Puneh, Tehran, in 1999. Arrest and detention Ms. Zinatolsadat (Sudabeh)
    was identified and arrested by criminal investigators of Branch Ten at a
    party while drunk in July of 1999. According to the existing information,
    on August 10, 1999, residents of Yas Apartment Building contacted the
    police regarding a strong stench from a residential unit. When agents of
    Police Station 140 showed up, they broke into the apartment and found a
    body of a 70-year-old man in the living room. After searching the
    apartment, they found the body of an 11-year-old boy with tied hands and
    gagged mouth in a closet. The preliminary investigation revealed that the
    son and father of the victims was missing; however, he was arrested
    several days later. During the interrogation, he claimed that a woman
    named Zinatolsadat, who was his temporary wife, was the perpetrator of
    these murders. According to him, her motive was to revenge on him because
    he had rejected her proposal for marriage (Hamshahri newspaper). Based on
    these statements, police arrested Ms. Zinatolsadat. She was detained for
    four years. Trial Branch 1602 of the Criminal Court of Tehran tried Ms.
    Zinatolsadat (Sudabeh) in several sessions. However, no information is
    available on her trial. Charges The charges brought against Ms.
    Zinatolsadat (Sudabeh) were announced as murdering two individuals and
    drinking alcoholic beverages. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Ms. Zinatolsadat (Sudabeh) were recovery of two bodies, confession
    of her temporary husband, and her own confession. According to the
    existing information, her temporary husband stated that she traveled
    frequently to his father s home. She also confessed that she had added
    sleeping pills into the victims food, made them unconscious, and murdered
    them. (Khorasan newspaper) International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Ms. Zinatolsadat (Sudabeh)
    defended herself during the trial; however, no information is available on
    her defense. It is not clear if she had been drunk while being
    interrogated and confessed. Judgment Branch 1602 of the Criminal Court of
    Tehran condemned Ms. Zinatolsadat (Sudabeh) to death for committing two
    murders, and to 80 lashes and one-year imprisonment for drinking alcoholic
    beverages. Branch Two of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. She was
    hanged at the Qasr or Evin Prison yard in Tehran on October 8, 2003.
