    News of the execution of Mr. Reza Hamrahi, son of Rahim, along with two
    others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on January 2, 2003
    and in the Kayhan newspaper on January 1, 2003. Additional information was
    taken from the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on June 9, 1999. According to the
    existing information, Mr. Hamrahi s case was related to an armed attack at
    the Basij Base in the Noghduz Village near Ahar that resulted in killing
    of a Revolutionary Guard on April 30, 1999, and the murder of three
    individuals. Arrest and detention Agents of the Intelligence Office of
    Revolutionary Guards in Tabriz and security forces arrested Mr. Hamrahi
    and the other two defendants in June of 1999 during an investigation into
    the attack at the Basij Base in the Noghduz Village near Ahar. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch
    Three of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz tried Mr. Hamrahi and
    the other two defendants of this case. No information is available on his
    trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Hamrahi were announced as
    Moharebeh [fighting against God] and Efsad [corruption on Earth] by armed
    robbery, creating fear and intimidation, public disturbance, and murdering
    4 individuals. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper report, in addition to other evidence, the
    confession of Mr. Hamrahi was the basic reason for the ruling. According
    to the defendants confessions, bodies of two individuals, buried near Ahar
    after being murdered, were recovered. According to the report, these two
    individuals had been collaborators of the defendants, who had been
    murdered by three defendants, due to internal conflicts. They also killed
    a driver of a car by a firearm and stole his car in Haris, Ajerbaijan-e
    Sharqi, on April 30, 1999. Then they changed the plate and attacked the
    Basij Base in the Noghduz Village killing an agent. Additionally, stolen
    six firearms and cool cartridges from the Basij Base and the defendants
    personal weapons were among the evidence against them. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Hamrahi s defense. Judgment Branch
    Three of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz condemned Mr. Reza
    Hamrahi and the other two defendants of this case to death for Moharebeh
    [fighting against God] and Efsad [corruption on Earth]. Branch 32 of the
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along with two others,
    in public in front of the government building in Ahar on January 1, 2003.
