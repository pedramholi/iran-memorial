    News of the execution of Mr. Habib Qandi was published on the Isfahaninfo
    website on June 3, 2003. Additional information regarding his arrest and
    prosecution was taken from the Iran newspaper on March 17, and in the
    Kayhan newspaper on March 19, 2003. According to the Iran newspaper
    report, after a 12-year-old boy was missing from his school entrance, his
    family received an anonymous call stating that the boy has been kidnapped
    and demanding 50 million Tumans to release him. The Intelligence Police in
    Esfahan got involved to tracking down the kidnappers. The next day the
    near-dead body of the boy was recovered on a highway near Esfahan. He died
    in the hospital. By asking the students of his school, police gathered
    information regarding the kidnappers car. They also concluded that the
    victim must have known the main kidnapper because he got into the car
    willingly. Arrest and Detention On March 15, 2003, the Intelligence Police
    in Esfahan summoned and arrested Mr. Qandi, a close relative of the
    victim, after interrogating him. (Iran newspaper) Trial Branch 53 of the
    Criminal Court in Esfahan tried Mr. Qandi. According to the Kayhan report,
    the court session took four hours during which the judge read the charges
    against the first and second row defendants and they defended themselves.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Qandi were announced as "kidnapping,
    extortion of 50 million Tumans, and murdering the kidnapped student." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Qandi was his
    confession. He stated that since the boy s father was rich and had an
    appliance shop, he and his friend planned the kidnapping and picked up the
    boy from his school and took him to his workshop. (Iran newspaper)
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense In his defense, Mr. Qandi stated that his motivation
    to murder was his financial difficulties and he had no animosity toward
    the boy s father. When he realized that police were looking for the
    kidnappers and that the boy had recognized him, he committed this stupid
    act and murdered the boy in a mental panic. (Kayhan newspaper) Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Habib Qandi to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in the Esfahan Central Prison on May
    28, 2003.
