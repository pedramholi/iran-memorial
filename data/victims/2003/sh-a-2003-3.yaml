    News of the execution of Mr. A. Sh., along with another defendant of the
    same case, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami and Ettela at newspapers on
    February 26, 2003. According to the existing information, his case was
    related to an armed robbery from a jewelry store in Ahvaz in September of
    2002. According to the Ettela at newspaper, this case was one of the
    speediest cases in Ahvaz judiciary history. Arrest and detention Mr. A.
    Sh. was arrested between September of 2002 and February of 2003. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. A. Sh. s trial. Charges The charge brought
    against Mr. A. Sh. was announced as armed robbery. He was accused of
    attacking a jewelry store at Salman-e Farsi Street in Ahvaz, along with
    two other defendants, and stealing 3 kilograms of gold in September of
    2002. (Ettela at newspaper) The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the Information Head of Khuzestan Courthouse, firing 45 shots
    resulting in injuries to the store owner and a police agent were in
    evidence presented against Mr. A. Sh. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. A. Sh. s defense. Judgment A court condemned Mr. A. Sh. and the
    other defendant to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He
    was hanged, along with the other defendant, in public at Salman-e Farsi
    Intersection in Ahvaz on February 25, 2003 in the morning. The third
    defendant of this case was condemned to 10 years imprisonment. (Jomhuri
