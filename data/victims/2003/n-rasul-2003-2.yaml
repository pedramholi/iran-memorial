    The execution of Mr. Rasul N. was reported by the Khorassan daily on
    October 23, 2003. The report suggests that another person convicted of Ali
    Asghar’s murder on a different date (January 13, 2003) was also hanged at
    the same time and place. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of
    the basic guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. N.’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Based on the
    report, Mr. N. was accused of stabbing a person named Ali Asghar to death
    on December 6, 2002. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. N.'s defense.
    Judgment Mr. N. was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. He was
    hanged at dawn in the courtyard of Qasr Prison.
