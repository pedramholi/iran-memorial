    News of the execution of Mr. A. M., age 31, along with four others, was
    published in the Iran, Jomhuri Eslami, and Khorasan newspapers on April
    17, 2003. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. A. M. s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch 1606 of the Public Court of Tehran
    tried Mr. A. M. No information is available on his trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. A. M. was announced as rape. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. A.
    M. Defense No information is available on Mr. A. M. s defense. Judgment
    Branch 1606 of the Public Court of Tehran condemned Mr. A. M. to death.
    The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and the Head of Judiciary validated
    it. He was hanged in Qasr Prison on April 17, 2003. No specific
    information is available about this execution.
