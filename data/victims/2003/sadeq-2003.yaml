    News of the execution of Mr. Sadeq, known as Akbar, along with another
    person, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami and Iran newspapers on April
    15, 2003, quoting the Public Relations Officer of the Qazvin Courthouse.
    Arrest and detention According to the Public Relations Officer of the
    Qazvin Courthouse, during his previous conviction, Mr. Sadeq went on leave
    and was absent for a long period, then arrested again for possession of
    heroin. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Branch Three of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qazvin tried Mr. Sadeq.
    No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought
    against Mr. Sadeq were announced as transportation and possession of 53
    grams of heroin and an addiction to heroin. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Sadeq was his
    confession and the recovery of narcotics. He had a record for
    transportation and possession of heroin and opium and addiction.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Sadeq s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Sadeq to death and 20 lashes. According
    to the Public Relations Officer of the Qazvin Courthouse, this ruling was
    confirmed by the General Public Prosecution Office and his pardon request
    rejected by the General Pardon Office. Mr. Sadeq was hanged at the Qazvin
    Central Prison on April 13, 2003.
