    Because the village of Gelin was a disenfranchised and underprivileged
    area, and because there was conflict between Kurdish opposition parties
    and government forces, Mr. Tanhaian was deprived of an education as a
    child and had only completed elementary school Information about Mr.
    Habibollah Tanhaian s murder while in custody, was obtained from Rooz News
    and Analysis Website (October 1, 2013) and from Mr. Yasser Goli s
    testimony [published] by the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center (May
    11, 2012). Additional information was obtained from the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation s interview with Mr. Ammar Goli, a person who was
    close to Mr. Tanhaian and saw his body after he had been murdered. Mr.
    Tanhaian was a 45-year-old Kurd from the Ourami-speaking village of Gelin,
    located in [the city of] Sanandaj s Javrud region. He was married, had
    four children, and resided in Sanandaj s underprivileged neighborhood of
    Ghafur. Because the village of Gelin was a disenfranchised and
    underprivileged area, and because of the clashes between Kurdish
    opposition parties and government forces, Mr. Tanhaian was deprived of an
    education as a child and had only an elementary school education. He was a
    tile and stone installer and at times engaged in beekeeping (Boroumand
    Foundation interview). According to Mr. Ammar Goli, Mr. Tanhaian did not
    hold any religious beliefs. He had been accused of atheism and heresy by
    Darvish groups, extremist religious individuals and groups, and local
    forces dependent on and associated with the regime, because of the
    conversations he had with his friends and the people around him,
    criticizing religious and political issues in Kurdistan (Boroumand
    Foundation interview). According to Mr. Goli, Mr. Tanhaian was a quiet and
    generous man. He was known among his entourage and the residents of the
    village of his birth as a person who helped others. Mr. Tanhaian had a
    fighting spirit and was faithful to his ideals and political beliefs,
    which he defended with logic, not other means (Boroumand Foundation
    interview). Based on available information, Mr. Tanhaian had been arrested
    several times for his political party-related activities but had been
    released without being convicted. He was a supporter of the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan, and participated in party activities by
    distributing party pamphlets, announcements, books, and CD s in Sanandaj.
    Mr. Tanhaian s brother was a member of the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan who was killed in the clashes between the Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan forces and the Army of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
    forces between 1985 and 1987 (Boroumand Foundation interview). The
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan was founded in 1945 with the goal of
    obtaining autonomy for Kurdistan in northwestern Iran. After the Islamic
    Revolution, the disagreements between the Shi a government of the Islamic
    Republic and the mainly Sunni-inhabited Kurdistan Province regarding the
    rights and roles of minorities in drafting the Constitution, designating
    the Shi a religion as the country s official religion, and the issue of
    Kurdistan s autonomy in particular, led to severe clashes, at times armed,
    between the Revolutionary Guards and the Peshmerga (the armed forces of
    the Democratic Party of Kurdistan). The Democratic Party of Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan boycotted the April 1 referendum [on the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic (April 1, 1979)]. On August 19,
    1979, Ayatollah Khomeini declared the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan unofficial and illegal and called it the party of the Devil .
    Mass executions and heavy armed battles continued in the region for
    months. Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan lost its power in the region
    to a great extent in the course of the following four years, and several
    of [its] leaders were assassinated. In 2006, there was a split in the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan following internal disputes, which
    divided the Party into two separate organizations, Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan and Kurdistan Democratic Party . Arrest and detention On
    December 12 or December 13, 2003, following a report by a person close to
    him to the effect that Mr. Tanhaian had a secret warehouse where he kept
    the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan s pamphlets and announcements,
    Sanandaj Information Administration forces arrested Mr. Tanhaian in
    Sanandaj s Ghafur neighborhood. The agents took him to one of Sanandaj
    Information Administration s detention centers. Mr. Tanhaian was at that
    detention center for 9 days (Boroumand Foundation interview). Ammar Goli:
    A man with a motorcycle, that nobody knew, would go to his house twice a
    day and threaten his wife and family, insult them, and tell them We ve
    killed your husband and we will give you his corpse soon . According to
    Mr. Ammar Goli, after Mr. Tanhaian s arrest, Information forces took him
    and the person who had reported him to Mr. Tanhaian s home where they
    discovered
