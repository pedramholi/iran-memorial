    News of the execution of Mr. Fath ali was published in the Iran newspaper
    on June 19, 2003. Additional information regarding his prosecution was
    taken from the Iran newspaper of September 12, 2002, and the Ettela at
    newspaper of November 4, 1999. Mr. Fath aliworked at a slaughterhouse.
    Arrest and detention According to the Ettela at newspaper, bodies of a
    woman and her two children, who had been murdered by blows of knife, were
    recovered at their house on February 3, 1998. This woman s husband told
    the police that his brother-in-law had an enmity with them. Following the
    issuance of a judicial order, Mr. Fath ali was arrested with a murder
    charge. Trial Branch 1607 of the Criminal Court of Tehran tried Mr. Fath
    ali on November 3, 1999. (Ettela at newspaper) No information is available
    on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Fath ali was
    announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the media
    reports, the evidence presented against Mr. Fath ali was the existence of
    blood marks on his shirt that matched a victim s blood type, his absence
    from work for hours when the murder took place, a missing slaughter knife
    that was always in his house, and testimonies of neighbors who had seen a
    man hastily escaping the murder scene with a car. Defense During his
    interrogation and trial, Mr. Fath ali claimed innocence and never
    confessed to the crime. No other information is available on his defense.
    Judgment The judge considered the case an example of Lowth* cases.
    Therefore, it was decided that the victim s family decides the fate of Mr.
    Fath ali by going through the Qassameh** ceremony. The family of the
    children s mother pardoned him but the children s father madeoath 50 times
    and demanded the court to condemn his brother-in-law to death. The court
    condemned Mr. Fath ali to death (two counts) based onQassameh performed by
    complainant and after Mr. Fath ali objected to the ruling, the case was
    referred to Branch 31 of the Supreme Court that confirmed the ruling. Mr.
    Fath ali was hanged at the Qasr Prison yard in Tehran on June 18, 2003.
    ............................................. *In the Shari law, Lowth is
    when the judge is suspected that the defendant committed the murder or
    injury but there is no evidence. Then, the plaintiff (victim s family) can
    prove it by going through a Qassameh ceremony which is an oath by the
    victim s family. ** Qassameh means an oath taken by a group of people. It
    is one of the ways that a defendant s guilt or innocence can be proven for
    both intentional and non-intentional offenses. Per Iran s Islamic Penal
    Code, qassameh is carried out in instances where a crime has occurred and
    no convincing evidence or witnesses exist which could prove the defendant
    s guilt, and where a judge has doubt about the defendant s guilt based
    solely on circumstantial evidence a circumstance referred to in religious
    jurisprudence as lowth. Where lowth obtains, the judge is bound to ask the
    defendant to produce evidence disproving the charge. If the defendant
    demonstrates his innocence in this way, he is acquitted. Failing this, the
    plaintiff may perform qassameh in order to prove the defendant s guilt, or
    request that the defendant perform qassameh to disprove the charges. This
    procedure, which requires a defendant to prove his innocence, is contrary
    to the principle of presumption of innocence and violates the defendant s
    right to remain silent. The principle of the presumption of innocence -
    recognized in Iran s constitution, Code of Criminal Procedure, and
    international agreements to which Iran is signatory holds that all persons
    are to be considered innocent until proven guilty. A defendant should not
    be made to prove his own innocence. Proving the charges made against the
    defendant by presenting adequate evidence and witnesses is the duty of the
    prosecuting authority (in the Iranian context, the public prosecutor or a
    private plaintiff.) The right to remain silent is among the defendant s
    rights of defense, affording him the right to refrain from answering
    questions regarding the charges entered against him. Such silence may not
    be treated as an indication or evidence of guilt or innocence. In order to
    substantiate a charge of homicide through qassameh, an oath is required
    from 50 male relatives of the plaintiff. For the charge to be dismissed,
    fifty male relatives of the defendant must swear to his innocence. Should
    the number of male relatives taking the oath be less than 50, the
    defendant may repeat the oath himself in order to meet the required number
    of swears. In homicide cases, it is not possible for a plaintiff to repeat
    the oath in this way. It is not necessary for those taking the oath to
    have witnessed the commission of the crime themselves. In Hanafi
    jurisprudence, qassameh can only be carried out to disprove charges
    against a defe
