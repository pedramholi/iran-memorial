    He was a single man, born and raised in Andimeshk, where he was an active
    member of the Independent Union of the Unemployed Workers of Andimeshk.
    Information regarding the execution of Hossein Shakeri and 15 others, as
    well as the extrajudicial execution of six others, was gathered from two
    interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC). One
    interview was with a participant in the Andimeshk protest of March 1980
    (April 15, 2024), and the other was with a political activist of the time
    (April 13, 2024), as well as a statement by Khomeini's representative
    published in the Bamdad newspaper (March 30, 1980), quoted by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of Dezful, and announcements by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Dezful, reported in Jomhouri-e Eslami
    newspaper (July 27, 1980) and Kayhan newspaper (March 17 and July 26,
    1980). Additional information was also taken from the IRGC's publicity in
    the Jomhouri-e Eslami, Ettela'at, and Enqelab-e Eslami newspapers (March
    17, 1980); Peykar Magazine, the publication of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class (April 1 and 15, May 5, and September
    29, 1980); Andisheh and Peykar (August 20-23); Kar, the publication of the
    Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas - Minority; and several
    websites, including Jahan-e Novin (March 1980), Akhbar-e Rooz (by Mokhtar
    Shalalvand, June 4, 2012), Nedaye Azadi (by Fariba Marzban, September 27,
    2013), and Pezhvak-e Iran (by Iraj Mesdaghi and Musa Hatamian, August 9,
    2017). Mr. Hossein Shakeri, a single man, was born and lived in Andimeshk.
    He was an active member of the Independent Association of Unemployed
    Workers of Andimeshk and one of its key organizers, playing a central role
    in the Association's activities and related protests. Mr. Shakeri was also
    a supporter of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization - Minority. After the
    organization split, he and a group of like-minded individuals formed an
    independent movement under the name of Pishgam. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly
    in the political arena and the labor movement. 1980 Andimeshk Protest Less
    than a year after the 1979 revolution, an atmosphere of hope emerged among
    young people seeking justice and social rights. During this period, there
    were numerous protests in cities such as Tehran, Tabriz, Mahabad, Sari,
    Amol, Shiraz, Isfahan, Ilam, Gonbad Kavus, Rasht and Abadan, where
    demonstrators demanded jobs and economic rights. Unemployed youth in
    various regions sought to organize their employment-related issues by
    forming independent associations or unions, free from political
    affiliations. In Tabriz, for example, the " Graduate and Post-Graduate
    Union" was formed, which successfully held meetings with provincial
    authorities and received official recognition from the provincial
    government, allowing it to pursue its goals. Similar organizations in
    other cities, however, faced harsh repression. In one notable incident,
    one person was killed and four others were injured during a crackdown on
    protests by unemployed workers in Isfahan. Unemployed workers'
    associations in Dorud and Andimeshk were also violently repressed. At the
    time, Andimeshk's population had increased due to an influx of migrants
    and wartime displacement, exacerbating social problems in the area. The
    Independent Union of the Unemployed in Andimeshk* was founded after the
    1979 revolution with a focus on workers' rights. It aimed to defend the
    right to work and to protest "appointed hiring practices in state
    institutions and the interference of Islamic associations in employment
    decisions. Early on, union representatives negotiated with the mayor, who
    gave them a room in the city hall. This space became their official
    headquarters and helped them organize their efforts more effectively.
    Union members gathered there daily to hold meetings and send letters to
    Andimeshk authorities demanding jobs for the city's unemployed. Despite no
    official response, the union's activities, such as distributing flyers and
    organizing protests, gained strong support from young people. Between
    3,000 and 4,000 unemployed youth joined the union, paying a small
    membership fee. Despite the mayor's initial cooperation with the union,
    this resulted in a series of disagreements between the mayor's office and
    the governor's office. These disagreements ultimately led to the mayor's
    dismissal. According to union members, the government ignored their
    demands, which included giving priority to hiring local workers. In
    response, the union organized a sit-in at the Ministry of Educat
