circumstances: >
    In 1980, Mr. Rezayi was one among several defendants judged at the same
    time at the Shiraz Tribunal. The execution of Mr. Ahmad Rezayi and 15
    others was reported by the correspondents of the Jomhuri Eslami and Kayhan
    dailies in Shiraz (July 5, 1980). International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual crimes, and other
    criminal offenses. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this individual s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Based on the
    Jomhuri Eslami report, the religious judge traveled to Shiraz and, after
    visiting the Revolutionary Guard (Pasdaran) headquarters of Shiraz, headed
    for the Shiraz Tribunal, where he examined the cases of sixteen
    individuals charged with a range of crimes from killing and suppression of
    revolutionary combatants to drug dealing and sodomy. Mr. Rezayi was one of
    the defendants. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Charges Based on the Jomhuri Eslami report, Mr. Rezayi was
    charged with being a drug dealer and participating in 54 armed robberies.
    The Kayhan daily report mentioned his charge as selling and buying drugs.
    Evidence of guilt The reports contain no information regarding the
    evidence presented against the defendant at the trial. Defense No
    information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment The
    defendant, who, according to the Kayhan report, was sentenced to life
    imprisonment in the previous regime, received a death sentence at the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz. The Jomhuri Eslami report
    specifies that the sentence included confiscation of property for six of
    the accused. It is not clear whether or not Mr. Rezayi s properties were
    confiscated.
