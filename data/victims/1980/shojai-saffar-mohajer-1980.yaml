circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Safar Mohajer Shoja'i was reported along with five
    others in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (August 23, 1980). Arrest and detention
    There is no information available on the circumstances of Mr. Mohajer
    Shoja'i s arrest and detention in this report. Trial The report provided
    no information on Mr. Mohajer Shoja'i s trial. Charges The report included
    a list of charges concerning all six defendants in general but did not
    specify the charges applicable to each individual. These general charges
    were as follows: buying and selling drugs , distributing heroin ,
    promoting prostitution , and taking advantage of innocent girls and women
    . The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information on the accused s defense is available.
    Judgment The Special Court for Campaign against Drugs and Narcotics
    declared Mr. Mohajer Shoja'i a corruptor on earth and an "enemy of God .
    He was executed in the afternoon.
