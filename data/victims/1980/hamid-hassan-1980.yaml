    Revolutionary Tribunal regarding this case (July 16, 1980). The communiqu

    leftist, rightist and Monafeq [hypocrites, referring to the People s
    Mojahedin of Iran] grouplets were involved, and the above-mentioned
    defendant was an ally of these treacherous grouplets. The clash resulted
    in the martyrdom of a number of pure Muslim youths who had responded to

    of the rotten imperialist culture and replace it with rich Islamic
    culture. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest

    university unrest, as well as the witnesses testimonies as follows: He has
    been actively resisting the zealous, freedom-loving, and Muslim people of
    Gilan, resulting in assault and battery and even martyrdom of a few,
    despite the laws of the Islamic Revolutionary Council, orders of the
    Republic, and confirmation of the leader of the Revolution, Imam Khomeini.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Hamid s defense. Judgment Based
    on the communiqu , the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Gilan found Mr.
    Hamid guilty of waging war against God and his prophet. He was executed at
