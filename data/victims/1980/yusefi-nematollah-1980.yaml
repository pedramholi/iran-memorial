    Mr. Ne matollah Yusefi s name appeared in a list of 21 executed
    individuals, reported by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals of Tehran and
    Hamedan and published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (June 7, 1980). Arrest
    and detention The report provided no information regarding the
    circumstances of Mr. Yusefi s arrest and detention. Trial The Jomhuri
    Eslami report mentioned that Mr. Yusefi was tried at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Hamedan, presided by the religious judge. No
    specific information was provided regarding his trial. Charges Based on
    the report, Mr. Yusefi was charged with keeping 595 grams of heroin as
    well as having several drug-related records and participation in the
    recent torching of the Hamadan prison. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Evidence of guilt The report did not contain
    any information regarding the evidence presented against the accused.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Yusefi s defense. Judgment Mr.
    Yusefi was sentenced to death and confiscation of all his belongings. The
    death sentence was carried out within moments after the issuance of the
    verdict.
