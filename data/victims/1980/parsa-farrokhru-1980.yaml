    From biology teacher to doctor to Minister of Education, she made a big
    impact on schooling in Iran. In the end, her independent mind and passion
    for improving girls education were seen as a threat. The Prosecutor
    General of the Islamic Revolution announced the execution of Mrs. Esfand
    Farrokhru Parsa, former Minister of Education, along with two other
    individuals, in a communiqu published on May 8, 1980. The daily Enqelab-e
    Eslami reported the news the same day, quoting the Prosecutor's communiqu
    . Ettelaat (April 23 and 27, 1981) and Enqelab-e Eslami (April 29, 1980)
    reported on the first, second, and fifth sessions of her trial. Ms. Parsa
    was a well-known public figure in pre-revolutionary Iran. She started her
    career as a biology teacher in a Tehran high school. She studied medicine
    and became a medical doctor. Her political career included membership in
    the Iran Novin Party, deputy in the Iranian Parliament, and a long tenure
    in the Ministry of Education. Arrest and detention No information
    regarding the circumstances of the defendant's arrest, which took place on
    February 17, 1980, and her subsequent detention is available. Trial Based
    on press reports, The Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran tried Mrs. Parsa
    and Mr. Homayun Jaber Ansari. The first and second sessions of her trial
    took place on April 22 and 23, 1980. The press reports indicate there were
    three sessions of her trial. Charges The indictment against Mrs. Parsa was
    read by the presiding judge during the first session of the trial on April
    22. The charges against her, as reported in Ettelaat , were: "plunder of
    public treasury; causing corruption and spreading prostitution in the
    Ministry of Education; collaborating effectively with the disbanded SAVAK
    in order to repress and dismiss freedom loving combatant employees from
    the Ministry of Culture to strengthen the hated Pahlavi regime; giving
    effective speeches to strengthen the above mentioned regime; participating
    in passing anti-people laws; using her function and position to break the
    laws and make the education system reliant on imperialist culture; being
    close to Nasiri, who was executed; having unlawful relationship with the
    her office Director." The indictment concludes following the description
    of the evidence (see below), "based on the fact that [the accused] belongs
    to the Baha'i sect, the Azali Branch, and has pretended to be a Muslim.
    Based on other evidence in her file, it is clear that the accused has
    committed sins. It is thus requested that her case be examined and she be
    sentenced to the maximum penalty and her property be confiscated."
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have executed
    individuals on trumped-up charges such as drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The indictment described
    the basis for the above mentioned charges. The evidence included
    individual complaints and reports regarding the defendant s record as a
    Minister. The indictment listed the complaints as follows: "the complaint
    filed by Sharifzadeh accused her of using her position to close the
    plaintiff's school;" "the complaint filed by Abdolali Najafi stated there
    was abuse and corruption in the Ministry of Education and bribes were paid
    to journalists sympathetic to the hated Pahlavi regime for propaganda
    purposes;" "the complaint filed by Heidar Erfani accused her of being the
    cause of the plaintiff's exile;" "a report regarding the fact that the
    accused has misused several million tomans and has made the Ministry of
    Education dependant on American imperialist culture;" "a complaint by Mr.
    Mohammad Azizi accused her of forcing him to retire and causing him
    financial and psychological damage;" "a complaint filed by Mojtaba Modares
    Tirani accused her of closing his school which dishonored him and caused

    fired her husband, the doorman in Reza Pahlavi's school, because he failed
    to show respect to Prime Minister Hoveida, seriously affecting their lives
    and causing extraordinary damages;" "the complaint filed by Ms. Akhtar Ali
    Ashab stating the accused was an incompetent Minister and was taken
    advantage of by her assistants causing dissatisfaction and division among
    the staff;" The indictment also referred to "a report by the disbanded
    SAVAK [political police] stating the accused imported 400 thousand rials
    worth of goods for her personal use without paying custom fees (abuse of
    power);" "an incitation letter to her, as Minister, from Nasiri [former
    head of the political police], who was executed;" "the fact that the
    accused was declared incompetent as a minister and responsible for the
    ruin of the education system by the employees of the Iran Novin Party;" a

    Party memb
