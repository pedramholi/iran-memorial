    Mr. Babollah Sheikhi s name appeared in a list of 21 executed individuals,
    reported by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals of Tehran and Hamedan and
    published the Jomhuri Eslami daily (June 7, 1980). Arrest and detention
    The report provided no information regarding the circumstances of Mr.
    Shiekhi s arrest and detention. Trial The Jomhuri Eslami report mentioned
    that Mr. Sheikhi was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Hamedan, presided by the religious judge. No specific information was
    provided regarding his trial. Charges Based on the report, Mr. Sheikhi was
    accused of having accompanied another defendant (Bahman Rashidi) to the
    village of Jarqan to buy drugs after his release from prison. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report mentioned that Mr. Rashidi was arrested with some drugs on him, but
    the nature and amount of the drugs were not specified. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Rashidi s defense. Judgment Mr. Rashidi
    was sentenced to death and confiscation of all his belongings. The death
    sentence was carried out within moments after the issuance of the verdict.
