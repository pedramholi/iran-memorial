circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Kiani, a cab driver, and two others was
    announced by the assistant of the public prosecutor of Hamedan. This
    announcement was published in the Jomhuri Eslami, Enqelab Eslami, and
    Kayhan dailies (July 5, 1980). The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this individual’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on Mr. Kiani’s trial. Charges Mr. Kiani was charged with
    “producing, distributing, and using heroin.” Evidence of guilt According
    to the reports, the Narcotics Agents discovered 190 kilograms of acid,
    particular heroin-producing devices, and 1080 grams of a suspicious white
    powder in the defendant’s possession. Defense No information is available
    on the defendant’s defense. Judgment The assistant of the public
    prosecutor announced that Mr. Kiani declared a “corruptor on earth” and
    that he was executed at dawn on a Wednesday.
