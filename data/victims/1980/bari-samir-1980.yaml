    The execution of Mr. Samir Bari was announced in a communiqu of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecution Office of Abadan and Khoramshahr,
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (July 29, 1980). Arrest and
    detention No information is available on the circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention. Trial Based on the communiqu , the
    defendant was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Abadan and
    Khoramshahr in July 29, 1980. Charges According to the communiqu , Mr.
    Bari was accused of being an Iraqi spy. Specifically, he was charged with
    passing on reports to the Ba th party about the Abadan refinery, the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal, the Enqelab (Revolution) prison, and the
    Kuwaities bazaar. Allegedly, he was one of the top students of the Ba th
    Party s student union. Having completed the arms training sessions with
    highest degrees and after working under the direct supervision of Faruq
    Al- ami, the head of the union, he had volunteered to go to Abadan on an
    espionage mission. Evidence of guilt The communiqu mentioned that the
    verdict was issued based on the defendant s confessions as well as
    discovered reels and tapes. Defense No information is available on the
    defendant s defense. Judgment After quoting some Koranic verses, the
    communiqu reads as follows: Once again the Ba th party was struck by God s
    cunning. Sometimes in Kurdistan, sometimes in Khuzestan, they committed
    the most wicked criminal acts with the illusion that they could lead this
    wounded nation s Islamic Republic astray. What an illusion! Once again a
    mercenary spy was caught in the grip of the Islamic Justice to see the
    results of his shameful acts. Mr. Bari was found guilty of corruption on
    earth and waging war against God. He was executed at 5:42 p.m. on the day
    of his trial.
