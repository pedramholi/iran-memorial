    The information about Mohammad Behruzfar has been drawn from an electronic
    form, which a friend has sent to Omid. The execution of Mr. Behruzfar and
    14 other individuals was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (July 31,
    1980). Additional information has been taken from the Public Prosecutor’s
    indictment dated July 19, 1980 (published in the Enqelab Eslami and
    Jomhuri Eslami newspapers a day later). Having graduated from Ferdosi High
    School, Mr. Behruzfar joined the Air Force and became a fighter pilot. The
    sender of the electronic form remembers Mr. Behruzfar as a “true patriot.”
    He was reportedly involved in planning a coup d’état, known as Nojeh,
    which was never carried out. According to available information, the
    planners of the Nojeh coup were members of the armed forces and the Iran
    Party (social democrat and part of the Iranian National Front) who opposed
    the religious rule and believed in the separation of church and state. The
    core of the coup d’état plan was to fly aircrafts from Nojeh base in
    Hamedan and bomb some military targets as well as the residence of
    Ayatollah Khomeini. Another team was to take over the radio-television
    building in Tehran in order to announce the coup and expose the motives to
    the population. On July 9, 1980, the Islamic Republic of Iran authorities
    announced the discovering and dismantling of a civil and military network
    which had planned the coup d’état to overthrow the regime. Two months
    later, the organization Neghab, in a communiqué, claimed responsibility
    for this attempted ‘uprising.’ The Organization attested that ‘the path of
    Mossadegh is that of the people’ and today ‘Bakhtiar is its authentic
    leader… We have risen up to put an end to this curse [the Islamic regime]
    and to entrust the affairs of our land to the faithful disciple of
    Mossadegh – Shapur Bakhtiar’” (Iran: In Defense of Human Rights, National
    Movement of the Iranian Resistance, Paris, 1983). Following the discovery
    of the plan for the coup, more than sixty officers and civilians were
    executed in several cities of Iran in less than a month. Most of the
    officers were still active in the army and had not been swept away in the
    first wave of purges which took place in the army after the fall of the
    monarchy. Executions of individuals involved in the Nojeh coup continued
    in the months and years to come; at least 200 persons were executed in
    relations to the coup. Nureddin Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh
    Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet communist party) mentioned the coup d’état
    in an article dated May 2, 2000 posted on the Rah-e Tudeh website. Kianuri
    stressed the fact that the military branch of the Tudeh Party, which
    cooperated with the Islamic Republic’s authorities, discovered and
    “neutralized” the above mentioned Organization as well as other groups
    that planned a coup against the newly established regime. Arrest and
    detention No information is available on the circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial There is no information regarding
    this trial. Charges The Jomhuri Eslami newspaper announced the collective
    charge against Mr. Behruzfar and 10 other individuals to be participation
    in plotting a potential coup. The personal charge brought against Mr.
    Behruzfar is now known. In an indictment dated July 19, 1980, the Public
    Prosecutor said the following regarding some other participants of this
    alleged coup d’état plan: “These enthusiasts of the Shah’s rotten, filthy,
    and reactionary regime, these supporters of the blood-thirsty American
    imperialism, had in mind to bring ‘American social democracy’ as a gift to
    the liberated people of Iran. They had in mind to re-asses the opinion of
    our heroic nation about the return of the royal system through a
    referendum […].” The Public Prosecutor added: “This conspiracy was not
    planned in a vacuum and hence cannot be described in a single indictment;
    and these conspirators cannot be considered ordinary convicts… Considering
    that and by consulting the holy verses of the Koran regarding the
    punishment of the ‘rebel’ against the Islamic sovereign, it is imperative
    that the convicts receive their punishment according to the Shari’a law.”
    Evidence of guilt The newspaper report did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against the defendants. Defense No
    information is available regarding Mr. Behruzfar’s defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Court Martial condemned Mr. Mohammad Behruzfar to
    death. He was shot by a firing squad on July 31, 1980 at Evin prison.
