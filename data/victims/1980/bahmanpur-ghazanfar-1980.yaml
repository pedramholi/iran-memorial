    The execution of Colonel Ghazanfar Bahmanpur and 15 others was reported by
    the correspondents of the Jomhuri Eslami and Kayhan dailies in Shiraz
    (July 5, 1980). According to the Shiraz correspondent of the Enqelab
    Eslami daily of the same date, the religious judge who had attended the
    Friday Sermon in Shiraz spoke before performing the prayer while
    announcing the news: “As I was busy examining the cases of drug dealers,
    the President asked me in a telephone conversation to examine the cases of
    first rate criminals with political charges and issue the verdict based on
    the Shari’a law. I requested that the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor of
    Shiraz give us what they have at the Revolutionary Tribunal.
    Unfortunately, these cases were not passed on to us, and therefore I
    sentenced five people to death based on what was available at the prison
    or the Islamic Revolutionary Guards headquarters, and considering the
    testimonies of witnesses and unbiased individuals. One or two of these
    five people were already tried at the court and sentenced to life
    imprisonment, but I sentenced them to death, considering the crimes they
    had committed; and I did not think it was even that necessary to examine
    their cases, anyway. The death sentence was carried out today at dawn, and
    this was my Islamic and human duty and I have done my job in accordance
    with Shari’a standards.” The report of the Friday Sermon speech points to
    the fact that these executions caused disagreement among the clerics. In
    response to his critic, the religious judge said: “The gentleman who has
    been silent so far and has not shown the slightest reaction to the blood
    of our martyrs, has telephoned certain people last night, telling them
    that I have acted illegally. It must be said to him that it is none of his
    business. It would only be fair if I performed my duty to defrock this
    pseudo-cleric so that other pseudo-clerics do not dare present themselves
    against the Islamic nature of Iran.” Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this individual’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Based on the Jomhuri Eslami report, the religious judge traveled to
    Shiraz and, after visiting the Revolutionary Guard (Pasdaran) headquarters
    of Shiraz, headed for the Shiraz Tribunal, where he examined the cases of
    sixteen individuals charged with a range of crimes from killing and
    suppression of revolutionary combatants to drug dealing and sodomy. Col.
    Bahrampur, who was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz, was one of the defendants
    re-tired at this special court by the religious judge. Charges The Jomhuri
    Eslami report solely referred to Col. Bahrampur as a “torturer.” However,
    the Kayhan report specified that he was charged with “torturing and
    hurting university students” and “attacking the houses of Ayatollahs
    Dastgheib and Mahallati in February 4, 1964.” Evidence of guilt The
    reports contain no information regarding the evidence presented against
    the defendant at the trial. Defense No information is available on the
    defendant’s defense. Judgment Based on the Kayhan report, the defendant,
    previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Shiraz, was declared a “corruptor on earth” and sentenced to
    death at this special tribunal headed by the religious judge. The sentence
    was carried out immediately. The Jomhuri Eslami specifies that the
    sentence included confiscation of property for six of the accused. It is
    not clear whether or not Col. Bahrampur’s properties were confiscated.
