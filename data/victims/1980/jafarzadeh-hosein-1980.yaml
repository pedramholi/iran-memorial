circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Hosein Jafarzadeh and five others was reported from
    the Evin Prison by the correspondent of the Ettela at daily (January 29,
    1980). The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial The report only mentions that Mr.
    Jafarzadeh was tried at the fourth branch of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of the Center (Tehran). No specific information about the
    circumstances of the trial is available. Charges According to the report,
    the defendant was charged with armed robbery of the country s banks and
    shooting at criminal investigators. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the accused
    s defense. Judgment The fourth branch of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of the Center (Tehran) sentenced Mr. Jafarzadeh to death and he
    was executed at night in the Evin Prison.
