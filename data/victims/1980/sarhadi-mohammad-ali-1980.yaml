circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Sarhadi and another individual was
    reported by the Jomhuri Eslami daily correspondent in Mashhad (August 14,
    1980). Arrest and detention No information is available on the
    circumstances of Mr. Sarhadi s arrest and detention. Trial The defendant s
    case was examined in a special session of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Mashhad. No specific information about the trial is available
    in the report. Charges Based on the report, the defendant s charges were
    as follows: sodomy, bothering young boys and girls, preparing the ground
    for corruption, robbery, and having similar convictions. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentenced to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report did not provide any information on the evidence presented against
    the defendant. Defense No information on the accused s defense is
    available. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashhad found
    Mr. Sarhadi a corruptor on earth and an essentially corrupt individual and
    sentenced him to death. He was executed at dawn.
