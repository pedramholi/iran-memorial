circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Jan Mohammad Asadkhani and four others was announced
    in a communiqué of the Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecution Office of
    Mashhad, published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (July 9, 1980). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Asadkhani’s trial. Charges Based on the communiqué, the defendant was
    charged with “participation in carrying and distributing drugs.” Evidence
    of guilt The communiqué mentions that the defendant was arrested with 113
    kilograms of opium in his possession. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Asadkhani’s defense. Judgment Based on the communiqué, Mr.
    Asadkhani was declared a “corruptor on earth.” He was sentenced to death.
