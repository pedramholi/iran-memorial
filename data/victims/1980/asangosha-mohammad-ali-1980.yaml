    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Asangosha and 10 others was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily (July 31, 1980). He was reportedly involved in
    planning a coup d etat, known as Noje, which was never carried out. On
    July 7, 1980, the Islamic Republic of Iran authorities announced the
    discovery and dismantling of a civil and military network which had
    planned a coup d etat to overthrow the regime. Following this discovery,
    more than sixty officers and civilians were executed in several cities of
    Iran in less than a month. Most of the officers were still active in the
    army and had not been purged in the first wave of purges which took place
    within the file and ranks of the army after the fall of the monarchy. Two
    months later, the organization NEGHAB , in a communiqu , claimed
    responsibility for this attempted uprising. The organization attested that
    the path of Mossadegh is that of the people and today Bakhtiar is its
    authentic leader. We have risen up to put an end to this curse (the
    Islamic regime) and to entrust the affairs of our land to the faithful
    disciple of Mossadegh Shapour Bakhtiar. (Iran: In Defense of Human Rights,
    National Movement of the Iranian Resistance, Paris, 1983) Nureddin
    Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet
    communist party) mentions the coup d etat in an article dated May 2, 2000
    (www.rahetudeh.com). Kianuri stresses the fact that the military branch of
    the Tudeh , which cooperated with the Islamic Republic's authorities,
    discovered and "neutralized" the above mentioned organization as well as
    other groups that planned a coup against the newly established regime.
    Arrest and detention No information is available on the circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention. Trial The circumstances of the
    defendant s trial are unknown. Charges Besides participation in plotting a
    potential coup d etat, no charges were specified for this defendant. In a
    07/19/1980 indictment (published in the Enqelab Eslami and Jomhuri Eslami
    dailies, July 20, 1980), the Public Prosecutor said the following
    regarding some other participants of this failed coup d etat: These
    enthusiasts of the Shah s rotten, filthy, and reactionary regime, these
    supporters of the blood-thirsty American imperialism, had in mind to bring
    American social democracy as a gift to the liberated people of Iran. They
    had in mind to re-asses the opinion of our heroic nation about the return
    of the royal system through a referendum [ ]. He added: This conspiracy is
    not a single incident and these conspirators cannot be considered ordinary
    convicts. These are criminals who have undermined the newly-found truth,
    honor, and dignity of a liberated umma [community of Muslim people].
    Considering that and by consulting the holly verses of the Koran regarding
    the punishment of the rebel against the Islamic sovereign, it is
    imperative that the convicts receive their punishment according to the
    Shari'a law. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution provides no
    information about the evidence of guilt presented against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment
    The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Army sentenced Mr. Asangosha to
    death. He was executed at dawn.
