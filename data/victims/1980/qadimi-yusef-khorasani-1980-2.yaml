    Information regarding the life and disappearance of Mr. Yusef Khorasani
    Qadimi, son of Mirza Kuchak, is based on interviews conducted by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with people close to him. Mr. Khorasani
    Qadimi was born in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, on April 16, 1915. After
    completing his elementary education, he moved to Iran along with his
    family at the age of 15. Since he had graduated from high school with
    excellent grades, he received a state scholarship and went to Paris,
    France, to continue his education in management and banking. After
    returning to Iran, he became the Head of the Currency Department of the
    Bazar Branch of the Melli Bank. He was fluent in Russian, French, English,
    and Arabic. He married a French woman in 1954. According to his son, in
    addition to his government job, Mr. Khorasani Qadimi also participated in
    establishment and management of several economic and industrial
    institutions including Hassas Paper Corporation, and became representative
    of photocopy and Xerox companies from the Netherlands, Japan, and other
    countries. He went to Paris during the revolution and came back to Iran at
    the same time that Ayatollah Khomeini returned. Arrest and detention
    According to his son, Mr. Khorasani Qadimi was arrested on August 21,
    1980. The interviewee was informed by Baha i families who witnessed the
    arrest of the nine-member-circle of Baha is and their two advisors in
    Tehran that his father was among the arrested. This circle consisted of
    Abdolhossein Taslimi, Hushang Mahmudi, Ebrahim Rahmani, Dr. Hossein Naji,
    Manuchehr Qa m Maqami, General Ataollah Moqarebi, Yusef Khorasani Qadimi,
    Behiyeh Naderi, and Kambiz Sadeqzadeh. The advisors [assistants] were Dr.
    Yusef Abbasian and Dr. Heshmatollah Ruhani. The Maid Statements According
    to Mr. Khorasani Qadimi s maid, who was always present when the circle s
    meetings took place in the house, Usually, a daylong meeting took place at
    his three-floor building, number 9 at Mariam Street, parallel to
    Fereshteh, in Elahieh. (This house was confiscated without any court order
    several months after the arrest of the owner). Sometimes the meeting
    lasted until night. It was night when the last meeting ended and members
    of the circle left one at a time. They knew that some people were watching
    them around the house. During this meeting, they were talking about what
    to do about the deteriorating situation in the country. Mr. Khorasani
    Qadimi was the last person who put his pajamas in a bag and left. We did
    not see him again. Until his arrest, I only met him once and talked to him
    over a neighbor s phone once or twice. According to the house s maid, the
    surveillance of Mr. Khorasani Qadimi s house had been ongoing for some
    time. According to her, It was early winter in 1980 when tens of armed
    Revolutionary Guards entered the house, climbing walls and from the
    rooftop. First, they rang the bell and mentioned a Baha i s name so we
    opened the door. However, as soon as my son saw them, he closed the door
    and came inside. Only me, my son, and my daughter-in-law were at home and
    no one else was there. But there had been a meeting of all the circle s
    members the night before. During the short time we had, we called Mr.
    Khorasani Qadimi and informed him. When Revolutionary Guards entered the
    house, they began to forcibly search everywhere. They dropped and broke
    some items in the house. They collected documents and photo albums. They
    collected some antiques and valuables and whatever they wanted, and put
    them in their cars. They asked us where the safe was. They stayed until
    night fell and took whatever they wished. One of the Guards took a box
    containing gold belonging to Mr. Khorasani Qadimi s daughter and kept it
    under his arm wherever he went. Even when he was praying, he put it beside
    him. I told myself: This prayer is worth nothing, thief! I overheard
    another Guard talking on the phone who told someone that you have a lot of
    gifts tonight! According to the house s maid, The Guards thought that we
    knew where he was. We told them that we had no information, that we were
    only workers, and that they did not tell us anything. She added: Before
    the Guards left, they sealed everywhere except the kitchen and our room.
    After several days, another group came and searched everywhere again. They
    were a different group of Revolutionary Guards. Two months later, the
    third group of Revolutionary Guards came and housed three poor families in
    the house s rooms. One of these people was a prostitute who had repented
    and married a Guard. She was wicked and mischievous and harassed us a lot.
    According to the interviewee, this three-floor building was finally
    confiscated and she, her son, and her daughter-in-law were forced to
    leave. In an interview with the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation, the
    house maid described her last meeting with Mr. Khorasani Qadimi: After Mr.
    [Khorasani] Qadimi left his house to an unknown location, he called a
    neighbor several times and we talked. O
