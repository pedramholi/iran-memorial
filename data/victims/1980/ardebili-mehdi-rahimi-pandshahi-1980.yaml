    The execution of Mr. Mehdi Rahimi (Pandshahi Ardebili) was reported by the
    head of the Task Force for Combating Drugs and Narcotics in a conversation
    with the correspondent of Pars News Agency. The Jomhuri Eslami daily
    published the report (July 29, 1980). Arrest and detention According to
    the report, Mr. Rahimi was arrested by the Tehran police and detained in
    the Evin prison. Trial Mr.Rahimi's case was examined at the Special
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal for Combating Drugs and Narcotics. The
    tribunal held session at night. Charges The head of the Task Force
    specified that Mr. Rahimi was accused of being a professional,
    international drug dealer. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report does not
    contain any information regarding the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Rahimi was sentenced to death. The sentence was carried out
    immediately after the issuance of the verdict, a couple of hours past
    midnight.
