    The execution of Mr. Allahyar Kiani, son of Mohammad Ebrahim and a
    resident of Kian Nahavand (Hamedan province), along with 9 other
    individuals was reported by the correspondent of Pars New Agency, quoting
    the religious judge of the Anti-Narcotic Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals.
    The Jomhuri Eslami newspaper published the report on July 24, 1980. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    remain unknown. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. Charges Reportedly, the defendant was very active in drug
    trafficking across the country. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt Based on the report, the
    defendant was arrested with 10 kilograms of opium. Defense No information
    is available on the defense. Judgment The religious judge of the
    Anti-Narcotic Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Allahyar Kiani
    to death. He was executed early in the morning on Wednesday July 23, 1980.
