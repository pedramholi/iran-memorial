    The information about Lieutenant Naser Rokni has been drawn from an
    interview with a relative. This execution was announced on the website of
    the Iranian Imperial Air Force. Additional information has been taken from
    the Public Prosecutor’s indictment dated July 19, 1980 (published in the
    Enqelab Eslami and Jomhuri Eslami newspapers a day later). Mr. Rokni’s
    mother (Ms. Bibi Farokh Bikbakht) as well as his brother-in-law (Majid
    Vesali) were executed for links to the attempted Nojeh coup. According to
    available information, the planners of the Nojeh coup were members of the
    armed forces and the Iran Party (social democrat and part of the Iranian
    National Front) who opposed the religious rule and believed in the
    separation of church and state. The core of the coup d’état plan was to
    fly aircrafts from Nojeh base in Hamedan and bomb some military targets as
    well as the residence of Ayatollah Khomeini. Another team was to take over
    the radio-television building in Tehran in order to announce the coup and
    expose the motives to the population. On July 9, 1980, the Islamic
    Republic of Iran authorities announced the discovering and dismantling of
    a civil and military network which had planned the coup d’état to
    overthrow the regime. Two months later, the organization Neghab, in a
    communiqué, claimed responsibility for this attempted ‘uprising.’ The
    Organization attested that ‘the path of Mossadegh is that of the people’
    and today ‘Bakhtiar is its authentic leader… We have risen up to put an
    end to this curse [the Islamic regime] and to entrust the affairs of our
    land to the faithful disciple of Mossadegh – Shapur Bakhtiar’” (Iran: In
    Defense of Human Rights, National Movement of the Iranian Resistance,
    Paris, 1983). Following the discovery of the plan for the coup, more than
    sixty officers and civilians were executed in several cities of Iran in
    less than a month. Most of the officers were still active in the army and
    had not been swept away in the first wave of purges which took place in
    the army after the fall of the monarchy. Executions of individuals
    involved in the Nojeh coup continued in the months and years to come; at
    least 200 persons were executed in relations to the coup. Nureddin
    Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet
    communist party) mentioned the coup d’état in an article dated May 2, 2000
    posted on the Rah-e Tudeh website. Kianuri stressed the fact that the
    military branch of the Tudeh Party, which cooperated with the Islamic
    Republic’s authorities, discovered and “neutralized” the above mentioned
    Organization as well as other groups that planned a coup against the newly
    established regime. Arrest and detention No information is available on
    the circumstances of Lt. Rokni’s arrest and detention. Trial There is no
    information regarding this trial. Charges The charge brought against Lt.
    Naser Rokni is not known. In an indictment dated July 19, 1980, the Public
    Prosecutor said the following regarding some other participants of this
    alleged coup d’état plan: “These enthusiasts of the Shah’s rotten, filthy,
    and reactionary regime, these supporters of the blood-thirsty American
    imperialism, had in mind to bring ‘American social democracy’ as a gift to
    the liberated people of Iran. They had in mind to re-asses the opinion of
    our heroic nation about the return of the royal system through a
    referendum […].” The Public Prosecutor added: “This conspiracy was not
    planned in a vacuum and hence cannot be described in a single indictment;
    and these conspirators cannot be considered ordinary convicts… Considering
    that and by consulting the holy verses of the Koran regarding the
    punishment of the ‘rebel’ against the Islamic sovereign, it is imperative
    that the convicts receive their punishment according to the Shari’a law.”
    Evidence of guilt The newspaper report did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against the defendants. Defense No
    information is available regarding Lt. Rokni’s defense. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the verdict leading to this
    execution. According to the Iranian Imperial Air Force’s website, Lt.
    Naser Rokni was executed in Tehran on August 7, 1980.
