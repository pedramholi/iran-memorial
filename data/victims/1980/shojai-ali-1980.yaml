    The Prosecutor General of the Islamic Revolution announced the execution
    of Mr. Ali Shoja'i, along with two other individuals, in a communiqué
    published on May 8, 1980. The daily Enqelab-e Eslami reported the news the
    same day, quoting the Prosecutor's communiqué. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    defendant was charged with "hiding and distributing opium and heroin." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ali Shoja'i's defense. Judgment The Prosecutor communiqué
    stated that the defendant was declared a "corruptor on earth" and
    sentenced to death. The sentence was carried out at dawn.
