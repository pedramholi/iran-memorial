    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Ghiyasi was reported by Pars News Agency.

    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Based on the report, Mr. Ghiyasi was charged with the following:
    establishing an opium den , forcing his own wife to sell her body , and
    espionage for Iraq. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information
    is available regarding the evidence provided to prove any of the
    above-mentioned charges. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Ghiyasi s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Qasr e
    Shirin and Sar e Pol e Zahab found Mr. Ghiyasi guilty of corruption on
    earth. He was executed at 10:30 p.m.
