circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mansur Zekavat was reported by the correspondent of
    Pars News Agency in Ahvaz. The report was published in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily (July 26, 1980) Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are unknown. Trial No specific
    information about the circumstances of the trial is available. Charges The
    report quoted the news headquarters of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards,
    which announced the defendant s charges as being a first-rate seller of
    drugs and distributing heroin among the youth. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report specifies that Mr. Zekavat had confessed to having distributed
    heroin among the youth but provides no further information about the
    evidence presented against him. Defense No information is available on the
    defendant s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor
    of Dezful sentenced Mr. Zekavat to death. He stood before the firing squad
    at dawn.
