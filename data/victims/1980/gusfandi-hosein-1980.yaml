circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Hosein Gusfandi was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily (July 26, 1980) Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are unknown. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Gusfandi s trial. Charges According to the report, Mr.
    Gusfandi was charged with being a sodomite, one who indulges in
    extramarital sexual relationships, and an anti-revolutionary. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report does not contain any information
    about the evidence presented against the victim. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Dezful sentenced Mr. Gusfandi to death, and he was executed in
    the morning.
