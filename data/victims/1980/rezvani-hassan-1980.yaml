    News of the execution of Colonel Hassan Rezvani, son of Sadeq, was
    reported by a correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Zahedan on
    August 5, 1980. Additional information is based on an electronic form sent
    to Omid by a person familiar with his case. According to this information,
    he was born in Varazan, Mazandaran. He was married with five children and
    was a graduate of a military college. When he was young, he became an
    intelligence officer and, after the secret police organization (SAVAK) was
    established, he began working there and served in Kerman Province. In 1966
    he was transferred to Sistan Va Baluchestan Province, where he served as
    the head of SAVAK. He was in Zahedan until arrested. Arrest and Detention
    According to the information sent to Omid, Colonel Rezvani was arrested by
    agents of the Tehran-Pars Komiteh at his residence in Tehran in 1980.
    Reportedly, he had connections with top-ranking officials of the Islamic
    Republic, who gave him verbal assurance of immunity. During a visitation
    with his family in Tehran, he referred to his broken arm and stated that
    he fell from his bed. He was last detained in the Revolutionary Prison in
    Zahedan, where he had worked as the head of SAVAK. Colonel Rezvani was
    denied the right to an attorney. Trial According to the daily report of
    Jomhuri Eslami , the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Sistan Va Baluchestan,
    headed by the religious judge, went into session to address Colonel
    Rezvani s case on July 31, 1980, at 9 a.m. According to the information
    sent to Omid, this session took place at the location of SAVAK
    headquarters and lasted for half a day. Charges The charge against the
    defendant, as reported by the newspaper, was: Willingly serving the
    disgusting Pahlavi regime through 23 years of work with the army and the
    SAVAK. According to the information sent to Omid, authorities asked
    Colonel Rezvani Why was no one hurt during your thirteen years service as
    the head of SAVAK? You caused a delay for the revolution! The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt
    According to the information sent, no evidence was provided against
    Colonel Rezvani, and none of the witnesses introduced by the Public
    Prosecutor s Office knew him. Defense No information is available about
    Colonel Rezvani s defense. According to the information sent to Omid,
    people in Zahedan signed a petition in support of him, which stated that
    no one had any complaint against him. During an interview with reporters,
    the case interrogator stated that, in spite all the good things people
    told [the court] about Mr. Rezvani, he had been ordered to condemn him to
    death. This interrogator was changed, and the new one swiftly condemned
    Mr. Rezvani and sent him to be executed. Judgment According to the daily
    report, the Revolutionary Tribunal of Sistan Va Baluchestan identified
    Colonel Hassan Rezvani as Mofsed [corruptor on Earth] and Mohareb [waging
    war] against God, his prophet and his people and sentenced him to death.
    The ruling was carried out, and he was executed on July 31, 1980, at 4:00
    p.m. on the day of his trial. According to the information sent to Omid,
    he was executed by firing squad at Zahedan garrison. His brother, Colonel
    Naser Rezvani, who was a commander of fighter aircraft during the war with
    Iraq, was able to get permission to move the body of his brother to his
    birth place. The body of Colonel Hassan Rezvani was taken to Tehran by a
    plane and then to Varazan in Mazandaran by car and buried at the
    Hosseinieh of the village.
