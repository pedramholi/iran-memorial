circumstances: >
    The execution of Seyed Hossein Taleqani and two other convicts was
    reported in the Ettela at daily (March 26, 1980). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The report mentioned that examining Mr. Taleqani s and the other
    defendants cases took several sessions at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Dezful. Charges Based on the report, Mr. Taleqani was charged
    with extramarital sexual relationships, raping married women and the
    daughters of the disinherited social groups, conspiring with the police
    and the Judiciary, owning a tavern and a House of Pleasure, seizing
    personal and endowed properties, and armed assault to the disinherited and
    violating their rights. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    available on the evidence presented against the victim. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Taleqani s defense. Judgment According to
    the report, Mr. Abdizadeh was found guilty of corruption on earth. He was
    sentenced to death and confiscation of his belongings as well as those of
    his immediate family s after paying off their documented debts to Dezful s
    Organization of the Disinherited. The death sentence was carried out about
