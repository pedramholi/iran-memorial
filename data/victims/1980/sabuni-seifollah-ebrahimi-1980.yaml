    The execution of Mr. Seifollah Ebrahimi (Sabuni) was reported by the head
    of the Task Force for Combating Drugs and Narcotics in a conversation with
    the correspondent of Pars News Agency. The Jomhuri Eslami daily published
    the report (July 29, 1980). Arrest and detention According to the report,
    the police narcotics agents had been trying to arrest Mr. Ebrahimi for a
    long time since he had escaped prison, wherein he was sentenced to life,
    at the time of the Revolution. Trial Based on the report, Mr. Ebrahimi s
    case was examined at the Special Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal for
    Combating Drugs and Narcotics. The tribunal held session at the night of
    the execution. Charges The head of the Task Force specified that Mr.
    Ebrahimi was accused of being a famous smuggler. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report does not
    contain any information regarding the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Ebrahimi was sentenced to death. The sentence was carried out
    immediately after the issuance of the verdict, a couple of hours past
    midnight.
