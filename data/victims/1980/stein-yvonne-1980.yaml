    Yvonne Stein is one of two individuals killed during the assassination
    attempt of Shapour Bakhtiar, which took place on July 18, 1980 in the
    suburb of Paris, Neuilly sur Seine. The information concerning this
    assassination attempt was collected by the French press ( Le Figaro July
    19, 1980, France Soir July 18,1980 and July 19,1980, Le Monde July 19,
    1980, February 27, 1982, March 5, 1982, March 12, 1982, L Express from
    June 14 to June 20, 1980 and of July 26, 1980 to August 1, 1980). A
    five-member terrorist commando group composed of: Anis Naccache, a
    Lebanese Christian; Nejad Tabrizi, an Iranian member of the Revolutionary
    Guards Corp; Fawzi El Satari, a Palestinian; along with Salah Eddine El
    Kaara and Mohamed Jenab, either Syrian or Lebanese according to different
    sources, carried out the July 18, 1980 attack at the apartment building in
    Neuilly sur Seine where Shapour Bakhtiar resided. The commando group
    arrived at the building at 8:45 am, carrying silencer guns and press cards
    from the newspaper L Humanit (affiliated to the French Communist Party).
    The police officers assigned to Bakhtiar s protection allowed them to
    enter lobby where another office was in charge of informing Bakhtiar of
    visitors using the intercom. Before he could call Bakhtiar s apartment,
    the guard was shot. The commando group reached the second floor, where
    Bakhtiar s apartment was located, and mistakenly knocked on his neighbor s
    door. The commando shot Yvonne Stein dead as soon as she opened the door
    and also wounded her sister. When the commando finally rang the door bell
    of Bakhtiar s apartment, the latter s cousin, suspicious of the early-hour
    visit, attached the door s security chain before opening it. The commando
    shot through the door crack but failed to gain access to the apartment and
    complete its mission. The members of the commando group were arrested as
    they were leaving the building. They were detained and interrogated by the
    French police. At all stages of the judicial process, they claimed
    responsibility for their acts. They were charged with murder by the
    Criminal Court of Hauts de Seine, which held its hearings from February 5
    to March 10, 1982. The accused refused to attend their trial (except for
    one hearing), deeming the Court incompetent, since, according to them,
    only Allah is a judge . All the members of the commando were sentenced to
    life imprisonment except for Fawzi El Satari who was sentenced to twenty
    years imprisonment. Yvonne Stein s name is in OMID along with victims of
    violations of human rights by the Islamic Republic of Iran, because the
    available information indicates that she was shot by agents of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran in the course of the assassination attempt against Shapur
    Bakhtiar. Responsibility for the assassination attempt was claimed by
    Iranian authorities. During the only hearing he attended, the head of the
    commando group, Naccache, argued that the assassination plan was based on
    a verdict issued by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal in Tehran. ( Le
    Monde , March 10, 1982) Responsibility for Shapour Bakhtiar s
    assassination attempt was claimed immediately on July 19, 1980 in a
    communiqu issued by the Revolutionary Guards and read on the official
    Radio-Tehran. In an interview given to Express magazine and published
    during the week of June 14-20, 1980, Ayatollah Khalkhali, designated by
    Khomeini as the Head of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal, stated that
    Bakhtiar was on his blacklist and that a commando group was in charge of
    killing him (p 141). Le Figaro on July 19, 1980, also mentioned the list
    including Bakhtiar s name as well as some relatives of the former Shah.
    Khalkhali said: "I have sent a commando to get him, he can not escape us".
    Furthermore, in an interview given to the newspaper Le Monde on December
    1, 1992, Anis Naccache explained that "At the time, killing the former
    Prime Minster of the Shah was a political necessity and was legally
    justified". Anis Naccache made the headline news again during a bombing
    campaign that hit France between February 1985 and May 1986 killing 14 and
    injuring 335 people. Responsibility for these attacks was claimed by
    Islamist groups close to the Lebanese Hezbollah, to whom the Islamic
    Republic provides ideological guidance and logistical support. In their
    claims, those responsible for the bombings called for the liberation of
    three individuals imprisoned in France, including Anis Naccache of the
    Jihad (Didier Bigo in Culture and Conflicts n 4 (1992) pp. 147-173). On
    July 27, 1990, President Mitterand pardoned Anis Naccache, the leader of
    the commando group and his accomplices. Naccache left for Tehran and has
    reportedly lived between the Iranian capital and Beirut ever since. On
    August 6, 1991 Shapour Bakhtiar, and his assistant, Soroush Katibeh, were
    assassinated in Suresnes (a Paris suburb where Bakhtiar moved after the
    1980 attempt on his life). The assassination was carried out by members of
    the Islamic Republic Revolutionary Gu
