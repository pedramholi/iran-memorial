    Information about the execution of Mr. Yadollah (also spelled "
    Yadu'llah") Astani, son of Ahmad, and fourteen others was obtained from a
    ruling by Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz published in Kayhan Daily
    Newspaper (July 14th, 1980; July 16, 1980), Jomhuri Eslami Newspaper (July
    15th, 1980), Ettela at Newspaper (July 15th, 1980), Sobh-e Azadegan
    Newspaper (July 15th, 1980), and Bamdad Newspaper (July 15th, 1980).
    Additional information about his life was acquired from Archives of Baha i
    Persecution, including a brief biography and a letter from his wife,
    Nayyereh Astani, to Judge Musavi (November 7th, 1979). Mr. Astani is also
    one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the
    Baha i International Community. The report documents the persecution of
    the members of the Baha i faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists
    members killed since 1978. Additional information has been drawn from
    various issues of The Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986,
    Haifa 1994. Mr. Yadollah Astani was born in 1931 in Maragheh, East
    Azerbaijan province, Iran (ABPI). He established his own business in
    Maragheh, following his graduation from high school. Then, when he moved
    to Tabriz later, he moved his business with him (ABPI). He was elected to
    serve on the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tabriz in 1969 (ABPI). The Baha
    is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the
    Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious
    community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300
    thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Baha i National Spiritual Assembly After the
    Islamic Revolution In the organizational structure of the Baha i
    community, the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly is a body
    composed of nine individuals that are elected annually with the votes of
    adult Baha is in each country. This institution tends to the affairs and
    issues of the Baha i community on the national level. The National
    Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of guiding, coordinating, and
    moving forward the activities of each country s local spiritual
    assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl ( House of Justice
    ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the highest
    decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I s
    Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual
    assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz,
    were severely persecuted and the majority of their members were executed.
    In The Final Message of the Iran National Spiritual Assembly to the
    Friends of the Country , the Third Baha i National Spiritual Assembly,
    abiding by the principle of obeying the government, announced the closure
    of the Baha i organizations, and at the same time, sent an open letter to
    two thousand well-known and high-ranking government figures asking an end
    to the arrest, detention, torture, execution, and injustice against Baha
    is. (BBC Persian website, October 11, 2015). Judicial officials of the
    Islamic Republic have come up with [unreasonable and unacceptable]
    justifications for the persecution and the execution of the members of the
    National Spiritual Assemblies. In a speech on May 28, 1982, Ayatollah
    Khomeini said: The Baha is are not a religion, they re a [political]
    party; it s a party that was supported by Britain in the
