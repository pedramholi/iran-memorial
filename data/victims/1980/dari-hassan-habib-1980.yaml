    The execution of Mr. Hasan Dari and two others convicted of participation
    in an unrealized coup d’etat plan known as Noje was reported by the
    correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Isfahan (August 18, 1980). In
    his 07/19/1980 indictment (published in the Enqelab Eslami and Jomhuri
    Eslami dailies, July 20, 1980), the public prosecutor provided the
    following “necessary explanation” about some other participants of this
    coup d’etat that was never put to practice: “This conspiracy is not a
    single incident and these conspirators cannot be considered ordinary
    convicts. These are criminals who have undermined the newly-found truth,
    honor, and dignity of a liberated umma [community of Muslim people].
    Considering that and by consulting the holly verses of the Koran regarding
    the punishment of the ‘rebel’ against the Islamic sovereign, it is
    imperative that the convicts receive their punishment according to the
    Shari’a law.” According to previous reports and communiqués (Jomhuri
    Eslami daily, July 20 and 31, 1980), the network involved in the planning
    of the coup d’etat consisted of both military and civilian members. Arrest
    and detention No information is available on the circumstances of Mr.
    Dari’s arrest and detention. Trial Based on the report, the Second Special
    Branch of the Army’s Office of Prosecution held session in Isfahan on
    Thursday evening, 08/14/80, to try seven civilians allegedly involved in
    planning the above-mentioned coup d’etat. The reading of the indictment by
    the Army’s public prosecutor was preceded by the recitation of a few lines
    from the Holy Koran. The trial lasted 5 hours. Charges According to this
    report, the defendants were collectively accused of plotting a potential
    coup d’etat. Although the report does not provide any specific information
    on this un-launched coup d’etat plot, a previous communiqué of the Army’s
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal (Jomhuri Eslami daily, July 20, 1980)
    indicates that the coup d'etat was intended to establish an "American
    social democratic" regime and to organize a referendum so that people
    could decide on the nature of the political regime. Evidence of guilt The
    report does not provide any information on the evidence presented against
    the defendant. Defense No information on the accused’s defense is
    available. Judgment The Second Special Branch of the Army’s Office of
    Prosecution in Isfahan sentenced Mr. Dari to death. The sentence was
    carried immediately on the night of the trial.
