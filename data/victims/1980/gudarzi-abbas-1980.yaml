    with being one of the drug distributors and famous dealers of the region.

    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.

    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report contains no information regarding
