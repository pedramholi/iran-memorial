    The execution of Mr. Heshmatollah Rohani was announced by the spokesman of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz in a conversation with the
    correspondent of Pars News Agency. The Jomhuri Eslami daily published the
    announcement (July 30, 1980). Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Based on the report, Mr.
    Rohani was charged with distributing heroin , riot in the prison , and
    destroying public property. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Ruhani s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz
    sentenced Mr. Rohani to death, and he was executed.
