    The execution of Mr. Reza Zera'i, son of Ahmad and resident of Aligudarz

    trial, other than Mr. Zare i was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Hamedan. Charges Mr. Zera'i and his two co-defendants were
    collectively charged with purchasing and selling heroin. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available concerning Zera'i s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Hamedan declared Mr. Zera'i
    a corruptor on earth and condemned him to death. Mr. Reza Zera'i and two
    other persons were executed at dawn on Thursday July 30, 1980 in Hamedan.
