circumstances: >
    Mr. Andacheh was a farmer, known now in Iran s history for his part in a
    rued revival. The execution of Mr. Gholamhosein Andacheh, a farmer, was
    reported along with four others to Pars News Agency by the news center of
    the Revolutionary Guard (Pasdaran) headquarters of Kerman. The Jomhuri
    Eslami daily published the report (July 5, 1980). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    report mentioned that Mr. Andacheh was arrested by the gendarmerie agents.
    However, the circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Andacheh s trial. Charges Based
    on the report, Mr. Andacheh was charged with deluding a 10-year-old girl
    and raping her. Evidence of guilt The report did not provide any
    information regarding the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment
    Based on the report, the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman
    sentenced Mr. Andacheh and three other defendants to death by stoning.
    They were stoned to death at 5:30 in the morning. Article 104 of the
    Islamic Republic's Penal Code states that ''...the stones should not be
    too large so that the person dies on being hit by one or two of them...''
    and this punishment , according to Amnesty International "is designed to
    cause grievous pain leading to eventual death." According to Reuters news
    agency, quoting one of the members of Kerman's Tribunal speaking on
    condition of anonymity, the victims were given ablution before the
    ceremony and were given white tunics to wear. Their heads were covered
    with a hood. They were then buried up to their chests, and stones of
    various dimensions were made available. The President of the Tribunal
    personally threw the first stone, followed by five other people. The
    stoning lasted fifteen minutes.
