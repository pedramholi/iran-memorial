    News of the execution of Mr. Shokrollah Daneshyar, along with two others,
    was published in the Peykar publication (number 79, November 3, 1980) and
    in the War Newsletter (Peykar, special issue number 6, November 6, 1980).
    Mr. Daneshyar is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list
    of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains
    the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Mr. Daneshyar was a sympathizer of this organization in
    Abadan. He was in charge of the Peykar’s tents in Abadan, set up to help
    those displaced due to the Iran-Iraq War. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Daneshyar was arrested in the Peykar’s tents in Abadan on September
    24, 1980. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to the Peykar publication, the charge against Mr.
    Daneshyar was “being in charge of Peykar’s tents in Abadan, set up to help
    the displaced persons.” The Andeesheh va Peykar website states that he was
    charged with speech opposing the war. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Daneshyar’s defense. Judgment Mr. Daneshyar was executed by firing squad
    in Abadan on October 19, 1980.
