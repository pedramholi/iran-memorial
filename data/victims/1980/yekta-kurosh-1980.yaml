    The information about Mr. Kurosh Yekta is taken from the book Our Martyrs
    for Freedom and Socialism by Rah-e Kargar Publications. He was born in
    Kuchesfahan (near Rasht in Gilan province). While he was a high school
    student, he became a sympathizer of the Revolutionary Workers Organization
    of Iran, Rah-e Kargar. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They
    identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Kurosh Yekta was never arrested. Trial Mr. Kurosh Yekta did not have a
    trial. Charges No official charges have been brought against Mr. Kurosh
    Yekta. Defense Mr. Kurosh Yekta did not have the opportunity to defend
    himself. Judgment On July 24, 1980, the Revolutionary Guards shot him
    through the spinal cord during a demonstration. He died in the hospital on
    September 22, 1980. Next day, a huge group of people participated in his
    funeral procession. The Hezbollahis broke his tombstone several times.
    Whether or not the security forces had orders to shoot the demonstrators
    is not known.
