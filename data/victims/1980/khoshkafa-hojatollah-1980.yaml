    He was a 13-year-old middle school student at Ashraf Mahesht School in
    Andimeshk. Information regarding the Arbitrary execution of Mr. Hojatollah
    Khoshkafa, along with five others, and news of the execution of 16 others
    was gathered from two interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center (ABC). One interview was with a participant in the Andimeshk
    protest of March 1980 (April 15, 2024), and the other was with a political
    activist of the time (April 13, 2024), as well as a statement by
    Khomeini's representative published in the Bamdad newspaper (March 30,
    1980), quoted by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of Dezful,
    and announcements by the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Dezful, reported
    in Jomhouri-e Eslami newspaper (July 27, 1980) and Kayhan newspaper (March
    17 and July 26, 1980). Additional information was also taken from the
    IRGC's publicity in the Jomhouri-e Eslami, Ettela'at, and Enqelab-e Eslami
    newspapers (March 17, 1980); Peykar Magazine, the publication of the
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class (April 1 and
    15, May 5, and September 29, 1980); Andisheh and Peykar (August 20-23);
    Kar, the publication of the Organization of Iranian People's Fedai
    Guerrillas - Minority; and several websites, including Jahan-e Novin
    (March 1980), Akhbar-e Rooz (by Mokhtar Shalalvand, June 4, 2012), Nedaye
    Azadi (by Fariba Marzban, September 27, 2013), and Pezhvak-e Iran (by Iraj
    Mesdaghi and Musa Hatamian, August 9, 2017). Mr. Hojatollah Khoshkafa is
    also one of the 430 people listed as martyrs of the Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class, according to the Andisheh and
    Peykar website. The list includes the names of Peykar members, more than
    400 of whom were executed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Hojatollah
    Khoshkafa, a 13-year-old middle school student at Ashraf Mahesht School,
    was a follower of the Peykar organization*. He was an active member of the
    organization's student union in Andimeshk, where he helped distribute its
    publications. He also had a talent for graphic design. Mr. Khoshkafa took
    part in a peaceful protest organized by the "Independent Union of the
    Unemployed" in Andimeshk's Railway Square on March 15, 1980. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China
    had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed
    all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. 1980 Andimeshk
    Protest Less than a year after the 1979 revolution, an atmosphere of hope
    emerged among young people seeking justice and social rights. During this
    period, there were numerous protests in cities such as Tehran, Tabriz,
    Mahabad, Sari, Amol, Shiraz, Isfahan, Ilam, Gonbad Kavus, Rasht and
    Abadan, where demonstrators demanded jobs and economic rights. Unemployed
    youth in various regions sought to organize their employment-related
    issues by forming independent associations or unions, free from political
    affiliations. In Tabriz, for example, the " Graduate and Post-Graduate
    Union" was formed, which successfully held meetings with provincial
    authorities and received official recognition from the provincial
    government, allowing it to pursue its goals. Similar organizations in
    other cities, however, faced harsh repression. In one notable incident,
    one person was killed and four others were injured during a crackdown on
    protests by unemployed workers in Isfahan. Unemployed workers'
    associations in Dorud and Andimeshk were also violently repressed. At the
    time, Andimeshk's population had increased due to an influx of migrants
    and wartime displacement, exacerbating social problems in the area. The
    Independent Union of the Unemployed in Andimeshk was founded after the
    1979 revolution with a focus on workers' rights. It aimed to defend the
    right to work and to protest "appointed hiring practices in state
    institutions and the interference of Islamic associations in employment
    decisions. Early on, union representatives negotiated with the mayor, who
    gave them a room in the city hall. This space became their official
    headquarters and helped them organize their efforts more effectively.
    Union members gathered there daily to hold meetings and send letters to
    Andimeshk authorities demanding jobs for the city's unemployed. Des
