circumstances: >
    The execution of Ms. Farideh Baba'i and Mr. Hedayat Musavizadeh was
    reported in the Ettela at daily (Jan 7, 1980). Arrest and detention No
    information is available on the circumstances of Ms. Baba'i s arrest and
    detention. Trial The report did not provide any information regarding Ms.
    Baba'i s trial. Charges According to the report, the defendant was charged
    with adultery and committing acts incompatible with chastity. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information about the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense The report provides no
    information about Ms. Baba'i s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Ardebil sentenced Ms. Farideh Baba'i to death, she was
    executed by firing squad in Ardebil on January 07, 1980. According to the
    report, however, after hours of being in the morgue it became apparent
    that she was still alive. Based on the court order, she was executed again
    by a revolutionary guard (Pasdar) who shot her in the morgue.
