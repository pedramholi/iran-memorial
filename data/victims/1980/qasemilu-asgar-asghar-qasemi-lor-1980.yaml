    News of the execution of Mr. Asgar (Asghar) Qasemi Lor (Qasemlu), son of
    Hossein, along with 11 other individuals was published by numerous
    sources, including Ettela at and Kayhan newspaper (archives) on January
    12, 1980. Additional information about this case was obtained from
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s research. Mr. Qasemi Lor was a member of
    the Muslim People's Republic Party. According to available information,
    his case was related to a charge of Efsad fel-Arz ( Spreading corruption
    on Earth ). The Muslim People's Republic Party The Muslim People's
    Republic Party (MPRP), more commonly known as the Moslem People s Party,
    was founded in March 1979 with the blessing and support of the influential
    Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari. The aim of the MPRP s
    founding members, which included Ayatollah Shariatmadari s son, Hassan,
    was to bring together more enlightened Muslim forces and work towards an
    ideal progressive society. Its guiding principles were written with an eye
    to ensuring the guidance of Islam in all aspects of life, the immutable
    role of citizens voices in shaping and running their own government, and
    the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic on the global stage.[1] The party
    was based in Tabriz and had a strong and diverse following in Western and
    Eastern Azerbaijan, as well as in cities such as Qom, Tehran, Ardebil and
    Mashhad.[2] The MPRP called on its members to vote yes in the March 1979
    Referendum to establish an Islamic Republic, but criticized the absence of
    the rule of law and abuses of power by some of Ayatollah Khomeini s
    supporters. Chief among the galvanizing forces for the party of
    Shariatmadari s followers was opposition to the concept of velayat-e faqih
    (guardianship of the theologian), which, if written into the constitution,
    would place ultimate executive power in the hands of the Supreme Leader.
    Though some of the party s founding members would resign after its
    decision to boycott the August 1979 election of the Assembly of
    Constitutional Experts a cleric-contingent governing body supplanting the
    anticipated, more representative constitutive assembly the MPRP movement
    maintained the solidarity and numbers necessary to make heard their
    demands of increased local autonomy in Azerbaijan, popular sovereignty,
    and corresponding revisions to the constitution. In December of 1979, the
    party boycotted the referendum on the draft constitution, and continued
    after the referendum to advocate for changes to key constitutional
    articles. Starting in December of 1979 and for close to six weeks,
    demonstrations in support of the MPIRP and Ayatollah Shariatmadari clashed
    with Ayatollah Khomeini s followers and the provisional government, as the
    latter moved swiftly to quash the former s influence across Iran. Due to
    its history of embattled minority rights, Azerbaijan was a particular
    hotspot for escalating conflicts over constitutional representation.
    Ayatollah Shariatmadari had strong support among armed forces there, and
    MPRP was demanding that he vet the nominations of local officials.
    Nonetheless, the MPIRP s influence was far from localized, and Ayatollah
    Khomeini s cohort would aggressively suppress it. A convergence of
    pro-Shariatmadari demonstrators and pro-Khomeini counter protesters
    outside Ayatollah Shariatmadari s house in Qom on December 5 ended in the
    shooting death of one of Shariatmadari s guards; systematic censorship of
    Ayatollah Shariatmadari s statements in the media led to MPRP takeovers of
    government buildings and the National Broadcasting station in Tabriz
    December 6 - 11, amid clashes that killed and wounded several people.
    Widespread unrest continued as Ayatollah Khomeini and the Revolutionary
    Council continued to ignore MPRP demands. By January of 1980, government
    forces had managed to crush the swell of the MPRP, killing at least 20 and
    injuring hundreds in the process The party was banned and scores of its
    members executed, imprisoned, or forced into exile.[3] Arrest and
    detention Mr. Qasemi Lor was arrested on the night of January 11, 1980, in
