    The execution of Ms. Soghra Maleki Kuhpayeh, known as Soghra Nasir, and
    two others was reported by the Jomhuri Eslami daily correspondent in
    Kerman (August 14, 1980). Arrest and detention No information is available
    on the circumstances of Ms. Maleki s arrest and detention. Trial No
    specific information on the trial is available in the report. Charges
    Based on the report, the defendant s charges were as follows: repeated
    counts of robbery, committing anti-Islamic acts, possessing drugs and
    alcoholic beverages, establishing brothels, and promoting prostitution.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentenced to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report did not provide any information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information on
    the accused s defense is available. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Kerman declared Ms. Maleki a corruptor on earth and sentenced
    her to death.
