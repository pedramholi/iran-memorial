    She was in Ahvaz, working at the National Petroleum Co., when the Cultural
    Revolution launched. Ms. Mo tamedi, in opposition, made her way to the
    university campus. News of the execution of Ms. Mahnaz Mo tamedi was
    published in the Peykar publication, number 55, on September 20, 1980. Ms.
    Mo tamedi is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of
    Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the
    names of those members of the organization who died after the revolution
    of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed.
    The public prosecutor of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Khuzestan
    Province issued a communiqu about her, without mentioning her name. The
    Ettela at newspaper published this communiqu on April 30, 1980. Ms. Mo
    tamedi was an employee of the National Petroleum Company in Ahvaz. The
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by
    a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state, believed that China
    had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed
    all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    Ms. Mo tamedi was arrested during the regime s agents attack on Ahvaz
    University at the outset of the Cultural Revolution. The Cultural
    Revolution began after Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech in March 1980 and
    ordered that universities be purged of all those who opposed his regime
    and be transformed into learning environments [as opposed to political
    forums] where an all-Islamic curriculum would be taught. The first wave of
    violence began on April 15, 1980 during a speech by Akbar Hashemi
    Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister
    of Interior] at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech, students
    supporting the regime took control of the University s central building
    and demanded that the university be purged from pro-Shah elements and
    other sellouts. On April 18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution issued
    a communiqu accusing political groups of converting higher education
    institutions into headquarters of discordant political activities and
    naming them as obstacles to the radical transformation of the
    universities. The communiqu gave these groups three days (Saturday April
    19 to Monday April 21) to shut down their activities in the universities.
    The Council stressed that the decision included libraries along with
    activities related to arts and sports. Political groups, which recruited
    members and had strong support in the universities, refused to evacuate.
    Before the Council s deadline, serious clashes took place between leftist
    groups and Islamist Associations, which were at times supported by
    security forces and paramilitary groups. These clashes, which peaked at
    the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in the death of several people
    and hundreds of others were wounded at university campuses around the
    country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic authorities announced the
    victory of the Cultural Revolution and the closure of all universities in
    order to Islamicize the curricula. The universities remained closed for
    two years. One of the outcomes of the Cultural Revolution was the purging
    of many university professors and students based on their political
    beliefs. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to the website of Andeesheh va Peykar, the charge
    brought against Ms. Mo tamedi was, propaganda against the Cultural
    Revolution. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Ms. Mo tamedi s defense. Judgment
    The prosecutor of Khuzestan announced in the communiqu that there was an
    accident at the Center for Islamic Guidance. When the Revolutionary Guards
    were transferring female detainees to this Center, one of the Guards
    accidentally shot and killed a girl. According to the Peykar report, Ms.
    Mahnaz Mo tamedi was shot to death by a Revolutionary Guard on April 24,
    1980, at 1:30 a.m. When the Revolutionary Guards were transferring the
    female detainees, who had been arrested duri
