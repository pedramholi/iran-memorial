    The execution of Mr. Esmail Zarafshan and two other convicts was reported
    in the Ettela’at daily (March 11, 1980) The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The report mentioned that the verdict was issued by the fourth
    branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center (Tehran).
    However, no information regarding the circumstances of the trial was
    provided. Charges The report referred to Mr. Zarafshan’s “long past record
    in robbery” and specified that the verdict was issued based on his last
    charge described as “robbery that caused physical harm” as well as “rape.”
    Evidence of guilt This report contained no information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the accused’s defense. Judgment Mr. Zarafshan was sentenced
    to 10 years in prison for robbery and to death for rape. The death
    sentence was carried out in the morning.
