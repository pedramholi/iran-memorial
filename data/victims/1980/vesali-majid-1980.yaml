    The information about Mr. Majid Vesali has been drawn from an interview
    with a relative. This execution was announced in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on August 26, 1980. His name is also mentioned in the list of
    individuals who were executed in relations to the attempted Nojeh coup,
    published by Namir political group. This list contains more than 150
    names. Additional information has been taken from the Public Prosecutor’s
    indictment dated July 19, 1980 (published in the Enqelab Eslami and
    Jomhuri Eslami newspapers a day later). The interviewee said: Mr. Vesali
    was a “good young man… he had become a doctor recently and worked in
    Shahreza [Esfahan province].” He was 30 to 33 years old. His mother-in-law
    and brother-in-law (Ms. Bibi Farokh Nikbakht and Lieutenant Naser Rokni)
    were also executed for links to the attempted Nojeh coup. According to
    available information, the planners of the Nojeh coup were members of the
    armed forces and the Iran Party (social democrat and part of the Iranian
    National Front) who opposed the religious rule and believed in the
    separation of church and state. The core of the coup d’état plan was to
    fly aircrafts from Nojeh base in Hamedan and bomb some military targets as
    well as the residence of Ayatollah Khomeini. Another team was to take over
    the radio-television building in Tehran in order to announce the coup and
    expose the motives to the population. On July 9, 1980, the Islamic
    Republic of Iran authorities announced the discovering and dismantling of
    a civil and military network which had planned the coup d’état to
    overthrow the regime. Two months later, the organization Neghab, in a
    communiqué, claimed responsibility for this attempted ‘uprising.’ The
    Organization attested that ‘the path of Mossadegh is that of the people’
    and today ‘Bakhtiar is its authentic leader… We have risen up to put an
    end to this curse [the Islamic regime] and to entrust the affairs of our
    land to the faithful disciple of Mossadegh – Shapur Bakhtiar’” (Iran: In
    Defense of Human Rights, National Movement of the Iranian Resistance,
    Paris, 1983). Following the discovery of the plan for the coup, more than
    sixty officers and civilians were executed in several cities of Iran in
    less than a month. Most of the officers were still active in the army and
    had not been swept away in the first wave of purges which took place in
    the army after the fall of the monarchy. Executions of individuals
    involved in the Nojeh coup continued in the months and years to come; at
    least 200 persons were executed in relations to the coup. Nureddin
    Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet
    communist party) mentioned the coup d’état in an article dated May 2, 2000
    posted on the Rah-e Tudeh website. Kianuri stressed the fact that the
    military branch of the Tudeh Party, which cooperated with the Islamic
    Republic’s authorities, discovered and “neutralized” the above mentioned
    Organization as well as other groups that planned a coup against the newly
    established regime. Arrest and detention No information is available on
    the circumstances of Mr. Vesali’s arrest and detention other than he was
    arrested about 20 days prior to her execution (interview). Trial Mr.
    Vesali was tried at a Special Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal in Esfahan on
    August 23, 1980, along with three other individuals ( Jomhuri Eslami ).
    Charges The Jomhuri Eslami newspaper reported that Mr. Vesali “was
    directly link to Naser Rokni [his brother-in-law]; he brought the latter
    to his house and forwarded news [to another individual named] Manuchehr
    Karimi; he transported cash and paid individuals and purchased arms; and
    he participated in meetings with persons who lived in safe houses.” In an
    indictment dated July 19, 1980, the Public Prosecutor said the following
    regarding some other participants of this alleged coup d’état plan: “These
    enthusiasts of the Shah’s rotten, filthy, and reactionary regime, these
    supporters of the blood-thirsty American imperialism, had in mind to bring
    ‘American social democracy’ as a gift to the liberated people of Iran.
    They had in mind to re-asses the opinion of our heroic nation about the
    return of the royal system through a referendum […].” The Public
    Prosecutor added: “This conspiracy was not planned in a vacuum and hence
    cannot be described in a single indictment; and these conspirators cannot
    be considered ordinary convicts… Considering that and by consulting the
    holy verses of the Koran regarding the punishment of the ‘rebel’ against
    the Islamic sovereign, it is imperative that the convicts receive their
    punishment according to the Shari’a law.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    newspaper report did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendants. Defense No information is available
    regarding the defense. Mr. Vesali was denied the righ
