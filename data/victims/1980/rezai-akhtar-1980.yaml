circumstances: >
    The execution of Ms. Akhtar Reza'i and another woman was reported by the
    correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Kermanshah (August 4, 1980).
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges Based on the report, Ms. Reza'i was charged
    with establishing a center of prostitution. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report contains no information regarding the evidence presented against
    the defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms. Reza'i s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Eslamabad e Gharb
    found Ms. Reza'i a corruptor on earth and destroyer of a generation. She
    was executed at 3:30 in the morning.
