    born into a Baha i family, in Ferdows, Khorasan, in 1925. After he
    finished his high school education, he went to Tehran and studied Natural
    Sciences at the Teacher Training College. Upon graduation, he returned to
    Ferdows. He was elected to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Ferdows. Due to
    extreme persecution by the local populace, Mr. Rahmani was obliged to move
    from Ferdows to Mashhad. A few years later, he moved to Tehran with his
    family. In 1978 he was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of the
    Baha is of Iran. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran, August 13, 2021)
    Mr. Rahmani was married and he had four children. He would routinely meet
    with government officials and defend the human rights of members of the
    Baha i community, clearing up false allegations in Ghom and Tehran . In
    1978, following the burning and destruction of Baha i homes in Sa diyyeh
    neighborhood of Shiraz, he went to this town and took pictures and slides
    of the destroyed homes and sent a detailed report of the extent of the
    damages to the House of Justice . Ms. Jinus Mahmoudi, one of the executed
    Baha is, has described Mr. Rahmani as a person who understood the
    principles of management. He was always preparing plans, activities, forms
    and charts. He was not a recording secretary, but he kept records of
    events. He recorded all events, so that we would have a written history.
    (Baha i Martyrs Facebook Page , February 27, 2014) The Baha is in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: Background Authorities of the Islamic Republic
    have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran (the
    largest minority, with approximately three hundred thousand members) [1]
    to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence. [2] They have been banned from any activities in the public
    realm, and their political, social, and economic rights are constantly
    violated. Baha is are deprived of the right to education, particularly
    higher education, and are banned from holding jobs in the government or in
    government-affiliated entities. They are not even safe and secure in
    owning private businesses, and in many cases, their places of business
    have either been attacked by individuals and groups affiliated with the
    government or are shut down for refusing to work on religious holy days.
    The Iranian regime arrests Baha is on trumped up charges on a regular
    basis. Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the time of the
    Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified and
    institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah
    Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain instances,
    even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to Iran, in
    response to a question regarding political and religious freedom of Baha
    is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated:
    They are a political party; they are harmfu
