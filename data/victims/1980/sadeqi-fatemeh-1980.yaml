    The Prosecutor General of the Islamic Revolution announced the execution
    of Ms. Fatemeh Sadeqi, along with two other individuals, in a communiqué
    published on May 8, 1980. The daily Enqelab-e Eslami reported the news the
    same day, quoting the Prosecutor's communiqué. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charges against Ms. Sadeqi, as announced in the Prosecutor's communiqué
    were: "luring girls and spreading prostitution". The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the accused defense. Judgment The Revolutionary Tribunal
    declared Ms. Sadeqi a "corruptor on earth." She was executed at dawn.
