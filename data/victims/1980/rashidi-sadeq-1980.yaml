    The execution of Mr. Sadeq Rashidi was announced in a communiqué of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Qom published in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily (June 10, 1980). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Based on the
    communiqué, the defendant was tried along with three others accused of
    participation in an armed robbery from a house in Bagh e Yek of
    Khlajestan. Mr. Rashidi was the only one of the defendants to receive a
    death sentence. Charges The communiqué mentioned Mr. Rashidi’s charges as
    “participation in an unsuccessful armed robbery” and “intentionally
    shooting at the owner of the house, Ali Refahi, resulting in his death.”
    Evidence of guilt The communiqué did not refer to any specific evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Rashidi’s defense. Judgment Mr. Rashidi, sentenced to death, was
    executed at dawn.
