    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
