    The execution of Mr. Ali Alikhah was announced along with four others in a
    report by the correspondent of Pars News Agency, published in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily (June 4, 1980). Arrest and detention No information is
    available on the circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention.
    Trial The circumstances of Mr. Alikhah s trial are not known. Charges
    According to the report, the defendant was accused of production,
    distribution, selling and buying of heroin. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    about the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense The report
    provides no information about the accused s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Hamedan sentenced the five defendants to death.
    Mr. Alikhah and the other four stood before the firing squad at dawn.
