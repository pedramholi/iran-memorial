    organized by the Independent Association of Unemployed Workers on March
    15, 1980 in Rah Ahan Square in Andimeshk. 1980 Andimeshk Protest Less than
    a year after the 1979 revolution, an atmosphere of hope emerged among
    young people seeking justice and social rights. During this period, there
    were numerous protests in cities such as Tehran, Tabriz, Mahabad, Sari,
    Amol, Shiraz, Isfahan, Ilam, Gonbad Kavus, Rasht and Abadan, where
    demonstrators demanded jobs and economic rights. Unemployed youth in
    various regions sought to organize their employment-related issues by
    forming independent associations or unions, free from political
    affiliations. In Tabriz, for example, the " Graduate and Post-Graduate
    Union" was formed, which successfully held meetings with provincial
    authorities and received official recognition from the provincial
    government, allowing it to pursue its goals. Similar organizations in
    other cities, however, faced harsh repression. In one notable incident,
    one person was killed and four others were injured during a crackdown on
    protests by unemployed workers in Isfahan. Unemployed workers'
    associations in Dorud and Andimeshk were also violently repressed. At the
    time, Andimeshk's population had increased due to an influx of migrants
    and wartime displacement, exacerbating social problems in the area. The
    Independent Union of the Unemployed in Andimeshk was founded after the
    1979 revolution with a focus on workers' rights. It aimed to defend the
    right to work and to protest "appointed hiring practices in state
    institutions and the interference of Islamic associations in employment
    decisions. Early on, union representatives negotiated with the mayor, who
    gave them a room in the city hall. This space became their official
    headquarters and helped them organize their efforts more effectively.
    Union members gathered there daily to hold meetings and send letters to
    Andimeshk authorities demanding jobs for the city's unemployed. Despite no
    official response, the union's activities, such as distributing flyers and
    organizing protests, gained strong support from young people. Between
    3,000 and 4,000 unemployed youth joined the union, paying a small
    membership fee. Despite the mayor's initial cooperation with the union,
    this resulted in a series of disagreements between the mayor's office and
    the governor's office. These disagreements ultimately led to the mayor's
    dismissal. According to union members, the government ignored their
    demands, which included giving priority to hiring local workers. In
    response, the union organized a sit-in at the Ministry of Education, where
    members stayed for several days, giving speeches and reading statements
    from various organizations and political groups supporting the unemployed.
    Local residents also supported the protest by bringing food for the
    demonstrators. However, the sit-in was violently dispersed by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and several protesters were arrested.
    Around March 5, 1980, the union organized a sit-in at the Andimeshk
    governor's office, which ended after the governor promised to address
    their demands by contacting authorities in the capital. However, when
    their demands were later rejected and deemed illegal, on March 15, 1980,
    thousands of people gathered in front of the Andimeshk Railway Office and
    prevented officials from leaving. The crowd was dispersed after the
    Revolutionary G
