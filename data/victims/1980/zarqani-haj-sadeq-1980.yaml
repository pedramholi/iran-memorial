circumstances: >
    The execution of Haj Reza Zarqani was reported along with six others by
    the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Sabzevar (August 23,
    1980). Arrest and detention There is no information available on Mr.
    Zarqani s arrest and detention in this report. Trial The report provided
    no information on Mr. Zarqani s trial. Charges Based on the report, the
    defendant was charged with drug trafficking. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report indicated that
    the officials found twenty one kilograms and six hundred grams of opium in
    Mr. Zarqani s possession. Defense No information on the accused s defense
    is available. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sabzevar
    sentenced Mr. Zarqani to death. He was executed at dawn, three days after
    his trial.
