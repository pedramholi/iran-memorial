circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mostafa Kheirollahi and two others was reported by
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily correspondent in Kerman (August 14, 1980). Arrest
    and detention No information is available on the circumstances of Mr.
    Kheirollahi s arrest and detention. Trial No specific information on the
    trial is available in the report. Charges The defendant s charges were as
    follows: repeated counts of robbery, committing anti-Islamic acts,
    possessing drugs and alcoholic beverages, establishing brothels, and
    promoting prostitution . The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentenced to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report did
    not provide any information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information on the accused s defense is available.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman declared Mr.
    Kheirollahi a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death.
