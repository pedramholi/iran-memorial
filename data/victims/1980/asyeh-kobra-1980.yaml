    The execution of Ms. Kobra, also known as Asieh, was reported along with
    three others by the correspondent of Pars New Agency and published in the
    Jomhuri Eslami daily (June 7, 1980). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According the report, this defendant and the other three were drug dealers
    from the village of Hesar Dizaj. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on this
    defendant s defense. Judgment The defendant was sentenced to death.
