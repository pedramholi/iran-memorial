    Officer Mohammad Ali Nazliani s name appeared in a list of 21 executed
    individuals, reported by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals of Tehran and
    Hamedan and published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (June 7, 1980). Arrest
    and detention The report provided no information regarding the
    circumstances of Mr. Salehi s arrest and detention. Trial The Jomhuri
    Eslami report mentioned that Officer Nazliani was tried in Tehran by the
    religious judge who was also the head of the Campaign against Drugs and
    Narcotics. No specific information was provided regarding his trial.
    Charges Based on the report, Officer Nazliani, employee of the Qasr
    Prison, was accused of having made a fortune by acting as a connection
    between the prisoners and the drug cartel outside and smuggling in heroin
    and opium for addicted prisoners. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report did not
    contain any information regarding the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available on Officer Nazliani s
    defense. Judgment Officer Nazliani was found guilty of corruption on earth
    and waging war against God. He was sentenced to confiscation of all his
    belongings in addition to the death sentence. The death sentence was
    carried out within moments after the issuance of the verdict.
