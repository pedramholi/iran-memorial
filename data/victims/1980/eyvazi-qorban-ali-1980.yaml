circumstances: >
    Mr. Qorban Ali Eyvazi was among the eight individuals shot to death by the
    Revolutionary Guards (Pasdaran) of Tabriz. Based on the account given by
    the Revolutionary Guards headquarters of Tabriz to the correspondent of
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily (July 3, 1980), Mr. Eyvazi and seven others
    attempted to escape when they were being driven from the Special Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal for Drugs and Narcotics to their execution site in
    Khoy Prison. Five of the convicts were shot to death on the spot by
    Revolutionary Guards, and the remaining three were shot at the execution
    site. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this individual s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    circumstances of Mr. Eyvazi s trial. Charges Based on the report, Mr.
    Eyvazi was convicted of professional and international drug trafficking.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report contains no information regarding the evidence presented against
    the defendant at the trial. Defense No information is available on the
    defendant s defense. Judgment Mr. Eyvazi was sentenced to death by the
    religious judge at the Special Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal for Drugs
    and Narcotics.
