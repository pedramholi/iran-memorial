    The execution of Mr. Morteza Delavar Motlaq, son of Ali and a resident of
    Tehran, along with 9 other individuals was reported by the correspondent
    of Pars New Agency, quoting the religious judge of the Anti-Narcotic
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals. The Jomhuri Eslami newspaper published
    the report on July 24, 1980. Arrest and detention Based on the report, the
    defendant was arrested by the Tehran Police shortly prior to his
    execution. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Delavar Motlaq was accused of having drawn poor youth, from
    the south-east of Tehran and Khavaran Street, to drugs and prostitution.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt Based
    on the report, the defendant was caught in possession of 680 grams of
    heroin. Defense No information is available on the defense. Judgment The
    religious judge of the Anti-Narcotic Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    sentenced Mr. Morteza Delavar Motlaq to death. He was executed early in
    the morning on Wednesday July 23, 1980.
