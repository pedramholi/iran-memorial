circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Nazari and three others was announced in a
    report by the correspondent of Pars News Agency in Tabriz, published in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily (November 10, 1980). Arrest and detention The
    report provided no information on the circumstances of Mr. Nazari s arrest
    and detention. Trial No information about Mr. Nazari s trial was provided
    in the report. Charges According to the report, Mr. Nazari was charged
    with murdering of a person called Mohammad Panahzadeh. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There
    is no information available on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense The report provided no information about the defendant
    s defense. Judgment Mr. Nazari was sentenced to death.
