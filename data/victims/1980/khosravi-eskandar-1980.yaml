    The execution of Mr. Eskandar Khosravi was reported by the correspondent
    of Pars News Agency in Ahvaz. The report was published in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily (July 26, 1980) Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are unknown. Trial The Court held a
    session at 3:30 p.m. to examine Mr. Khosravi s case. Based on this
    information, the trial could not have lasted more than an hour. Charges
    According to the report, Mr. Khosravi was charged with armed robbery
    during both the Shah s and the current regime and large scale distribution
    of heroin while in prison. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report does
    not contain any information about the evidence presented against the
    victim. Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor found Mr. Khosravi
    guilty of corruption on earth and waging war against God and his prophet.
    He was executed immediately after his trial in the afternoon.
