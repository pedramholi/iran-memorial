place_of_death: "Zahedan"
province: "Sistan Va Baluchestan"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Isa Zahir and two other convicts was
    announced in a communiqu by the Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of
    Sistan and Baluchestan published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (June 7,
    1980). Arrest and detention No information is available on the
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention. Trial The
    communiqu provides no information regarding Mr. Zahir s trial. Charges Mr.
    Zahir, referred to by the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily as a
    bale burner, was accused of the following: participation in torching
    bales, resisting the gendarmerie officials and Revolutionary Guards, and
    shooting at the Revolutionary Guards, resulting in the martyrdom of
    Mohammad Jahangir. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    about the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense The report
    provides no information about the accused s defense. Judgment Mr. Zahir
    was sentenced to death.
