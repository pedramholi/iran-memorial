circumstances: >
    The execution of Ms. Esmat Maleki was reported by the correspondent of the
    Jomhuri Eslami daily in Esfahan (August 4, 1980). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the circumstances of the defendant s
    trial. Charges According to the report, Ms. Maleki, a resident of the
    Sheikhabad village, was charged with years of selling her body and
    deluding innocent girls. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report
    contains no information regarding the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms. Maleki s defense.
    Judgment the Religious Court of Zarrinshahr found Ms. Maleki a corruptor,
    and she was executed.
