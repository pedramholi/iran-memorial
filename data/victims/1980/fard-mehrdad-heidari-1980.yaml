    Mehrdad Heidari Fard was only 15 years old. He was a very kind, studious,
    disciplined, and polite adolescent. Information regarding the
    extrajudicial killing of Mr. Mehrdad Heidarifard, son of Ehteram Kasraiyan
    and Ahmad, was obtained from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center with Mr. Heidarifard s uncle, [his mother s brother]
    (January 10, 2022), his friends and acquaintances messages, and an
    electronic form submitted to the Boroumand Center (March 4, 2010). News of
    this extrajudicial killing was also published on Janhaye Shifteh website
    (January 5, 2015); in the In Memoriam section in the book Shahidane Ma Dar
    Rahe Azadi, Dar Rahe Socialism ( Our Martyrs, Perished for the Cause of
    Freedom, for the Cause of Socialism ), a Rahe Kargar Organization
    publication; and in the Kar Publication, Number 104, the Fadaiyan
    Guerrilla Organization (Majority) of Iran s publication (April 8, 1981).
    Additional information about this killing was obtained from the Lor
    Liberation Movement s website (January 9, 2014); Shabestan News Aganecy
    (June 28, 2016); and Navide Shahed website (September 2, 2021). According
    to available information, Mr. Heidarifard was 15 years old, born in the
    city of Khorramabad, single, and hailed from one of Khorramabad s families
    known in the realms of art and politics. We had a large family, and we
    played a role in all artistic and political realms because of our position
    in the city. Every member of our family, which numbered 10 to 15, was
    either involved in artistic or political work. (Boroumand Center interview
    with Mr. Heidarifard s uncle). Qodrat and Nasrollah Kasraiyan, two of Iran
    s most famous photographers, are Mr. Heidarifard s uncles, [his mother s
    brothers]. Mr. Heidarifard was a student and had finished eighth grade at
    Shahram Hafezi Middle School. He liked poetry and wrote poems himself. He
    was a good calligrapher as well. He was really talented. His handwriting
    [and calligraphy] was really beautiful and he also wrote poetry.
    (Boroumand Center interview with Mr. Heidarifard s uncle). Mr. Heidarifard
    was also a member of the Pishgam Organization of the Fadaiyan Guerilla
    Organization. His political activities at this Organization consisted of
    hand-writing pamphlets, distributing pamphlets, writing slogans, and
    organizing book and photography expositions. He also participated in
    school protests. According to one of his classmates, Mehrdad was a very
    kind, studious, disciplined, and polite adolescent. He liked drawing and
    was good at it . He continued: One of his more prominent character traits
    was his calmness and his dislike of violence. In essence, our friendship
    started with a fight. As young kids, I hit him in the face with a pencil,
    but he didn t respond to me with violence. That fight led to our
    friendship. (Mr. Heidarifard s friend and classmate). The Fadayian Khalq
    Guerrilla Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban
    Revolution and the urban guerrilla movements of Latin America, was founded
    in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following
    the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle,
    split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union
    In 1980-81, a group of the city s Hezbollahis, led by Hojjatoleslam
    Fakhreddin Rahimi*, who had turned the city of Khorramabad s Alavi Mosque
    into an Islamic Revolution Committee station, attacked the Kasraiyan
    family s art gallery and set it on fire. Believe me, they attacked and
    pillaged like the Mongols [attacked Iran in the 13thCentury]: Anybody who
    could get their hands on anything, a chair, a cooling unit, etc., would
    take it and leave. And this was just a prelude [to what was to come].
    (Boroumand Center interview with Mr. Heidarifard s uncle). A report of the
    attack on Mr. Kasraiyan s art gallery states in part: We will not forget
    and we will not forgive the time where the talented Kasraiyan Brothers art
    gallery in Khorramabad and the expensive paintings there were set on fire
    in a savage attack by the Hezbollahis dispatched from Khorramabad s Alavi
    Mosque, led by the defunct mullah Rahimi. The aforementioned group was
    known among the townspeople as the Black Gangs . The Fadaiyan Organization
    (Majority) wrote this regarding these gangs: The toiling people of the
    Lorestan [region s] towns have witnessed [the Black Gangs ]
    counter-revolutionary operations over and over again. Not a day goes by
    where supporters of progressive and anti-imperialist organizations are not
    beaten, pursued, or kidnapped in public by hoodlums affiliated with Black
    Gangs. This has become part of these criminals daily routine, which they
    unabashedly call their actions in the defense of the Islamic Republic ,
    revolutionary , in defense of Islam , etc. It continued: Currently, the
    Black Gangs in Lorestan Province have become a serious danger and an
    important tool in the hands of counter-revolutionaries. Every minute of
    every day, most cities and towns in Lorest
