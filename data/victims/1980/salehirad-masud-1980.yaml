    Mr. Mas ud Salehirad is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on
    the list, Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class published on the website Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    1979 Revolution. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have been
    executed. The information about him has been taken from the Peykar
    magazine, No. 96 (August 25, 1980). According to the available
    information, Mr. Salehirad, from Rasht, was a fourth year medical student
    at Tabriz University and a member of the University and High School
    Students Section of the Peykar Organization. The Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. The Peykar Organization was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state, believed that China
    had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed
    all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    At 5 a.m. on August 4, 1980, Mr. Salehirad and a friend, Mr. Tayeb
    Najmoddini, were distributing leaflets of the Peykar Organization when
    they were arrested either by agents of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, or
    by one of its subsidiary committees. Trial According to information
    available, Mr. Salehirad was not summoned to a court or tried before his
    arrest. Charges The charge brought against the defendant is not known.
    Evidence of guilt At the time of his arrest, Mr. Salehirad was
    distributing Peykar leaflets. Defense No information is available about
    Mr. Salehirad s defense. Judgment Two hours after Mr. Salehirad s arrest,
    a shepherd found the bodies of two young men. Next to the bodies, he could
    see the tire marks of a van or a Jeep the same type of vehicle that the
    Revolutionary Guards used. Three days later, the bodies were buried at the
    Vadi Rahmat cemetery in Tabriz as unidentified individuals. On August 15,
    affiliates of the Peykar Organization discovered what had happened. On
    August 18, 1980, a memorial service was held at the cemetery. Family
    members of the two young men were at the memorial service, including Mr.
    Salehirad s brother. Mr. Salehirad s friends in Rasht organized a
    demonstration and memorial service for him. According to information
    available, Revolutionary Guards and Hezbillahi (Party of God) agents
    attempted to interrupt the ceremony but failed. The date of this event is
    not known.
