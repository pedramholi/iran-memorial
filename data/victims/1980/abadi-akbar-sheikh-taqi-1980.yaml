circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Akbar Sheikh Taqi Abadi and another individual was
    reported in the Ettela at daily (January 6, 1980). Arrest and detention No
    information is available on the circumstances of Mr. Sheikh Taqi Abadi s
    arrest and detention. Trial The report did not provide any information
    regarding Mr. Sheikh Taqi Abadi s trial. Charges Mr. Sheikh Taqi Abadi s
    charges, as reported by Ettelaat, were as follows: distributing heroin,
    hiding 100 grams of heroin, forcing women to prostitution through physical
    and mental threats and tortures, having illegitimate relationships with
    women, and adultery. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no
    information about the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense
    The report does not mention the accused s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman declared Mr. Sheikh Taqi Abadi a
    corruptor on earth . He was executed in the morning after his trial.
