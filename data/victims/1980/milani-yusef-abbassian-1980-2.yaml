    1980); BBC Persian website (October 11, 2015); Asoo website (August 9,
    September 6, and October 6, 2015). Doctor Yusef Abbassian Milani was born
    in 1927-28, into a Baha i family in Eshghabad (Tabas) County in South
    Khorasan Province. (Archives of Baha I Persecution, September 15, 2021).
    He finished elementary school in Tabriz. He subsequently went to Khorasan
    Province when his father was transferred there due to his job, and from
    there to Tehran, where he enrolled in Dar-ol-Fonoon School. In the years
    he lived in Tehran, and as he was studying, he became a member of local
    and national Lajneh. He finished dental school at the Tehran University
    Faculty of Dentistry, with a concentration in maxillofacial surgery. Mr.
    Milani initially decided not to use an American scholarship to continue
    his education there, given a travel prohibition for Baha is, and went to
    Kermanshah to perform his mandatory military service instead. After the
    prohibition was lifted in 1959, however, he went to the United States to
    obtain a specialty. Upon his return from the United States, Mr. Milani
    opened a medical practice in Tehran. He was elected council member of the
    Baha i Faith s Deputyship for Organizational Affairs. He actively
    participated in Baha i-related affairs during that period and played a
    role in establishing Baha i National Spiritual Councils in several
    countries, including Afghanistan. (Golestan-e Eshgh Facebook Page,
    September 23, 2018). The Deputyship Council in the Baha i Faith s
    organizational structure where Mr. Abbassian Milani was a member, includes
    individuals who are appointed upon a decision by the Continental Advisory
    Board for a five-year term, and engage in promoting and strengthening Baha
    I communities in the territories where they are active, which usually
    include smaller regions in a specific country. The deputies have an
    advisory role in relation with local Spiritual Councils . (Archives of
    Baha I Persecution, September 15, 2021). After the 1979 Revolution, Mr.
    Abbassain Milani did not heed the advice of his friends and acquaintances
    to leave Iran. He actively participated in the Baha I communities
    administrative institutions inside Iran. (Golestan-e Eshgh Facebook Page,
    September 23, 2018). The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    Background Authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members
    of the Baha'i religious community of Iran (the largest minority, with
    approximately three hundred thousand members) [1] to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence. [2] They have been
    banned from any activities in the public realm, and their political,
    social, and economic rights are constantly violated. Baha is are deprived
    of the right to education, particularly higher education, and are banned
    from holding jobs in the government or in government-affiliated entities.
    They are not even safe and secure in owning private businesses, and in
    many cases, their places of business have either been attacked by
    individuals and groups affiliated with the government or are shut down for
    refusing to work on religious holy days. The Iranian regime arrests Baha
    is on trumped up charges on a regular basis. Persecution of Baha is in
    Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in
    this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i h
