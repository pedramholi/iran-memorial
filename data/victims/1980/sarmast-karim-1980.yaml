    The execution of Mr. Karim Sarmast and three others was reported by the

    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges The report mentioned that Mr. Sarmast was
    charged with being a repeat offender in distributing and selling drugs.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available regarding the evidence of
    guilt provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Sarmast s defense. Judgment The Special Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal for Combating Drugs and Narcotics sentenced Mr. Sarmast to death.
