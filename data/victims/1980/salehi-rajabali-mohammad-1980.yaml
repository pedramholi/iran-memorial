circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Rajabali Mohammad Salehi was reported along with
    three others in the Ettela at daily (February 7, 1980). According to the
    report, a fifth individual, Brigadier General Jamsheed Fathi Moqadam,
    former Commander of Artillery of the Infantry Division of the Guard, asked
    to perform a ceremonial washing right before the sentence was carried out.
    When, concerned about his long absence, the Revolutionary Guards went to
    the prison bathroom, they found that he had committed suicide by cutting
    his wrist with a sharp object. He was reported to have bled to death. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial According to the report, Mr. Mohammad
    Salehi was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center
    (Tehran) along with four others, three of whom were convicted of having
    served the SAVAK (former regime political police). No specific information
    about the circumstances of the trial is provided in the report. Charges
    The report indicated the defendant's charge to be rape. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense The report provided no information about the accused s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center
    (Tehran) sentenced Mr. Mohammad Salehi to death. He was executed in the
    Evin prison at dawn.
