    The execution of Mr. Abdolrasul Voldan and 15 others was reported by the
    correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami and Kayhan dailies in Shiraz (July 5,
    1980). Arrest and detention The circumstances of this individual s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial Based on the Jomhuri Eslami report, the
    religious judge traveled to Shiraz and, after visiting the Revolutionary
    Guard (Pasdaran) headquarters of Shiraz, headed for the Shiraz Tribunal,
    where he examined the cases of sixteen individuals charged with a range of
    crimes from killing and suppression of revolutionary combatants to drug
    dealing and sodomy. Mr. Voldan was one of the defendants. Charges While
    Jomhuri Eslami solely referred to Mr. Voldan as a drug dealer, Kayhan
    mentioned his charges as buying and selling heroin and opium. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    reports contain no information regarding the evidence presented against
    the defendant at the trial. Defense No information is available on the
    defendant s defense. Judgment The defendant who, based on the Kayhan
    report, was sentenced to life imprisonment in the previous regime, was
    sentenced to death by the religious judge at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Shiraz. The Jomhuri Eslami report specifies that the sentence
    included confiscation of property for six of the accused. It is not clear
    whether or not Mr. Voldan s properties were confiscated.
