    The execution of Mr. Amir Khani was reported along with three others in
    the Ettela at daily (February 7, 1980). Based on this report, a fifth
    individual, Brigadier General Jamsheed Fathi Moqadam, former Commander of
    Artillery of the Infantry Division of the Guard, asked to perform a
    ceremonial washing right before the sentence was carried out. When,
    concerned about his long absence, the Revolutionary Guards went to the
    prison bathroom, they found that he had committed suicide by cutting his
    wrist with a sharp object. He was reported to have bled to death. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial According to the report, Mr. Khani was tried at the

    other defendants, two of them convicted of adultery and rape. No specific

    report. Charges The Revolutionary Tribunal explained the defendant s
    charges to the correspondent of the Ettela at daily as follows: He was
    appointed by the police to serve SAVAK [former regime political police].
    in 1355 [1976] and since then, he has diligently suppressed the
    revolutionaries. Evidence of guilt In his report to the correspondent of
    the Ettela at daily, the Revolutionary Tribunal referred to a letter from
    the Joint Anti-Terrorist Committee to the police, dated 1355/4/15
    [06/05/1976], requesting medals for 13 individuals who participated in the
    massacre of 41 Mojahedin and combatants during partisan operations,
    exhibited bravery in these clashes, and had highly satisfying performances
    in general. Allegedly, the defendant s name was mentioned as the twelfth
    person on the list to be rewarded a medal for his services to the SAVAK.

    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center (Tehran) sentenced Mr. Khani
