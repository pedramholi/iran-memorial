    Mr. Bahman Rashidi s name appeared in a list of 21 executed individuals,
    reported by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals of Tehran and Hamedan and
    published Jomhuri Eslami daily (June 7, 1980). Arrest and detention The
    report provided no information regarding the circumstances of Mr. Rashidi
    s arrest and detention. Trial The Jomhuri Eslami report mentioned that Mr.
    Rashidi was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Hamedan,
    presided by the religious judge. No specific information was provided
    regarding his trial. Charges Based on the report, Mr. Rashidi was
    previously sentenced to Hadd [a category of penalties for certain offenses
    in the Islamic law, here referring to flogging] by the Special Court and,
    having served his sentence, was released from prison. However, upon
    release, he revisited the village of Jarqan, purchased heroin, and was
    arrested for possession. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report mentioned that Mr.
    Rashidi was arrested with some drugs on him, but the nature and amount of
    the drugs were not specified. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Rashidi s defense. Judgment Mr. Rashidi was sentenced to death and
    confiscation of all his belongings. The death sentence was carried out
    within moments after the issuance of the verdict.
