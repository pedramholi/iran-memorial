    the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the
    summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various
    leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in
    political action. They introduced themselves as Marxist-Leninists,
    promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat.
    They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they
    opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest
