circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Abdolmarzuqi and two others was reported by the
    correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Khoramabad (August 4, 1980).
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial There is no information available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges Based on the report, Mr. Abdolmarzuqi was
    charged with having a long history in distributing drugs as well as in
    sodomy. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report contains no
    information regarding the evidence of guilt presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Abdolmarzuqi s
    defense. Judgment The Special Tribunal for Drugs and Narcotics sentenced
    Mr. Abdolmarzuqi to death. He was executed on July 31, 1980 at dawn.
