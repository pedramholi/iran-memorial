    The execution of Brigadier General Farrokhzad Jahangiri, son of Khalil,
    was reported along with 4 others in the Jomhuri Eslami and Enqelab Eslami
    dailies (July 20, 1980). Brig. Gen. Jahangiri was reportedly involved in
    planning a coup d etat, known as Noje, which was never carried out.
    Further information regarding this execution was sent to Omid via an
    electronic form by a person familiar with the case. Brig. Gen. Jahangiri,
    a father of one, had studied at the Air Force Academy and was an F-14
    pilot. He was also a member of the Neghab Organization. On July 7, 1980,
    the Islamic Republic of Iran authorities announced the discovery and
    dismantling of a civil and military network which had planned a coup d
    etat to overthrow the regime. Following this discovery, more than sixty
    officers and civilians were executed in several cities of Iran in less
    than a month. Most of the officers were still active in the army and had
    not been purged in the first wave of purges which took place within the
    file and ranks of the army after the fall of the monarchy. Two months
    later, the organization NEGHAB , in a communiqu , claimed responsibility
    for this attempted uprising. The organization attested that the path of
    Mossadegh is that of the people and today Bakhtiar is its authentic
    leader. We have risen up to put an end to this curse (the Islamic regime)
    and to entrust the affairs of our land to the faithful disciple of
    Mossadegh Shapour Bakhtiar. (Iran: In Defense of Human Rights, National
    Movement of the Iranian Resistance, Paris, 1983) Nureddin Kianuri,
    Secretary General of the Tudeh Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet communist
    party) mentions the coup d etat in an article dated May 2, 2000
    (www.rahetudeh.com). Kianuri stresses the fact that the military branch of
    the Tudeh , which cooperated with the Islamic Republic's authorities,
    discovered and "neutralized" the abovementioned organization as well as
    other groups that planned a coup against the newly established regime.
    Arrest and detention No information is available on the circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention. Trial Based on the report, the
    trial was held from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of the Army in the Evin Prison. The deliberation amongst
    religious judges lasted an hour. Charges No charges were specified for
    Brig. Gen. Jahangiri individually. Collectively, he and three other
    defendants were charged with plotting and participation in a coup d etat
    to be carried out on Thursday night, 07/09/1980, against the Islamic
    Republic of Iran and being rebels against the sovereignty of Islam. The
    prosecutor referred to the defendants as enthusiasts of the Shah s rotten,
    filthy, and reactionary regime and supporters of the blood-thirsty
    American imperialism. He further explained that the defendants had in mind
    to bring the American social democracy as a gift to the liberated people
    of Iran. They had in mind to re-assess the opinion of our heroic nation
    about the return of the royal system through a referendum [ ]. Evidence of
    guilt Based on the indictment, the evidences used against the defendants
    were as follows: The defendants clear confessions regarding: 1) having
    designed and having had the intension of carrying out a coup d etat
    against the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 2) having
    prepared 35-50 aircrafts for their operation and for bombing various busy
    parts of the cities, 3) having intended to return the treacherous Bakhtiar
    to power in case their plan succeeded, 4) having prepared printed leaflets
    to distribute among people and threaten to suppress any resistance in case
    their plan succeeded, 5) having planned to take over military centers, the
    Mehrabad Airport, and the Radio and Television Office Reports attached to
    the defendants files by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Statements of
    each defendant about the other defendants Existence of certain indications
    and references in their files Defense No information is available on Brig.
    Gen. Jahangiri s defense. Judgment The indictment ends with the following
    necessary explanation : This conspiracy is not a single incident and these
    conspirators cannot be considered ordinary convicts. These are criminals
    who have undermined the newly found truth, honor, and dignity of a
    liberated Umma [community of Muslim people]. Considering that and by
    consulting the holly verses of the Koran regarding the punishment of the
    rebel against the Islamic sovereign, it is imperative that the convicts
    receive their punishment according to the Shari'a law. Brig. Gen.
    Jahangiri was sentenced to death. At midnight, within hours after the
    issuance of the verdict, the defendant was executed at the same place
    where he was tried.
