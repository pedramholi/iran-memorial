    The execution of Mr. Ali Reza Shokri Afshar and five others was reported

    detention No information is available on the circumstances of Mr. Shokri
    Afshar s arrest and detention. Trial No specific information about the
    trial was provided. Charges Based on the report, the defendant was charged
    with acting against the Islamic Republic government, shooting at innocent
    people and the revolutionary guards, spreading corruption and distributing
    opium, murder and plunder of people, kidnapping, armed robbery, martyring
    several revolutionary guards and army officers, and so forth. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report does not provide any information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information on
    the accused s defense is available. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tabriz declared Mr. Shokri Afshar a corruptor on earth and
    sentenced him to death. The sentence was carried out at dawn.
