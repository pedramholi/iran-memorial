    Mr. Akbar Moradi s name appeared in a list of 21 executed individuals,
    reported by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals of Tehran and Hamedan and
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (June 7, 1980). Arrest and detention
    The report provided no information regarding the circumstances of Mr.
    Moradi s arrest and detention. Trial The Jomhuri Eslami report mentioned
    that Mr. Moradi was tried in Tehran by the religious judge who was also
    the head of the Campaign against Drugs and Narcotics. No specific
    information was provided regarding his trial. Charges Based on the report,
    Mr. Moradi was charged with establishing an opium den and a place where
    sodomy frequently took place, also providing the means of selling and
    buying heroin, opium, and alcoholic drinks, using seven innocent children
    to distribute drugs, and repeated criminal and drug-related records. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report did not contain any information regarding the evidence presented
    against the accused. Defense No information is available on Mr. Moradi s
    defense. Judgment Mr. Moradi was found guilty of corruption on earth and
    waging war against God. The death sentence was carried out within moments
    after the issuance of the verdict.
