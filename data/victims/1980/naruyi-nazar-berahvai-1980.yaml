    The execution of Mr. Nazar Berahvai (Naruyi) and three other individuals
    was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (July 29, 1980). Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial,
    except that it was held the day of the execution. Charges Based on the
    report, Mr. Berahvai was charged with carrying and selling opium. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Berahvai s defense. Judgment According to the report, the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sistan and Baluchestan found Mr.
    Berahvai guilty of corruption on earth. He was sentenced to death and
    executed.
