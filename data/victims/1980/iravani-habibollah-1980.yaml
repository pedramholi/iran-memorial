    The information regarding Mr. Habibollah Irvani has been drawn from an
    electronic form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. Mr.
    Irvani was born in Tehran in 1914 and worked as an entertainer for
    weddings and parties, acting in ruhozi plays. He was married with
    children. The sender of the form remembers Mr. Irvani as gentle, simple,
    and sincere. Ruhozi ( over-the-pool ) theatre has roots in Iranian urban
    culture. It was generally performed at celebrations and weddings. The
    actors put wooden planks over the pool in the yard so that the audience
    can better see the stage. One of the characteristics of this genre of
    theatre is improvised lyrics about social issues, at times critical of
    social problems, accompanied by rhythmic music and dance. Today this genre
    of music is on the verge of extinction. Arrest and detention The exact
    circumstances of Mr. Irvani s arrest and detention are not known. He was
    arrested in his house on Molavi Street in Tehran and detained in Qasr
    prison. Trial There is no information regarding this trial, other than the
    accused was tried by Ayatollah Khalkhali. Charges Mr. Irvani was charged
    with international drug trafficking . The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the
    electronic form, there was no evidence to prove the alleged charge.
    Defense No information is available concerning Mr. Irvani s defense. The
    sender of the electronic form states that Mr. Khalkhali did not understand
    the word defense. This individuals asserts the reasoning behind the
    sentence was that such minstrels would spread debauchery and corruption
    and should be eradicated. The sender of the form goes on to say that Mr.
    Irvani was falsely charged with international drug trafficking even though
    he would sometimes get lost traveling through Tehran. The sender of the
    form emphasizes that Mr. Irvani was not wealthy and lived in a rented
    shanty , and was condemned to death solely for his profession. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the verdict leading to this
    execution. According to the form, one day very early in the morning, Mr.
    Irvani felt very cold in prison and asked for a blanket. The prison guard
    left and returned a few minutes later and said that the judge wanted Mr.
    Irvani to go and fetch a blanket. Mr. Irvani followed the guard into the
    prison yard. The religion judge was waiting outside and told the jailer to
    bring a rope to warm up the prisoner. Mr. Iravni was hanged in Qasr prison
    in 1980.
