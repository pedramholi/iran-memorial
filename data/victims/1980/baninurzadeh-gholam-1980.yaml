    The execution of Mr. Gholam Baninurzadeh and another person was reported
    by the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Mashhad (August 4,
    1980). Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No specific information about the
    circumstances of the trial was provided. Charges Based on the report, Mr.
    Baninurzadeh was charged with carrying 30 kilograms of heroin and a
    sidearm as well as collaboration with drug dealers. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report contains no information regarding the evidence presented against
    the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Baninurzadeh s
    defense. Judgment The Special Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal for Combating
    Drugs and Narcotics in the East of the Country sentenced Mr. Baninurzadeh
    to death. He was executed at dawn.
