    The execution of Mr. Enayat Karimpur and two other individuals was

    in a conversation with the correspondent of Pars News Agency. The Jomhuri
    Eslami daily published the announcement (July 30, 1980). Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Based on the report, Mr. Karimpur was charged with armed robbery ,
    several cases of robbery with harassment , and stealing and hiding opium.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against these defendants
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Karimpur s defense. Judgment The
