    Mr. Alavi Shushtari dove into projects of assistance and support in
    Khuzestan and his native city of Ahvaz. There, at Jondi Shapur University,
    he joined students resisting Khomeini s Cultural Revolution. Information
    regarding Mr. Mehdi Alavi Shushtari was obtained from an interview with
    his mother and an electronic form regarding his case sent to Omid by an
    individual close to him. In addition, the execution of Mr. Alavi Shushtari
    was announced in Jomhuri Eslami and Enghelab Eslami newspapers on June 29,
    1980 , and also in Peykar , the publication of the Peykar Organization
    (No. 61, June 30, 1980; addendum to No. 83, December 1, 1980 and No. 111,
    June 22, 1981). He is also one of 451 individuals whose name appears on
    the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class published on the website of Peykar. The Columbus Ledger also
    published an article about his execution on July 3, 1980. Mr. Alavi
    Shushtari was born in Ahvaz in 1953. He was arrested in 1974 due to his
    affiliation with a student group, and he was sentenced to three years in
    prison. After his release, he went to the United States to continue his
    education. Being dissatisfied with the direction of the Islamic Revolution
    of 1979, he returned to Iran. He then enrolled in Ahvaz University,
    majoring in mathematics. In 1979, he became a member of an organization of
    students who were sympathizers of the Peykar Organization. Those close to
    Mr. Alavi Shushtari describe him as a very generous and giving person.
    When some areas of Khuzestan Province were affected by floods he rushed to
    assist the people in the region. He founded a library in Zeytun Kargari, a
    working class neighborhood in Ahvaz. Mr. Alavi Shushtari excelled in his
    studies at all levels. One of his college instructors in the United States
    referred to him as the most brilliant student he has ever had. He enjoyed
    cycling and reading. His favorite food was sabzipolo , which he called
    polosabz (green rice) since his childhood. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a social-imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. The Cultural
    Revolution began after Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech in March 1980 and
    ordered that universities be purged of all those who opposed his regime
    and be transformed into learning environments [as opposed to political
    forums] where an all-Islamic curriculum is taught. The first wave of
    violence began on April 15, 1980 during a speech by Akbar Hashemi
    Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister
    of Interior] at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech, students
    supporting the regime took control of the University s central building
    and demanded that the university be purged from pro-Shah elements and
    other sellouts. * Arrest and detention Mr. Alavi Shushtari he was arrested
    during unrest in Jondi Shapur University in Ahvaz on April 22, 1979
    (Boroumand Foundation interview with his mother, August 9, 2012,, Peykar
    magazine December 1, 1980). On that day the state-run radio asked people
    to enter the university and throw out the students resisting the Cultural
    Revolution. The Friday Prayer leader had also asked the people to join him
    in a mass prayer to be held on university grounds on that day. According
    to Mr. Alavi Shushtari s mother, the authorities searched their residence
    one day after his arrest, and they took his books and documents. The
    authorities refused to give any information on Mr. Alavi Shushtari s
    status to his family for a month and a half after his arrest. Mr. Alavi
    Shushtari had two visits with his family after his arrest. The first visit
    was a month and a half after he was arrested. During this visit Mr. Alavi
    Shushtari s mother noticed stitches on his forehead, indicating that it
    was broken. Revolutionary Guards and prison officials were disruptive
    during this visit, and they did not allow Mr. Alavi Shushtari to talk to
    his family freely. The second and last visit was on June 25, 1980, a day
    before his execution. On that day he told his parents that that he had
    experienced different methods of torture from what was used before the
    Revolution. For example, he mentioned simulated executions as a method of
    torture. Trial The exact dat
