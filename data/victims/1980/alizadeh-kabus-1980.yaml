    The execution of Major Kabus Alizadeh and 12 others convicted of
    participation in an unrealized coup d’etat plan known as Noje was declared
    in a communiqué of the Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Public Prosecutor’s central office. The communiqué was published in the
    Jomhuri Eslami daily (August 7, 1980). In his 07/19/1980 indictment
    (published in the Enqelab Eslami and Jomhuri Eslami dailies, July 20,
    1980), the public prosecutor provided the following “necessary
    explanation” about some other participants of this coup d’etat that was
    never put to practice: “This conspiracy is not a single incident and these
    conspirators cannot be considered ordinary convicts. These are criminals
    who have undermined the newly-found truth, honor, and dignity of a
    liberated umma [community of Muslim people]. Considering that and by
    consulting the holly verses of the Koran regarding the punishment of the
    ‘rebel’ against the Islamic sovereign, it is imperative that the convicts
    receive their punishment according to the Shari’a law.” Arrest and
    detention No information is available on the circumstances of Major
    Alizadeh’s arrest and detention. Trial According to this communiqué, the
    First Branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center held
    sessions from 08/04/1980 to 08/06/1980 to examine the cases of these
    thirtheen defendants. Charges No individual charges were specified for
    Major Alizadeh. Collectively, the defendants were charged with “rebellion
    against the just Imam and the Islamic Republic of Iran” and “enjoying
    assistance from such powerful supporters as America and Israel.” The
    public prosecutor’s 07/19/1980 indictment reads as follows regarding some
    other participants of this coup d’etat plan: “These enthusiasts of the
    Shah’s rotten, filthy, and reactionary regime, these supporters of the
    blood-thirsty American imperialism, had in mind to bring ‘American social
    democracy’ as a gift to the liberated people of Iran. They had in mind to
    re-asses the opinion of our heroic nation about the return of the royal
    system through a referendum […].” Evidence of guilt The communiqué did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against the
    defendants. Defense The communiqué indicated that the accused’s defense
    was heard, but provided no further specific information. Judgment The
    First Branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center declared
    Major Alizadeh a “corruptor on earth” and an “enemy of God and his
    prophet” and sentenced him to death. He was executed at 1 a.m., within
    hours since his trial.
