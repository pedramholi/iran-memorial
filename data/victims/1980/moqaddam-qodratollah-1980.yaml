circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Qodratollah Moqaddam and three others was reported by
    the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Kermanshah (July 31,
    1980). The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges The report mentioned that Mr. Moqaddam was
    charged with being a repeat offender in distributing and selling drugs.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available regarding the evidence of
    guilt provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Moqaddam s defense. Judgment The Special Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal for Combating Drugs and Narcotics sentenced Mr. Moqaddam to
    death. He was executed at 11 a.m.
