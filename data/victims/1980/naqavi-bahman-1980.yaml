circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Bahman Naqavi, a civil servant for the Ministry of
    Education in Meshgin Shahr, was reported in the Ettela'at daily (February
    16, 1980). International human rights organizations have drawn attention
    to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against these defendants
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Naqavi s trial. Charges Mr. Naqavi was charged with pedophilia involving a
    seven-year-old boy. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Naqavi's defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Meshgin Shahr sentenced Mr.
    Naqavi to death. The sentence was carried out at 3 in the morning.
