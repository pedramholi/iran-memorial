    He was simply a prosperous jewish businessman. News of the execution of
    Mr. Ebrahim Berukhim, son of Ess haq, was submitted through electronic
    form to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center on August 26, 2019, by a person
    close to him. (Electronic form). News of this execution and that of 14
    other individuals had also been published in Kayhan and Jomhuri-e Eslami
    newspapers on July 31, 1980, quoting the State Prosecutor General s Public
    Relations Office. Additional information about this case was obtained from
    Kayhan newspaper (May 4, 1980), Jomhuri-e Eslami newspaper (May 5, 1980),
    Shahyad Publication website in Israel, and in articles written by Mr.
    Karmel Melamed about Mr. Berukhim (March 4, 2004, and July 23, 2010). Mr.
    Berukhim was a single and wealthy Jewish businessman. He had completed his
    college education at the University of Denver in the United States, and
    had returned to Iran in the mid 1970 s. After serving his mandatory
    military service, he became a partner in Tehran s Imperial hotel.
    According to his relatives, Mr. Berukhim was a successful man without any
    political affiliations. He had an older sister whom he was very close to.
    In the early days of the Revolution, Mr. Berukhim was arrested at his
    hotel by the Islamic regime s armed agents. The agents blindfolded and
    took him to Tehran s Qasr Prison, and took over his hotel. Mr. Berukhim
    was in jail for two months. His family was able to obtain his release
    through bribing prison officials. His family was trying to take the hotel
    back. Therefore, every week, one of them would go to Evin Prison to answer
    questions, because the authorities had told them they would give them
    their hotel back if they answered their questions. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Berukhim was arrested for the second time in May 1980 along with his
    82-year-old father. He had gone to Evin Prison with his father to discuss
    the return of their hotel, which the officials had promised them they
    would do, but they were both arrested instead. There is no further
    information about Mr. Berukhim s arrest. According to one of his friends,
    he appeared to have been tortured in prison because of the signs and marks
    on the bottom of his feet. Trial Markaz (Central) Islamic Revolutionary
    Court, Branch One, tried Mr. Berukhim and three other members of his
    family on May 4, 1980; they were represented by counsel. No information is
    available about the trial session(s). Charges The charges brought against
    Mr. Berukhim and his family were plundering and pillaging the country s
    wealth and assets through establishing a hotel and spending millions of
    Rials of the country s budget in the form of a loan in said hotel; taking
    millions of Rials of currency abroad during the country s critical times;
    establishing an espionage center for American and Israeli operatives and
    their cronies; establishing centers for prostitution and corruption and
    destroying society s moral values; violating workers rights and insulting
    them; having close relations with the wretched Pahlavi [Royal] court and
    cooperating with the defunct SAVAK [the previous regime s security and
    information organization]; the written report by the hotel s workers
    representative and members of the representative council [attesting to]
    Israeli pilots staying at the hotel, his residing at the hotel, and the
    hotel manager cooperating with the Merogroup spy ring under the pretext of
    vegetarianism . (Jomhuri-e Eslami newspaper, May 5, 1980). In the media,
    however, Mr. Berukhim s charge was stated as spying for Israel . (Kayhan
    newspaper, May 5, 1980). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Berukhim and three other individuals
    consisted of testimony of more than 300 workers employed by the hotel;
    currency receipts from a New York bank; existence of Israeli coins and the
    Moshe Dayan medal and other Israeli coins; the Defendant s letters to his
    family; the Berukhim family s connection to the United States; having the
    American flag on his desk; conducting the Jewish Association meetings at
    the hotel; conducting Zionist meetings at the hotel [with the
    participation of people] like Elghanian*; the hotel workers representative
    s written report; having close relations with the wretched Pahlavi court;
    cooperation with the
