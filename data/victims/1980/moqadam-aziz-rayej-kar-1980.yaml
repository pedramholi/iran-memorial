    Mr. Aziz Rayej-Kar Moqadam was sentenced to death by Mr. Sadeq Khalkhali
    for professional and long-term drug trafficing. He was executed in the
    morning. Source : Tehran newspaper Jomhuri Eslami. Mr. Khalkhali's trial
    procedures often lasted only a few hours and the sentences were often
    carried out within hours after they were issued. There was often no
    investogation and in many cases the charges brought against the accused
    have proven to have been baseless.In this case as in many, the report in
    Iran's state-owned newspaper did not inticate that there had been a lawyer
    present by the side of the victim or that the victim had been allowed to
    use his right to appeal the verdict.
