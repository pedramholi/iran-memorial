    The execution of Mr. Nad Ali Taqizadeh, son of Mohammad Ali, born in
    Hamedan and a resident of Tehran, along with 9 other individuals was
    reported by the correspondent of Pars New Agency, quoting the religious
    judge of the Anti-Narcotic Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals. The Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper published the report on July 24, 1980. Arrest and
    detention Based on the report, the defendant was arrested by the Tehran
    Police. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges Mr. Taqizadeh was accused of “having been active in drug
    trafficking since 1957, having a background in robbery, and having drawn
    thousands of young men and women to drugs and prostitution.” The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt Based
    on the report, the defendant was caught in possession of 503 grams of
    heroin. Defense No information is available on the defense. Judgment The
    religious judge of the Anti-Narcotic Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    sentenced Mr. Nad Ali Taqizadeh to death. He was executed early in the
    morning on Wednesday July 23, 1980.
