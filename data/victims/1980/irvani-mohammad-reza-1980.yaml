    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Irvani was reported by the head of the
    Task Force for Combating Drugs and Narcotics in a conversation with the
    correspondent of Pars News Agency. The Jomhuri Eslami daily published the
    news (July 29, 1980). Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are unknown. Trial Based on the report,
    Mr. Irvani s case was examined at the Special Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal for Combating Drugs and Narcotics. The tribunal held session at
    the night of the execution. Charges The head of the Task Force specified
    Mr. Irvani s charges as follows: establishing a modern brothel,12
    kilometers outside Tehran on the Chalus road , establishing an opium den
    complete with heroin consumption devices, alcoholic drinks, gambling, and
    shameful corruption. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report does
    not contain any information regarding the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Irvani was sentenced to death. The sentence was carried out
    immediately after the issuance of the verdict, a couple of hours past
    midnight.
