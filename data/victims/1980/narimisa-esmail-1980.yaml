    The execution of Dr. Esma’il Narimisa was declared in a communiqué of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz regarding the execution of a group
    of eight in this city. The communiqué was quoted as part of the Pars News
    Agency report published in the Ettela’at daily (July 2, 1980). The
    Enqelab-e Eslami daily of June 29, 1980 also reported the news. Additional
    information has been sent to Omid via an electronic form by a relative.
    Dr. Narimisa was born in Haftgerd (Khuzestan province). Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial There is no information regarding this trial. Charges
    Based on the communiqué, Dr. Narimissa was charged with “participation in
    the clashes of Jondishapur University” as well as “planning and
    participating in the conspiracy and flight of prisoners from the town hall
    which led to several deaths and injuries.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    communiqué mentioned that “considering the past records of the accused,
    his position towards the Islamic Republic, the testimonies of witnesses
    and informed individuals, and other material available in his file, it
    became obvious that the above named was one of the most efficient elements
    of the Jondishapur University events and the town hall plot.” Defense No
    information is available concerning the defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz sentenced Dr. Narimisa to death. The Pars
    News Agency report in the Ettela’at daily called attention to a June 27
    communiqué of the Association of Tehran Medical Assistants regarding Dr.
    Narimisa’s case: “The communiqué refers to the efforts of the Association
    to review the problem and gather the documents proving Dr. Narimisa’s
    innocence, their contacts with officials in charge such as the Minister of
    Education, the office of the President, the President’ advisors on legal
    and medical affairs, Mr. Musavi Ardebili, Khamene’i, Sami, Sabaghian,… ,
    and their demand for a public trial during which their documents would be
    reviewed. Finally, [the communiqué] notes that: ‘Despite these persistent
    efforts and the fact that the Prosecutor of Ahvaz had agreed to meet with
    the representatives of the Association and see their documents on June 29,
    we were informed that Dr. Esma’il Narimi’sa was executed by a firing squad
    at dawn on Friday, June 27.’” According to the report, the execution of
    Dr. Narimis’a led to a wave of protest and strike among healthcare
    professionals in the cities of Ahvaz, Shiraz and Tehran. In reaction to
    these events, the Friday Imam of Ahvaz, Hojatoleslam Taheri, speaking in
    the city’s oil workers unity prayer, noted that “in penal matters Islam
    makes no distinction between a doctor, a worker, or a cleric. At the same
    time, in comparable circumstances with regard to the committed sin, the
    punishment for the crime committed by a cleric, a doctor or an engineer is
    heavier and harsher because they are learned and knowledgeable....”
