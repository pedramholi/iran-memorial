    The information about Ms. Fakhri Sheida i, born in Kordestan, was sent to
    Omid by a person familiar with this case. Her name is also mentioned in
    the list of the Fakhaiyan Khalq Organization, Majority Branch, among those
    who were killed or executed. Mr. Sheida i studied fine arts in Tehran. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    After the 1979 Revolution, the organization, which renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority supported and considered the
    Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime. After the
    spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely
    because of their political beliefs. Arrest and detention After Iranian
    universities closed due to the Cultural Revolution in April 1980, Ms.
    Sheida i was traveling from Tehran to Kordestan to visit her family. She
    was arrested near the city of Mahabad (in West Azarbaijan province) along
    with a 17 year old high school student. Based on available information,
    they were both raped while in detention. The Cultural Revolution began
    after Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech in March 1980 and ordered that
    universities be purged of all those who opposed his regime and be
    transformed into learning environments [as opposed to political forums]
    where an all-Islamic curriculum would be taught. The first wave of
    violence began on April 15, 1980 during a speech by Akbar Hashemi
    Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister
    of Interior] at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech, students
    supporting the regime took control of the University s central building
    and demanded that the university be purged from pro-Shah elements and
    other sellouts. On April 18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution issued
    a communiqu accusing political groups of converting higher education
    institutions into headquarters of discordant political activities and
    naming them as obstacles to the radical transformation of the
    universities. The communiqu gave these groups three days (Saturday April
    19 to Monday April 21) to shut down their activities in the universities.
    The Council stressed that the decision included libraries along with
    activities related to arts and sports. Political groups, which recruited
    members and had strong support in the universities, refused to evacuate.
    Before the Council s deadline, serious clashes took place between leftist
    groups and Islamist Associations, which were at times supported by
    security forces and paramilitary groups. These clashes, which peaked at
    the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in the death of several people
    and the wounding of hundreds of others on university campuses around the
    country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic authorities announced the
    victory of the Cultural Revolution and the closure of all universities in
    order to Islamicize the curricula. The universities remained closed for
    two years. One of the outcomes of the Cultural Revolution was the purging
    of many university professors and students based on their political
    beliefs. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against the defendant is not known. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. The source of information
    states that there was no evidence that she belonged to any particular
    oppositional political faction. Defense No information is available on Ms.
    Sheida i s defense. The person familiar with this case believes that she
    was arrested because of the fact that her family is a well-known in
    Kordestan and her brothers were affiliated with the Komaleh Party and the
    Kordish Democratic Party of Iran. Judgment There is no information about
    the verdict leading to this execution. Ms. Sheida i was executed by firing
    squad in November 1980.
