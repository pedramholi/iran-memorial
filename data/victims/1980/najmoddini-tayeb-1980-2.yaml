    Mr. Tayeb Najmoddini is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on
    the list, Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class published on the website Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    1979 Revolution. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have been
    executed. The information about him has been taken from the Peykar
    magazine, No. 96 (August 25, 1980). According to the available
    information, Mr. Najmoddini was a third year medical student at Tabriz
    University and a member of the University and High School Students Section
    of the Peykar Organization. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who converted to Marxism-Leninism. The Peykar
    Organization was also joined by a number of political organizations, known
    as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the
    rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet
    policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a
    social imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention At 5
    a.m. on August 4, 1980, Mr. Najmoddini and a friend, Mr. Mas ud Salehirad,
    were distributing leaflets of the Peykar Organization when they were
    arrested either by agents of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, or by one of
    its subsidiary committees. Trial According to information available, Mr.
    Najmoddini was not summoned to a court or tried before his arrest. Charges
    The charge brought against the defendant is not known. Evidence of guilt
    At the time of his arrest, Mr. Najmoddini was distributing Peykar
    leaflets. Defense No information is available about Mr. Najmoddini s
    defense. Judgment Two hours after Mr. Najmoddini s arrest, a shepherd
    found the bodies of two young men. Next to the bodies, he could see the
    tire marks of a van or a Jeep the same type of vehicle that the
    Revolutionary Guards used. Three days later, the bodies were buried at the
    Vadi Rahmat cemetery in Tabriz as unidentified individuals. On August 15,
    affiliates of the Peykar Organization discovered what had happened. On
    August 18, 1980, a memorial service was held at the cemetery. Family
    members of the two young men were at the memorial service, including Mr.
    Najmoddini s father and uncle, who came from Kordestan.
