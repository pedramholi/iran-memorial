circumstances: >
    The execution of Seyed (Feyz) Mohammad Afruzeh was reported by the
    correspondent of Pars News Agency in Zahedan. The Kayhan and Jomhuri
    Eslami dailies published the report along with a communiqué of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Sistan and Baluchestan (July 5, 1980). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offenses. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention No information is available on the
    circumstances of Mr. Afruzeh’s arrest and detention. Trial The reports
    provide no information regarding the defendant’s trial. Charges Based on
    the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal communiqué, Mr. Afruzeh was charged
    with the following: “sedition”, “armed robbery”, “murdering Constable
    Ahmad Torkamani and stealing his gun”, “creating terror and insecurity”,
    “participation in kidnapping”, and “plotting against the Islamic
    Republic.” Evidence of guilt The reports do not provide any information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment The Revolutionary Tribunal of Sistan
    and Baluchestan found the defendant guilty of “corruption on earth” and
    “waging war against God and his prophet.” Based on the report as published
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily, he was executed at 9 p.m. on a Wednesday.
