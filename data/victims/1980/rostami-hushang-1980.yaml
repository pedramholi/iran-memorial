    the execution of Hushang Rostami, son of Johar and Asadollah, and three
    others, as well as the arbitrary execution of five others in the street,
    was gathered from two interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center (ABC). One interview was with a participant in the Andimeshk

    Additional information was also taken from the IRGC's publicity in the
    Jomhouri-e Eslami, Ettela'at, and Enqelab-e Eslami newspapers (March 17,
    1980); Peykar Magazine, the publication of the Peykar Organization for the

    Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas - Minority; and several

    a high school graduate, and an active member of the Independent Union of
    the Unemployed Workers of Andimeshk. As one of the main organizers of the
    association, he played a leading role in its activities and related
    protests. Mr. Rostami was also a supporter of the People's Mojahedin
    Organization of Iran (PMOI). He was well known and deeply respected among
    the people, particularly for his commitment to helping others. According
    to an eyewitness interviewed by ABC, he and Hamzeh (Hamzeh Shalalvand, who
    was later executed in the 1988 mass execution of political prisoners) were
    always at the forefront of helping the people in their times of joy and
    sorrow (ABC interview with an informed person) His brother, Shamseddin
    Rostami, was also executed in Dezful on June 21, 1982. Mr. Rostami was
    charged with leading political groups and participating in attacks against
    the IRGC during the Andimeshk protests in March 1980. 1980 Andimeshk
    Protest Less than a year after the 1979 revolution, an atmosphere of hope
    emerged among young people seeking justice and social rights. During this
    period, there were numerous protests in cities such as Tehran, Tabriz,
    Mahabad, Sari, Amol, Shiraz, Isfahan, Ilam, Gonbad Kavus, Rasht and
    Abadan, where demonstrators demanded jobs and economic rights. Unemployed
    youth in various regions sought to organize their employment-related
    issues by forming independent associations or unions, free from political
    affiliations. In Tabriz, for example, the " Graduate and Post-Graduate
    Union" was formed, which successfully held meetings with provincial
    authorities and received official recognition from the provincial
    government, allowing it to pursue its goals. Similar organizations in
    other cities, however, faced harsh repression. In one notable incident,
    one person was killed and four others were injured during a crackdown on
    protests by unemployed workers in Isfahan. Unemployed workers'
    associations in Dorud and Andimeshk were also violently repressed. At the
    time, Andimeshk's population had increased due to an influx of migrants
    and wartime displacement, exacerbating social problems in the area. The
    Independent Union of the Unemployed in Andimeshk* was founded after the
    1979 revolution with a focus on workers' rights. It aimed to defend the
    right to work and to protest "appointed hiring practices in state
    institutions and the interference of Islamic associations in employment
    decisions. Early on, union representatives negotiated with the mayor, who
    gave them a room in the city hall. This space became their official
    headquarters and helped them organize their efforts more effectively.
    Union members gathered there daily to hold meetings and send letters to
    Andimeshk authorities demanding jobs for the city's unemployed. Despite no
    official response, the union's activities, such as distributing flyers and
    organizing protests, gained strong support from young people. Between
    3,000 and 4,000 unemployed youth joined the union, paying a small
    membership fee. Despite the mayor's initial cooperation with the union,
    this resulted in a series of disagreements between the mayor's office and
    the governor's office. These disagreements ultimately led to the m
