circumstances: >
    The execution of Ms. Zoya Mohsenkhani was reported by the correspondent of
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Tabriz (June 16, 1980). Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Based
    on the report, Ms. Mohsenkhani s charges were as follows: spreading
    prostitution and committing acts incompatible with chastity, drawing the
    zealous youth to corruption, and not taking the warnings of the court
    seriously after being arrested and undergoing the Hadd penalty several
    times previously for her offenses. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms.
    Mohsenkhani s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Tabriz sentenced Ms. Mohsenkhani to death. She was executed at midnight.
