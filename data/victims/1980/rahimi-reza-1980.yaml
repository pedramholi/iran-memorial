    The execution of Mr. Reza Rahimi, son of Nejat and a resident of Hamedan,
    along with 9 other individuals was reported by the correspondent of Pars
    New Agency, quoting the religious judge of the Anti-Narcotic Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunals. The Jomhuri Eslami newspaper published the report
    on July 24, 1980. Arrest and detention This individual was arrested by the
    Police. No other information is available on Mr. Rahimi s arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges The defendant was charged with drug trafficking. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt Based on the report, the
    defendant was arrested with 21 kilograms of heroin, 765 kilograms of
    opium, and 8 kilograms and 485 grams of morphine. Defense No information
    is available on the defense. Judgment The religious judge of the
    Anti-Narcotic Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Reza Rahmani to
    death. He was executed early in the morning on Wednesday July 23, 1980.
