    The execution of Mr. Hassan Parya i, an employee of the district s
    electric company and father of six, was reported along with four others to
    Pars News Agency by the news center of the Revolutionary Guard
    headquarters of Kerman. The Jomhuri Eslami daily published the report
    (July 5, 1980). Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Parya i s trial. Charges Based on the report, Mr. Parya i was charged
    with having a long history in extramarital sexual relationships and
    sodomy. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report did not
    provide any information regarding the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense.
    Judgment Based on the report, the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman
    sentenced Mr. Hassan Parya i and three other defendants to death by
    stoning. They were stoned to death at 5:30 in the morning. Article 104 of
    the Islamic Republic s Penal Code states that ''...the stones should not
    be too large so that the person dies on being hit by one or two of
    them...'' According to Amnesty International, this punishment "is designed
    to cause grievous pain leading to eventual death." According to Reuters
    news agency, quoting one of the members of Kerman s Tribunal speaking on
    condition of anonymity, the victims were given ablution before the
    ceremony and were given white tunics to wear. Their heads were covered
    with a hood. They were then buried up to their chests. Stones of various
    dimensions were made available. The President of the Tribunal personally
    threw the first stone, followed by five other people. The stoning lasted
    fifteen minutes.
