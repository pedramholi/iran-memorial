    newspapers (March 17, 1980); Peykar Magazine, the publication of the

    a 30-year-old unmarried man, was a member of the Independent Union of the
    Unemployed Workers of Andimeshk. He was of Armenian descent and one of
    Andimeshk's well-known poets. "Shahin was one of the pioneers of modern
    poetry in Andimeshk, and a book entitled "Tolou" (Dawn) was published as
    part of his literary work. He was the only child in his family and lived
    with his elderly mother. According to friends and neighbors, "he was a
    modest and kind-hearted young man. Mr. Dejshekan was also a former boxer
    and a champion in the Golden Olive Leaf boxing competition. He took an
    active part in the meetings and sit-ins of the unemployed workers, giving
    speeches and reciting poems. On March 15, 1980, Mr. Dejshekan participated
    in a peaceful demonstration organized by the Independent Union of the
    Unemployed Workers in Rah Ahan Square in Andimeshk. 1980 Andimeshk Protest
    Less than a year after the 1979 revolution, an atmosphere of hope emerged
    among young people seeking justice and social rights. During this period,
    there were numerous protests in cities such as Tehran, Tabriz, Mahabad,
    Sari, Amol, Shiraz, Isfahan, Ilam, Gonbad Kavus, Rasht and Abadan, where
    demonstrators demanded jobs and economic rights. Unemployed youth in
    various regions sought to organize their employment-related issues by
    forming independent associations or unions, free from political
    affiliations. In Tabriz, for example, the " Graduate and Post-Graduate
    Union" was formed, which successfully held meetings with provincial
    authorities and received official recognition from the provincial
    government, allowing it to pursue its goals. Similar organizations in
    other cities, however, faced harsh repression. In one notable incident,
    one person was killed and four others were injured during a crackdown on
    protests by unemployed workers in Isfahan. Unemployed workers'
    associations in Dorud and Andimeshk were also violently repressed. At the
    time, Andimeshk's population had increased due to an influx of migrants
    and wartime displacement, exacerbating social problems in the area. The
    Independent Union of the Unemployed in Andimeshk was founded after the
    1979 revolution with a focus on workers' rights. It aimed to defend the
    right to work and to protest "appointed hiring practices in state
    institutions and the interference of Islamic associations in employment
    decisions. Early on, union representatives negotiated with the mayor, who
    gave them a room in the city hall. This space became their official
    headquarters and helped them organize their efforts more effectively.
    Union members gathered there daily to hold meetings and send letters to
    Andimeshk authorities demanding jobs for the city's unemployed. Despite no
    official response, the union's activities, such as distributing flyers and
    organizing protests, gained strong support from young people. Between
    3,000 and 4,000 unemployed youth joined the union, paying a small
    membership fee. Despite the mayor's initial cooperation with the union,
    this resulted in a series of disagreements between the mayor's office and
    the governor's office. These disagreements ultimately led to the mayor's
    dismissal. According to union members, the government ignored their
    demands, which included giving priority to hiring local workers. In
    response, the union organized a sit-in at the Ministry
