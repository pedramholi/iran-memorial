    and detention. Trial The circumstances of Mr. Mobarezekhah s trial are not
    known. Charges According to the report, the defendant was accused of
    production, distribution, selling and buying of heroin. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    about the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense The report
    provides no information about the accused s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Hamedan sentenced the five defendants to death.
    Mr. Mobarezekhah and the other four stood before the firing squad at dawn.
