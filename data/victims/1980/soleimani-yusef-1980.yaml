circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Yusef Soleimani was announced by the correspondent of
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Ardebil (July 2, 1980). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The report mentioned that Mr. Soleimani’s trial was public. However,
    the circumstances of the trial remain unknown. Charges Based on the
    report, Mr. Soleimani was charged with “kidnapping children and sexually
    harassing them.” Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains
    no information regarding the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Soleimani’s defense. Judgment
    According to the report, the defendant was sentenced to death for
    “corruption on earth,” and the sentence was carried out at 9 p.m.
