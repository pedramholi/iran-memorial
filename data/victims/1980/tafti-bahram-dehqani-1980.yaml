    Information regarding the extrajudicial execution of Mr. Bahram
    Dehqani-Tafti, son of Bishop Hassan (Ja far) Dehqani-Tafti and Margaret
    Thompson, was obtained from an interview with his sister, Ms. Shirin Ward.
    Additional information was obtained from the book The Hard Awakening (Rev.
    Dehqani-Tafti, 1981), Ettelaat Newspaper (May 8, 1980), Kayhan Newspaper
    (May 8, 1980, and May 11, 1980), Jomhuri Eslami Newspaper (May 17, 1980),
    Kalemeh Magazine (No.41), and ABC News, Australia (February 15, 2015). Mr.
    Bahram Dehqani-Tafti was born on September 22, 1955, in the Christian
    hospital in Esfahan, Iran (Kalemeh Newspaper No. 41). His father, Reverend
    Hassan (Ja far) Dehqani-Tafti, became the first Anglican Bishop in Iran of
    Iranian descent in 1961, serving the Episcopal Church of Iran, and
    remained in the Anglican Church until 1990. Mr. Dehqani-Tafti spent his
    early years with his parents and three sisters in the Anglican compound in
    Esfahan, a campus containing the bishop s home, a school for the blind, a
    church, and a church-run hospital. In 1968, at the age of 12, Mr.
    Dehqani-Tafti embarked on a journey to the United Kingdom to attend
    boarding school. He studied politics, philosophy, and economics at Oxford
    University in England and obtained an M.A. in Economics from George
    Washington University in the United States in 1978 (Ettela at, May 8,
    1980) ( The Hard Awakening ). In the summer of 1978, on the eve of the
    Iranian Revolution, Mr. Dehqani-Tafti returned to Iran and began teaching
    economics and dramatic literature at Damavand College, an all-girls school
    located in northern Tehran (Kalemeh Magazine No. 41). As part of his
    compulsory military service in the late 1970s, he also taught English at
    Tehran University (World Watch Monitor, November 11, 2016). 1 In 1979, Mr.
    Dehqani-Tafti was a translator for foreign journalists residing in Tehran
    who had traveled from around the world to cover the Iranian Revolution,
    including NBC News (Ettela'at, May 8, 1980) (Kalemeh No. 41). On August
    30, 1979, the Dehqani-Tafti home in Isfahan was ransacked by a group of
    unidentified men who destroyed and set fire to the family s office records
    and personal belongings and confiscated papers, journals, and the family s
    photographs. Reverend Dehqani-Tafti, Bahram s father, described their
    behaviors as obviously highly organized ( The Hard Awakening pp. 48-50).
    The local Revolutionary Council took no measures to protect the family or
    investigate the incident. Between February and October 1979, individuals
    from the Islamic Propaganda Society ( Anjoman-e Tablighat-e Eslami )
    progressively took over churches, charitable institutions, and hospitals,
    and removed the funds in the Episcopalian Church s bank accounts, with the
    support of the Revolutionary Committees, and with no objections from the
    authorities The Reverend left Iran to attend a church council meeting in
    Cyprus soon after on the early morning of October 27th, 1979, three armed
    attempted at his life in his bedroom. They missed him but they shot his
    spouse Margaret in the hand. He never returned to Iran ( The Hard
    Awakening pp. 57). Mr. Bahram Dehqani-Tafti continued to live in Tehran,
    and he served as a translator and interpreter for a team of Western
    reporters on a trip to Iranian Kurdistan in April 1980. Kurdish armed
    political groups had been fighting with the Revolutionary Guards and the
    central government forces since the summer of 1979, seeking more autonomy
    in Kurdistan and equal rights. While on this trip, he and the journalists
    met with religious leader Sheikh Ezzedine Hosseini and Abdol-Rahman
    Qasemlu, 2 a prominent Kurdish leader and secretary-general of the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (ABC News Australia, Feb 15, 2015).
    According to one of his journalist colleagues, upon their return to
    Tehran, an unknown individual tried to break into Mr. Dehqani-Tafti s
    apartment on April 30, 1980. He was shaken by the incident but refused his
    friends advice to leave the country, wanting to stay in Iran to protect
    his sisters (Mark Colvin s Blog, July 8, 2020). According to an interview
    with Mr. Dehqani-Tafti s sister, Ms. Shirin Ward, in the days leading up
    to his death (on May 6, 1980), [Bahram] was frightened [...] Friends had
    told him that they were after him. He was staying elsewhere (ABC
    Interview, Shirin Ward, Feb. 7, 2023). Mr. Bahram Dehqani-Tafti, who had
    stayed behind in Iran with his sisters Guli and Shirin, requested a visa
    in the spring of 1980 to attend his sister Susanne s wedding in England.
    The visa was denied, and he refused to leave the country illegally (The
    Hard Awakening pp. 62-63, 82). He was told that the grounds for
    withholding his passport was his father s refusal to relinquish the
    Diocesan Trust Fund, which contained offerings made to the Episcopal
    Church of Iran to support religious, educational, and other charitable
    purposes. The head of the Revolutionary Court who was pressuring Mr.
    Dehqani-Tafti was the same person who had previously
