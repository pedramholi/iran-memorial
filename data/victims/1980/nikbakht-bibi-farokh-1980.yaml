    Information about Ms. Bibi Farokh Nikbakht has been drawn from an
    interview with a relative. Additional information has been taken from the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August 26, 1980. Her name is also mentioned in
    the list of individuals who were executed in relations to the attempted
    Nojeh coup, published by Namir political group. This list contains more
    than 150 names. The interviewee remembers Ms. Nikbakht as a good-natured
    individual with a good sense humor. She was about 58 or 60 years old. Her
    son, Lieutenant Naser Rokni, and her son-in-law, Dr. Majid Vesali, were
    also executed in relations with Nojeh. According to available information,
    the planners of the Nojeh coup were members of the armed forces and the
    Iran Party (social democrat and part of the Iranian National Front) who
    opposed the religious rule and believed in the separation of church and
    state. The core of the coup d’état plan was to fly aircrafts from Nojeh
    base in Hamedan and bomb some military targets as well as the residence of
    Ayatollah Khomeini. Another team was to take over the radio-television
    building in Tehran in order to announce the coup and expose the motives to
    the population. On July 9, 1980, the Islamic Republic of Iran authorities
    announced the discovering and dismantling of a civil and military network
    which had planned the coup d’état to overthrow the regime. Two months
    later, the organization Neghab, in a communiqué, claimed responsibility
    for this attempted ‘uprising.’ The Organization attested that ‘the path of
    Mossadegh is that of the people’ and today ‘Bakhtiar is its authentic
    leader… We have risen up to put an end to this curse [the Islamic regime]
    and to entrust the affairs of our land to the faithful disciple of
    Mossadegh – Shapur Bakhtiar’” (Iran: In Defense of Human Rights, National
    Movement of the Iranian Resistance, Paris, 1983). Following the discovery
    of the plan for the coup, more than sixty officers and civilians were
    executed in several cities of Iran in less than a month. Most of the
    officers were still active in the army and had not been swept away in the
    first wave of purges which took place in the army after the fall of the
    monarchy. Executions of individuals involved in the Nojeh coup continued
    in the months and years to come; at least 200 persons were executed in
    relations to the coup. Nureddin Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh
    Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet communist party) mentioned the coup d’état
    in an article dated May 2, 2000 posted on the Rah-e Tudeh website. Kianuri
    stressed the fact that the military branch of the Tudeh Party, which
    cooperated with the Islamic Republic’s authorities, discovered and
    “neutralized” the above mentioned Organization as well as other groups
    that planned a coup against the newly established regime. Arrest and
    detention No information is available on the circumstances of Ms.
    Nikbakht’s arrest and detention other than she was arrested about 20 days
    prior to her execution (interview). Trial Ms. Nikbakht was tried at a
    Special Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal in Esfehan on August 23, 1980,
    along with three other individuals (newspaper). This trial was later
    broadcast by national television (interview). Charges The Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper reported that Ms. Nikbakht “received all [telephone]
    communications between Esfehan and Tehran and [forwarded them to another
    individual named] Manuchehr Karimi; she had a direct involvement in the
    purchase of 100 guns and paying 700 thousand tumans to Manuchehr Karimi.…”
    In an indictment dated July 19, 1980 (published in the Enqelab Eslami and
    Jomhuri Eslami newspapers a day later) the Public Prosecutor said the
    following regarding some other participants of this alleged coup d’état
    plan: “These enthusiasts of the Shah’s rotten, filthy, and reactionary
    regime, these supporters of the blood-thirsty American imperialism, had in
    mind to bring ‘American social democracy’ as a gift to the liberated
    people of Iran. They had in mind to re-asses the opinion of our heroic
    nation about the return of the royal system through a referendum […].” He
    added: “This conspiracy was not planned in a vacuum and hence cannot be
    described in a single indictment; and these conspirators cannot be
    considered ordinary convicts… Considering that and by consulting the holy
    verses of the Koran regarding the punishment of the ‘rebel’ against the
    Islamic sovereign, it is imperative that the convicts receive their
    punishment according to the Shari’a law.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    newspaper report did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendants. Defense No information is available
    regarding the defense. Ms. Nikbakht was denied the right to be represented
    by an attorney. The interviewee states that her only crime was making her
    house available for some meetings of persons involve
