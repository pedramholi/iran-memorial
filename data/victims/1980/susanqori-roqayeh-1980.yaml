    The execution of Ms. Roqiyeh Susanqori and four others was reported by the
    correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Sabzevar (July 13, 1980).
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Based on the report, the Islamic
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor examined the case at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Sabzevar on July 10, 1980. Charges According to
    the report, the defendant was charged with buying and selling heroin and
    opium and establishing a place of corruption. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms.
    Susanqori s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Sabzevar sentenced Ms. Susanqori to death. The death sentence was carried
    out the day after the trial.
