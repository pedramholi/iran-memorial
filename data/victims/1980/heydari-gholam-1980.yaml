circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Gholam Heidari and four others was reported to Pars
    News Agency by the news center of the Revolutionary Guard headquarters of
    Kerman. The Jomhuri Eslami daily published the report (July 5, 1980). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Heidari’s trial. Charges Based on the report, Mr. Heidari was charged with
    “bringing a boy from Kerman and committing sodomy with him.” Evidence of
    guilt The report did not provide any information regarding the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant’s defense. Judgment Based on the report, the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman sentenced Mr. Heidari to death by firing
    squad. He was shot to death at 5:30 in the morning.
