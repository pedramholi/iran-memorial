    The execution of Mr. Ali Kariminejad (also known as Ali Qazvini, son of
    Ebrahim, born in and resident of Esfahan) and three other individuals was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper (July 22 and 24, 1980). Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Kariminejad was accused of the following charges: carrying and
    selling heroin because of which he had been imprisoned once before, direct
    collaboration with such well-known smugglers who at times benefited from
    the defendant s seditious spirit, and various criminal records including
    robbery, hooliganism, and sodomy. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The July 22 report
    referred to the information in his file and Mr. Kariminejad s confessions
    as the evidence of guilt. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    Based on the news story, Mr. Kariminejad was given a chance to defend
    himself at the court. However, no specific information about the
    circumstances of the defense is available. Judgment The Special Court for
    Combating Drugs and Narcotics declared Mr. Ali Kariminejad a corruptor on
    earth and an enemy of God and his Prophet considering that some of these
    ugly acts were committed during the days of blood and martyrdom (referring
    to the days preceding the success of the Revolution). The Court sentenced
    him to death. Mr. Kariminejad was executed in Esfahan at dawn of July 21,
    1980. He was 26 years old.
