    The execution of Ms. Akhtar Salamat was reported by the head of the Task
    Force for Combating Drugs and Narcotics in a conversation with the
    correspondent of Pars News Agency. The Jomhuri Eslami daily published the
    report (July 29, 1980). Arrest and detention No information is available
    on the circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detentoion. Trial
    Based on the report, Ms. Salamat s case was examined at the Special
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal for Combating Drugs and Narcotics. The
    tribunal held session at the night of the execution. Charges The head of
    the Task Force specified Ms. Salamat s charges as follows: establishing a
    corruption house and an opium den and selling drugs, resulting in the
    corruption of many young boys and girls. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report does not contain any information regarding the evidence presented
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the
    defendant s defense. Judgment Ms. Salamat was sentenced to death. The
    sentence was carried out immediately, a couple of hours past midnight.
