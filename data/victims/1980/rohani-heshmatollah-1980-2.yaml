    During these years, he held posts such as Head of the Social Security

    the Kurosh Kabir Poly Clinic in Shemiran, Tehran. Dr. Rohani was elected

    Iran, September 6, 2021; Baha is of Jasb Website, November 12, 2017) In a
    biography of Dr. Masih Farhangi, one of the Baha is who were executed,
    Kian Sabeti has included this account about Dr. Heshmatollah Rohani; One
    day, a father and son went to a clinic specializing in intellectually
    disabled children. Dr. Rohani was the head of that clinic. The father had
    a letter of recommendation from Dr. Farhangi. Dr. Rohani realized that
    this man was a guard at Evin Prison. When Dr. Farhangi was in prison, he
    had been asked several times to renounce the Baha i Faith. His son,
    Farhang Farhangi, says that in answer to these requests, his father had
    said, I have lived more than sixty years with honesty and uprightness. I
    don t want to compromise my morals for a few more days of life in this
    world. (Iran Wire, December 3, 2020) Dr. Rohani and a private office in
    the south of Tehran, where he tended to impoverished patients. His wife,
    Dr. Mahindokht Khoramianpur, has written about him in Payam Baha i
    publication, Mr. Rohani tended to local patients and provided them with
    free medicine. His humanitarian services were greatly appreciated by all.
    (Iran Wire, April 2, 2020; Baha is of Jasb Website, November 12, 2017) Mr.
    Rohani was an Auxiliary Board Member. In Baha i Administration, the
    Auxiliary Boards are composed of individuals who are appointed by the
    Continental Board of Counsellors for a five-year term. Auxiliary Board
    members carry out their activities in localities within a country. Their
    role is to encourage individuals and to strengthen Baha i communities. In
    relation to Local Spiritual Assemblies, they have a consultative role.
    (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran, September 6, 2021) The Baha is in
    the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background Authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran (the largest minority, with approximately three hundred thousand
    members) [1] to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of
    their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized
    under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities
    refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the
    rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot
    profess and practice their faith and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence. [2] They have been banned from any activities in the public
    realm, and their political, social, and economic rights are constantly
    violated. Baha is are deprived of the right to education, particularly
    higher education, and are banned from holding jobs in the government or in
    government-affiliated entities. They are not even safe and secure in
    owning private businesses, and in many cases, their places of business
    have either been attacked by i
