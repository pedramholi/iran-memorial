    The execution of Mr. Hassan Fajrpir, son of Hossein and a resident of
    Qazvin, along with 9 other individuals was reported by the correspondent
    of Pars New Agency, quoting the religious judge of the Anti-Narcotic
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals. The Jomhuri Eslami newspaper published
    the report on July 24, 1980. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention remain unknown. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The defendant was accused
    of selling heroin and illicit relationship with his own daughter and
    impregnating her. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    about the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information
    is available on the defense. Judgment The religious judge of the
    Anti-Narcotic Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Hassan Fajrpir
    to death. He was executed early in the morning on Wednesday July 23, 1980.
