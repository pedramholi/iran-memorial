    The execution of Third Assistant Lieutenant Siavosh Purfahmideh and 10
    others convicted of participation in an unrealized coup d etat plan known
    as Noje was declared in a communiqu of the Public Relations of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s central office. The communiqu was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (August 7, 1980). In his 07/19/1980
    indictment (published in the Enqelab Eslami and Jomhuri Eslami dailies,
    July 20, 1980), the public prosecutor provided the following necessary
    explanation about some other participants of this coup d etat that was
    never put to practice: This conspiracy is not a single incident and these
    conspirators cannot be considered ordinary convicts. These are criminals
    who have undermined the newly-found truth, honor, and dignity of a
    liberated umma [community of Muslim people]. Considering that and by
    consulting the holly verses of the Koran regarding the punishment of the
    rebel against the Islamic sovereign, it is imperative that the convicts
    receive their punishment according to the Shari a law. Arrest and
    detention No information is available on the circumstances of Lt.
    Purfahmideh s arrest and detention. Trial According to this communiqu ,
    the First Branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center held
    sessions from 08/04/1980 to 08/06/1980 to examine the cases of these
    thirtheen defendants. Charges No individual charges were specified for Lt.
    Purfahmideh. Collectively, the defendants were charged with rebellion
    against the just Imam and the Islamic Republic of Iran and enjoying
    assistance from such powerful supporters as America and Israel. The public
    prosecutor s 07/19/1980 indictment reads as follows regarding some other
    participants of this coup d etat plan: These enthusiasts of the Shah s
    rotten, filthy, and reactionary regime, these supporters of the
    blood-thirsty American imperialism, had in mind to bring American social
    democracy as a gift to the liberated people of Iran. They had in mind to
    re-asses the opinion of our heroic nation about the return of the royal
    system through a referendum [ ]. Evidence of guilt The communiqu did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against the
    defendants. Defense The communiqu indicated that the accused s defense was
    heard, but provided no further specific information. Judgment The First
    Branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center declared Lt.
    Purfahmideh a corruptor on earth and an enemy of God and his prophet and
    sentenced him to death. He was executed at 1 a.m., within hours since his
    trial.
