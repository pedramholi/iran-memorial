circumstances: >
    The execution of Ms. Fereshteh Nargesi was reported by the Pars News
    Agency correspondent in Hamedan. The Jomhuri Eslami daily published the
    report (August 9, 1980). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention No
    information is available on the circumstances of Ms. Nargesi’s arrest and
    detention. Trial The verdict was issued by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Hamedan. The report did not provide any information about the
    trial. Charges Based on this report, Ms. Nargesi was charged with
    “promoting corruption and prostitution” and “selling, buying, and
    distributing drugs”. Evidence of guilt The report did not provide any
    information on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No
    information on the accuseds’ defense is available. Judgment Ms. Nargesi
    was found guilty of “corruption on earth.” She was executed at dawn.
