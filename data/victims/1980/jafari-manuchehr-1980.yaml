    The execution of Mr. Manuchehr Ja’fari, along with that of seven other
    individuals, was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (June 29, 1980) Mr.
    Ja'fari's name is also among the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication

    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest

    part of a group against the Islamic Republic of Iran in the West”, and
    “illegitimate relationship with a married woman.” Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain any information regarding the
    evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is

    Ja’fari was sentenced to death along with seven other defendants convicted
