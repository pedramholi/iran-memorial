    The execution of Mr Hosein Baqadam was reported by the correspondent of
    Pars News Agency. The Jomhuri Eslami daily oublished the report (August 4,
    1980). Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges According to the report, Mr. Baqadam was
    charged with distributing heroin , establishing an opium den , and buying
    and selling guns illegally. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report
    contains no information regarding the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Baqadam s defense.
