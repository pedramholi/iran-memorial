    The execution of Mr. Morteza Soltani and two others convicted of
    participation in an unrealized coup d etat plan known as Noje was reported
    by the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Isfahan (August 18,
    1980). In his 07/19/1980 indictment (published in the Enqelab Eslami and
    Jomhuri Eslami dailies, July 20, 1980), the public prosecutor provided the
    following necessary explanation about some other participants of this coup
    d etat that was never put to practice: This conspiracy is not a single
    incident and these conspirators cannot be considered ordinary convicts.
    These are criminals who have undermined the newly-found truth, honor, and
    dignity of a liberated umma [community of Muslim people]. Considering that
    and by consulting the holly verses of the Koran regarding the punishment
    of the rebel against the Islamic sovereign, it is imperative that the
    convicts receive their punishment according to the Shari a law. According
    to previous reports and communiqu s (Jomhuri Eslami daily, July 20 and 31,
    1980), the network involved in the planning of the coup d etat consisted
    of both military and civilian members. Arrest and detention No information
    is available on the circumstances of Mr. Soltani s arrest and detention.
    Trial Based on the report, the Second Special Branch of the Army s Office
    of Prosecution held session in Isfahan on Thursday evening, 08/14/80, to
    try seven civilians allegedly involved in planning the above-mentioned
    coup d etat. The reading of the indictment by the Army s public prosecutor
    was preceded by the recitation of a few lines from the Holy Koran. The
    trial lasted 5 hours. Charges According to this report, the defendants
    were collectively accused of plotting a potential coup d etat. Although
    the report does not provide any specific information on this un-launched
    coup d etat plot, a previous communiqu of the Army s Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal (Jomhuri Eslami daily, July 20, 1980) indicates that the coup
    d'etat was intended to establish an "American social democratic" regime
    and to organize a referendum so that people could decide on the nature of
    the political regime. Evidence of guilt The report does not provide any
    information on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No
    information on the accused s defense is available. Judgment The Second
    Special Branch of the Army s Office of Prosecution in Isfahan sentenced
    Mr. Soltani to death. The sentence was carried immediately on the night of
    the trial.
