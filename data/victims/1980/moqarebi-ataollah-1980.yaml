    Authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran (the largest minority, with
    approximately three hundred thousand members) [1] to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence. [2] They have been
    banned from any activities in the public realm, and their political,
    social, and economic rights are constantly violated. Baha is are deprived
    of the right to education, particularly higher education, and are banned
    from holding jobs in the government or in government-affiliated entities.
    They are not even safe and secure in
