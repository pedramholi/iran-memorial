    The execution of Mr. Mehdi Rahmati was reported by the correspondent of

    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.

    Charges According to the report, the defendant was charged with carrying
    87 grams of heroin and 255 grams of opium residue and various criminal
    counts such as sodomy, violating people s honor, hooliganism, robbery,
    drunken manifestations, and so forth. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rahmati s defense.

    Isfahan sentenced Mr. Rahmati to death.
