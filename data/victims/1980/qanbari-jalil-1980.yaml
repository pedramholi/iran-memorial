circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Jalil Qanbari and another individual was reported by
    the correspondent of the Kayhan daily in Qazvin (July 5, 1980). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention No information is available on the
    circumstances of Mr. Qanbari s arrest and detention. Trial The report
    provides no information regarding the defendant s trial. Charges Based on
    the report, Mr. Qanbari was charged with the following: loquaciousness ,
    brawling , attacking the Revolutionary Guards , repeated extramarital
    relationships , disrupting the order of the society , showing off his
    power with a dagger , selling young women and girls to debauchers.
    Evidence of guilt The report does not provide any information on the
    evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense of the accused. Judgment The Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Qazvin declared the defendant a corruptor on earth. He was
    executed at dawn.
