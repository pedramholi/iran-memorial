    The execution of Major Mohammad Taqi Sediqi Tonkaboni and another
    individual was reported in the Ettela’at daily (February 19, 1980).
    Additional information has been sent to Omid via an electronic form by an
    individual familiar with this case. The sender of this form remembers
    Major Sediqi Tonkaboni was as “an exemplary pious and liberated
    individual.” He taught at the Police Academy and had been transferred to
    Mazandaran province about a year prior to his arrest. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial There is no information regarding this trial other than Major Sediqi
    Tonkaboni was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sari
    (Mazandaran province). Charges According to the report, the defendant was
    charged with “murder and suppression of demonstrators as well as acting
    towards strengthening the foundations of the detested former regime and
    preventing the spread of the Iranian nation’s Islamic Revolution.” The
    report provides no other information regarding these charges. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence
    presented against the accused. Defense No information is available
    concerning Major Sediqi Tonkaboni’s defense. Judgment According to the
    electronic form, the court condemned Major Mohammad Taqi Tonkaboni to one
    year imprisonment, which he served in Sari prison. When the religious
    judge, Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali was on a trip to prosecute ethnic
    Torkamans, he spent a night in Sari, during which he visited the Sari
    prison. There, he re-tried Major Sediqi Tonkaboni and condemned him to
    death. Based on the newspaper report, the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    of Sari declared Major Sediqi Tonkaboni a “corruptor on earth” and “at war
    with God and His Prophet.” This Tribunal may refer to the same re-trial by
    Aatollah Khalkhali. He personally shot Major Sediqi Tonkaboni with his own
    hand-gun (electronic form).
