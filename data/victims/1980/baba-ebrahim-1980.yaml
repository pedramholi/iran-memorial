circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ebrahim Baba was reported by the correspondent of the
    Jomhuri Eslami daily in Qazvin (July 21, 1980). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Baba s trial. Charges According
    to the report, Mr. Baba was charged with adultery. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report mentioned that the defendant had confessed to adultery four
    times. The report provides no information on the circumstances leading the
    defendant to confess four times against himself. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant s defense. Judgment Mr. Baba was sentenced to
    death.
