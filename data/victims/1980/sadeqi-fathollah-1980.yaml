    The execution of Mr. Fathollah Sadeqi (son of Abolqasem Tonekabzadeh, born
    in and resident of Homayun Shahr (Esfahan province, renamed Khomeini
    Shahr) and three other individuals was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper (July 22 and 24, 1980). Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial other than it took place
    on July 20, 1980. Charges According to the July 22 report, Mr. Sadeqi was
    charged with selling 10 kilograms of opium. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The July 22 report
    referred to the information in his file and Mr. Sadeqi s confessions as
    the evidence of guilt. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    Based on the news story, Mr. Sadeqi was given a chance to defend himself
    at the court. However, no specific information about the circumstances of
    the defense is available. Judgment The Special Court for Combating Drugs
    and Narcotics declared Mr. Fathollah Sadeqi a corruptor on earth and an
    enemy of God and his Prophet and sentenced him to death. He was executed
    in Esfahan at dawn of July 21, 1980.
