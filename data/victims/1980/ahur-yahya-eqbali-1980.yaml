    daily (June 24, 1980) Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information about
    the circumstances of the trial is provided. Charges Based on the report,
    Mr. Eqbali Ahur s charges were as follows: supervision in armed robbery,
    carrying arms illegally, mugging, forming a criminal association,
    destruction of public property, hooliganism, and corruption on earth. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the accused s defense. Judgment The Second Branch of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center sentenced Mr. Eqbali Ahur to
    death and confiscation of all his belongings, except for a home and means
    of life at the level of the socially disinherited people [Mostaz afin].
    Mr. Eqbali Ahur was the only one of 6 armed robbery cases to receive this
    sentence at the Tribunal that day. The sentence was carried out at 11 a.m.
    at the Evin prison yard.
