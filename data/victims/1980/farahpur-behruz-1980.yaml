    The execution of Mr. Behruz Farahpur and another individual was reported
    by Pars New Agency, quoting the Central News Unit. The Enqelab Eslami
    daily published the news (November 1, 1980). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr. Farahpur was accused of
    "carrying a large amount of opium." Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
