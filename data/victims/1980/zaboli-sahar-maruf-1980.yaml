    The execution of Ms. Sahar Ma ruf Zaboli and four others was reported to
    the Pars News Agency by the news center of the Revolutionary Guard
    (Pasdaran) headquarters of Kerman. The Jomhuri Eslami daily published the
    report on July 5, 1980. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Ms. Zaboli s trial. Charges Based on
    the report, Ms. Zaboli was charged with being the head of Kerman s brothel
    and having an effective role in deluding the girls of this city. Evidence
    of guilt The report did not provide any information regarding the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant s defense. Judgment Based on the report, the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman sentenced Ms. Zaboli and three other
    defendants to death by stoning. They were stoned to death at 5:30 in the
    morning. Article 104 of the Islamic Republic's Penal Code states that
    ''...the stones should not be too large so that the person dies on being
    hit by one or two of them...'' and this punishment , according to Amnesty
    International "is designed to cause grievous pain leading to eventual
    death." According to Reuters news agency, quoting one of the members of
    Kerman's Tribunal speaking on condition of anonymity, the victims were
    given ablution before the ceremony and were given white tunics to wear.
    Their heads were covered with a hood. They were then buried up to their
    chests, and stones of various dimensions were made available. The
    President of the Tribunal personally threw the first stone, followed by
    five other people. The stoning lasted fifteen minutes.
