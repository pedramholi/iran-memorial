circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Gholam Reza Haqqani was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily (August 4, 1980). Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Based on the report, Mr.
    Haqani was charged with "sodomy." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report
    contains no information regarding the evidence of guilt presented against
    the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Haqqani’s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Birjand found Mr.
    Haqqani guilty of “corruption on earth.” He was executed at dawn on July
    2, 1980 in Birjand. Gholam Reza was 25.
