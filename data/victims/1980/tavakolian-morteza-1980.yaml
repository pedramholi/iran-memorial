circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Morteza Tavakolian (son of Hassan, born in Ahvaz and
    a resident of Esfahan) and three other individuals was reported in the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper (July 22 and 24, 1980). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to the July 22 report, Mr. Tavakolian was charged with carrying
    and keeping 49 grams and 70 centigrams of heroin and intending to sell 28
    grams and 50 centigrams of that amount. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The newspaper report
    mentioned that Mr. Tavakolian was arrested on his way to where he intended
    to sell heroin to another person. He, then, allegedly led the police
    officers to his house and permitted them to search the place, where they
    discovered 1 gram and 20 centigrams of heroin hidden in a crevice inside a
    wall crack in his bedroom. The report also referred to complaints and the
    witnesses testimonies. Defense Based on the news story, Mr. Tavakolian was
    given a chance to defend himself at the court. However, no specific
    information about the circumstances of the defense is available. Judgment
    The Special Court for Combating Drugs and Narcotics declared Mr. Morteza
    Tavakolian a corruptor on earth and an enemy of God and his Prophet and
    sentenced him to death. He was executed in Esfahan at dawn of July 21,
    1980. He was 28 years old.
