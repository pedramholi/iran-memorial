cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Hosein A’rabi and 13 others was reported by the
    correspondent of the Kayhan daily in Shiraz (July 5, 1980). The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention No information is available on the
    circumstances of the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial The report
    provides no information regarding the defendant’s trial. Charges Based on
    the report, Mr. A’rabi was charged with “keeping and carrying 2,750
    kilograms of heroin.” Evidence of guilt The report does not provide any
    information on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on the accused’s defense. Judgment The religious
    judge at the Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal declared Mr.
    A’rabi a “corruptor on earth” and sentenced him to death. The sentence was
    immediately carried out. Based on the report, he had been sentenced to
    life imprisonment in the previous regime.
