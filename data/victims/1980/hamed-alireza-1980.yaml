    The execution of Mr. Alireza Hamed was reported by the correspondent of

    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are unknown.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Hamed s trial. Charges Based on
    the report, the defendant was charged with participation in armed robbery
    along with harassment and sexual assault to boys and girls as well as
    being sodomized. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report did
    not contain any information regarding the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense.
