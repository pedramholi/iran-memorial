    An armed receptionist, of sorts, for guests of former prime minister
    Bakhtiar in his Neuilly sur Seine apartment. M. Jamme was there to screen
    and protect. Jean-Michel Jamme is one of two individuals killed in the
    assassination attempt of Shapur Bakhtiar, which took place on July 18,
    1980, in the suburb of Paris, Neuilly sur Seine. Information concerning
    this assassination attempt was collected by the French press ( Le Figaro
    July 19, 1980, France Soir July 18, 1980 and July 19, 1980, Le Monde July
    19, 1980, February 27, 1982, March 5, 1982, March 12, 1982, L Express from
    June 14 to June 20, 1980 and of July 26 August 1, 1980). A five-member
    terrorist commando group composed of a Lebanese Christian, Anis Naccache,
    an Iranian member of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, Nejad Tabrizi, a
    Palestinian, Fawzi El Satari, and two individuals, Salah Eddine El Kaara
    and Mohamed Jenab, of either Syrian or Lebanese descent according to
    different sources, carried out the July 18, 1980, attack at the apartment
    building in Neuilly sur Seine where Mr. Bakhtiar resided. The commando
    group arrived at the building at 8:45 am, carrying silencer guns and press
    cards from the newspaper L Humanite (affiliated to the French Communist
    Party). The police officers assigned to Bakhtiar s protection allowed them
    to enter the building's lobby where Jean-Michel Jamme was in charge of
    informing Bakhtiar of visitors through the lobby's intercom. He was shot
    before he could call Bakhtiar s apartment. The commandos then reached the
    second floor where Bakhtiar s apartment was located and mistakenly knocked
    on his neighbor s door. The commandos shot Yvonne Stein dead as soon as
    she opened the door, and also wounded her sister. When the commandos
    finally rang the door bell of Bakhtiar s apartment, the latter s cousin,
    suspicious of the early-hour visit, attached the door s security chain
    before opening it. The commandos shot through the door crack but failed to
    gain access to the apartment and complete its mission. The members of the
    commando group were arrested as they were leaving the building. They were
    detained and interrogated by French police. At all stages of the judicial
    process, they claimed responsibility for their acts. They were charged
    with murder by the Criminal Court of Hauts de Seine, which held hearings
    from February 5 to March 10, 1982. The accused refused to attend their
    trial (except for one hearing), deeming the Court incompetent, since,
    according to them, only Allah is a judge . All the members of the commando
    group were sentenced to life imprisonment except for Fawzi El Satari who
    was sentenced to twenty years. Jean-Michel Jamme s name is in OMID with
    victims of human rights violations by the Islamic Republic of Iran,
    because the available information indicates that he was shot by agents of
    the Islamic Republic of Iran in the course of the assassination attempt
    against Shapur Bakhtiar, for which Iranian authorities later claimed
    responsibility. During the only hearing he attended, the head of the
    commando group, Naccache, argued that the assassination plan was based on
    a verdict issued by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal in Tehran. ( Le
    Monde , March 10, 1982) Mr. Bakhtiar s assassination attempt was claimed
    immediately on July 19, 1980 in a communiqu issued by the Revolutionary
    Guards and read on the official Radio-Tehran . In an interview given to L
    Express magazine published during the week of June 14-20, 1980, Ayatollah
    Khalkhali, designated by Khomeini as the Head of the Islamic Revolutinary
    Tribunal, stated that Bakhtiar was on his blacklist and that a commando
    unit was in charge of killing him (p 141). Le Figaro on July 19, 1980,
    also mentioned the blacklist in which Bakhtiar s name follows some
    relatives of the former Shah. Khalkhali said: "I have sent a commando unit
    to get him, he can not escape us". Furthermore, in an interview given to
    the newspaper Le Monde on December 1, 1992, Anis Naccache explained that
    "At the time, killing the former prime minister under the Shah was a
    political necessity and legally justified". Anis Naccache made headline
    news again during a bombing campaign that hit France between February1985
    and May 1986 that killed 14 and injured 335 people. Responsibility for
    these attacks was claimed by Islamist groups close to the Lebanese
    Hezbollah, which received ideological guidance and logistical support from
    the Islamic Republic. After the bombings, those responsible called for the
    liberation of three people imprisoned in France, including Anis Naccache
    of the Jihad (Didier Bigo in Culture and Conflicts n 4 (1992) pp.
    147-173). On July 27, 1990, President Mitterand pardoned Anis Naccache,
    the leader of the commando group and his accomplices. Naccache left for
    Tehran and reportedly has lived between the Iranian capital and Beirut
    ever since. On August 6, 1991 Shapur Bakhtiar, and his assistant, Soroush
    Katibeh, were assassinated in Suresnes (a Paris suburb where Bakhtiar had
    lived since the 1
