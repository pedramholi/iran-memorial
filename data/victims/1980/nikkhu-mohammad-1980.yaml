circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Nikkhu and three others was announced in a
    report by the correspondent of Pars News Agency in Tabriz, published in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily (November 10, 1980). Arrest and detention The
    report provided no information on the circumstances of Mr. Nikkhu s arrest
    and detention. Trial No specific information was provided on Mr. Nikkhu s
    trial. Charges Mr. Nikkhu, from Bukan, was charged with sodomy and
    repeated robbery as well as rebellion against the Islamic Revolution and
    cooperation with the outlawed Democratic Party of Kurdistan. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on the
    evidence presented against the defendant. Defense The report provided no
    information about the defendant s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz declared Mr. Nikkhu an enemy of God. He
    was executed at night.
