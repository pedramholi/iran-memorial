    The execution of Mr. Habibollah Ra isi, son of Vali Morad and born in

    Reportedly, the defendant was one of the distributors of drugs in several
    cities. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.

    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The defendant was reported to have several
    counts of criminal activity and was arrested with 9 kilograms and 800
    grams of opium. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The religious judge of the Anti-Narcotic Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal sentenced Mr. Habibollah Ra isi to death. He was executed early
    in the morning on Wednesday July 23, 1980.
