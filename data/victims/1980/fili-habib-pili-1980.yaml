    The execution of Mr. Habib Pili (Fili) and 15 others was reported by the
    correspondents of the Jomhuri Eslami and Kayhan dailies in Shiraz (July 5,
    1980). Arrest and detention The circumstances of this individual s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial Based on the Jomhuri Eslami report, the
    religious judge traveled to Shiraz and, after visiting the Revolutionary
    Guard (Pasdaran) headquarters of Shiraz, headed for the Shiraz Tribunal,
    where he examined the cases of sixteen individuals charged with a range of
    crimes from killing and suppression of revolutionary combatants to drug
    dealing and sodomy. Mr. Pili (Fili) was one of the defendants. Charges
    Based on the Kayhan report, Mr. Pili (Fili) was charged with buying and
    selling drugs and sodomy. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The reports contain no
    information regarding the evidence presented against the defendant at the
    trial. Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense.
    Judgment The judge sentenced the defendant to death. The Jomhuri Eslami
    report specifies that the sentence included confiscation of property for
    six of the accused. It is not clear whether or not Mr. Pili (Fili) s
    properties were confiscated.
