During the years of his service at SAVAK he tortured many revolutionary combatants in the most savagely brutal ways so that many of them, including Rezayi, Khalil Tabatabai, Moqayadi, Dibaj and others, were martyred.”"

    The execution of Mr. Farajollah Seifi Kamangar was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily (June 10, 1980). Arrest and detention Based on the report,
    Mr. Kamangar was arrested by Revolutionary Guards towards the end of the
    year 1979 in Evin Prison, where he allegedly had gone to receive his
    salary. Trial The report mentioned that the defendant was tried at the
    First Branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal “a while ago.” The
    final verdict, however, was issued on the morning before the sentences
    were carried out. Charges Regarding Mr. Kamangar’s charges, the report
    reads as follows: “Seifollah Faraji Kamangir, the torturer and SAVAK
    interrogator also known as Dr. Kamali, joined the hated SAVAK since its
    very founding in 1335 [1957]. During the years of his service at SAVAK he
    tortured many revolutionary combatants in the most savagely brutal ways so
    that many of them, including Rezayi, Khalil Tabatabai, Moqayadi, Dibaj and
    others, were martyred.” Evidence of guilt The report mentioned that in Mr.
    Kamangar’s trial sessions, a number of revolutionary combatants previously
    tortured by him, including Lotfollah Meysami, Hojatoleslam Ma’adikhah,
    Hojatoleslam Mahallati and others, appeared to describe the nature and
    manner of tortures. Defense No information is available on Mr. Kamangar’s
    defense. Judgment The report quoted the communiqué of the Public Relations
    Unit of the Chief Revolutionary Public Prosecution Office regarding this
    case as follows: “And for you in the Law of Talion [Qisas] there is life;
    O ye men of understanding.” [The Koran; 2:179] God’s hand came out of the
    sleeve of the Muslim masses and took its revenge from beastly criminals.
    The same criminals who, with a smile on their faces, raised their hands to
    strike lashes on the bare skin of our beloveds. The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of the Center sentenced the one responsible for the blood of our
    beloveds to 500 lashes and capital punishment in order to give him a taste
    of earthly torment and agony before suffering eternal perdition in the
    Other World. He was executed at 10 a.m. in the Evin prison yard.” The
    report mentions that the defendant was executed in the afternoon. Whether
    at 10 a.m., according to the communiqué, or in the afternoon, based on the
    report, the sentence was carried out within minutes to hours after the
    issuance of the verdict. Mr. Kamangar’s body was transferred to the morgue
    for a death certificate.
