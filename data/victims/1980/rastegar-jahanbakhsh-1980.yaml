    . The execution of Mr. Jahanbakhsh Rastegar and another individual was
    reported by the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Yasuj (July
    24, 1980). Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Rastegar was charged with possession of
    14 kilograms and 250 grams of Opium. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no information regarding the evidence provided against
    the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rastegar's
    defense. Judgment The Special Court for Combating Drugs and Narcotics
    sentenced Mr. Rastegar to death. He was executed at dawn.
