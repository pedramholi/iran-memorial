    Ali Bazjanbazlu was a sympathizer of Rah-e Kargar or the "Revolutionary
    Workers Organization of Iran." It was established in 1979 by a group of
    leftist activists who rejected the idea of armed struggle.
    Marxist-Leninist, the group promoted a socialist revolution and the
    leadership of the proletariat. Unlike the pro-Soviet communist Tudeh
    party, Rah-e Kargar opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Ali Bazjanbazlu was murdered on August 25, 1980. Information
    regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Alibaz Janbazlu (Haji Khan
    Rezai)*, son of Belqeis and Mr. Khalifeh Rezai, was obtained from an
    electronic form submitted to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center by a person
    close to him (August 11, 2022), and a letter written by Mr. Allahgholi
    Khan Jahangiri to Ayatollah Khomeini, available on the Gozareshgaran (
    Reporters ) website (August 28, 1980). According to available information,
    Mr. Alibaz Janbazlu (Rezai) was 25 years old, single, and born in the town
    of Mahur in Fars Province. He was born in a migrant tribe family. His
    family made a living raising livestock. He had seven brothers and sisters.
    He attended elementary school in the village of Khumezar near Nurabad
    Mamasani in Fars Province. He went to the town of Shahreza in 1971-72 to
    continue his education, and subsequently obtained a trade school diploma
    and began working in a construction company. According to one of his
    relatives, Alibaz was a person who felt a sense of obligation toward
    society and to the people close to him, and liked hiking, horseback
    riding, trekking in nature, music, poetry, and technique . Mr. Janbazlu
    (Rezai) was an adolescent in 1973-74, when he became interested in
    politics. He was a leftist and a socialist and leaned toward the guerilla
    movement of the time; he was arrested and sentenced to three years in
    prison by a military tribunal under the previous regime. In addition to
    his studies, he engaged in other studies and in organizing political
    discussions, and discussions about hiking, with young people. (Electronic
    form). After the 1979 Revolution, the [Islamic] regime called the movement
    the Allahgholi Jahangiri** Group because of its independent stance in
    emphasizing the people s participation in deciding their own destiny in
    the form of councils; the sentences issued [for the movement] also labeled
    the movement the Allahgholi Jahangiri grouplet . (Electronic form). Mr.
    Janbazlu (Rezai) participated in the anti-Shah protests. Shahreza was the
    first city in Iran that was freed by the late Alibaz and his brothers in
    arm without bloodshed, with the city and its military centers falling into
    the people s hands in early February 1979. After the prisons were opened
    and his brothers in arm were released, he became active in independently
    organizing the workers and tribes professional and political demands, and
    began his activities in the central [Iran] Provinces. (Electronic form).
    Shahreza was a place for the presentation of various publications and for
    conducting discussions, and the city s combatants started to establish
    councils. The councils activity revolved around agricultural reform and
    elimination of landowners profiteering . The city councils were attacked
    by [government] agents around [March] 1979. Around early March, 1979,
    [they] were attacked by the agents, and Mr. Janbazlu and his brothers in
    arm were forced to retreat among the people in villages and tribes.
    (Electronic form). The agents attacks on the regions combatants continued;
    they were trying to label the leaders of the movement as lawless
    insurgents, and were trying to eliminate them. The attacks continued
    extensively and intermittently beginning in March 1979. In September 1979,
    following another one of these unsuccessful attacks, the government
    distributed the names of 20 of the movement s leaders in the region by
    helicopter, labeling them as insurgents and apostates, and the late Alibaz
    name was among them. (Electronic form). Mr. Janbazlu (Rezai) participated
    in organizing protests against Qashqai tribe s leaders on July 28, 1980.
    (Allahgholi Jahangiri s letter to Khomeini Background of Extrajudicial
    Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has
    a long history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the
    world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and
    outside the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing
    a large number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable.
    The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is
    not clear; however, these murders began in February 1979 and have
    continued since then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran
    attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been
    assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
