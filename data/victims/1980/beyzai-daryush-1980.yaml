    The execution of Mr. Daryush Beyzayi and 15 others was reported by the
    correspondents of the Jomhuri Eslami and Kayhan dailies in Shiraz (July 5,
    1980). According to the Shiraz correspondent of the Enqelab Eslami daily
    of the same date, the religious judge who had attended the Friday Sermon
    in Shiraz spoke before performing the prayer while announcing the news:
    “As I was busy examining the cases of drug dealers, the President asked me
    in a telephone conversation to examine the cases of first rate criminals
    with political charges and issue the verdict based on the Shari’a law. I
    requested that the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor of Shiraz give us what
    they have at the Revolutionary Tribunal. Unfortunately, these files were
    not passed on to us, and therefore I sentenced five people to death based
    on what was available at the prison or the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
    headquarters, and considering the testimonies of witnesses and unbiased
    individuals. One or two of these five people were already tried at the
    court and sentenced to life imprisonment, but I sentenced them to death,
    considering the crimes they had committed; and I think it was not even
    necessary to read their files. The death sentences... were carried out
    today at dawn, and this was my Islamic and human duty and I have done my
    job in accordance with Shari’a standards.” The report of the Friday Sermon
    speech points to the fact that these executions caused disagreement among
    the clerics. In response to his critic, the religious judge said: “The
    gentleman who has been silent so far and has not shown the slightest
    reaction to the blood of our martyrs, has telephoned certain people last
    night, telling them that I have acted illegally. It must be said to him
    that it is none of his business. It would only be fair if I performed my
    duty to defrock this pseudo-cleric so that other pseudo-clerics do not
    dare present themselves against the Islamic nature of Iran. Through such
    exchanges, they tried to take these first rate criminals away from me and
    laugh at the blood of our martyrs. But we'll take revenge on our enemies;
    our nation will not listen to such nonsense and phone calls.” Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this individual’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial Based on the Jomhuri Eslami daily report, the religious
    judge traveled to Shiraz and, after visiting the Revolutionary Guard
    (Pasdaran) headquarters of Shiraz, headed for the Shiraz Tribunal, where
    he examined the cases of sixteen individuals charged with a range of
    crimes from killing and suppression of revolutionary combatants to drug
    dealing and sodomy. Mr. Beyzayi was one of the defendants. Charges Mr.
    Beyzayi was charged with “being a factor in people’s massacre on February
    11, 1979” in Shiraz. Evidence of guilt The reports contain no information
    regarding the evidence presented against the defendant at the trial.
    Defense No information is available on the defendant’s defense. Judgment
    The judge sentenced the defendant to death. The Jomhuri Eslami daily
    report specifies that the sentence included confiscation of property for
    six of the accused. It is not clear whether or not Mr. Beyzayi’s
    properties were confiscated.
