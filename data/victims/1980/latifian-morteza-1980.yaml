    The execution of Mr. Morteza Latifian was reported in the Ettela at daily
    (January 29, 1980). The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial There is no specific information available on the circumstances of
    Mr. Latifian s trial. Charges While referring to Mr. Latifian as a
    well-known capitalist and usurer, the report did not specify the exact
    charges for which the accused was convicted at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal. Evidence of guilt Based on the report, the verdict was issued
    considering the public prosecutor s indictment at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal . However, the contents of the indictment regarding
    the accused s evidence of guilt are not clear. Defense No information is
    available on the accused s defense. Judgment Declared a "corruptor on
    earth" and an "enemy of God" by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Isfahan, Mr. Latifian was sentenced to death. He was consequently
    executed.
