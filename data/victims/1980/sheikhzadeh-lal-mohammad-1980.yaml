circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Lal Mohammad Sheikhzadeh and two other convicts was
    announced in a communiqu by the Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of
    Sistan and Baluchestan published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (June 7,
    1980). Arrest and detention No information is available on the
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention. Trial The
    communiqu provides no information regarding Mr. Sheikhzadeh s trial.
    Charges According to the communiqu , the defendant was accused of armed
    robbery, making the roads insecure, and resisting the Islamic Republic s
    armed forces. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    about the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense The report
    provides no information about the accused s defense. Judgment Mr.
    Sheikhzadeh was sentenced to death.
