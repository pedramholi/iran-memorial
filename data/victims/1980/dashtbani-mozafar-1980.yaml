circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mozafar Dashtbani and 15 others was reported by the
    correspondents of the Jomhuri Eslami and Kayhan dailies in Shiraz (July 5,
    1980). The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought
    trumped up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this individual’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial Based on the Jomhuri Eslami report, the religious judge
    traveled to Shiraz and, after visiting the Revolutionary Guard (Pasdaran)
    headquarters of Shiraz, headed for the Shiraz Tribunal, where he examined
    the cases of sixteen individuals charged with a range of crimes from
    killing and suppression of revolutionary combatants to drug dealing and
    sodomy. Mr. Dashtbani was one of the defendants. Charges The Jomhuri
    Eslami report mentioned Mr. Dashtbani’s charges as “drug dealing” and
    “sodomy.” Kayhan did not refer to the charge of “sodomy” at all. Evidence
    of guilt The reports contain no information regarding the evidence
    presented against the defendant at the trial. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant’s defense. Judgment The religious judge
    sentenced the defendant to death. The Jomhuri Eslami report specifies that
    the sentence included confiscation of property for six of the accused. It
    is not clear whether or not Mr. Dashtbani’s properties were confiscated.
