    The execution of Mr. Hossein Aghzabi and 15 others was reported by the
    correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Shiraz (July 5, 1980). Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this individual s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial Based on the report, the religious judge traveled to
    Shiraz and, after visiting the Revolutionary Guard (Pasdaran) headquarters
    of Shiraz, headed for the Shiraz Tribunal, where he examined the cases of
    sixteen individuals charged with a range of crimes from killing and
    suppression of revolutionary combatants to drug dealing and sodomy. Mr.
    Aghzabi was one of the defendants. Charges Based on the report, Mr.
    Aghzabi was charged with being a drug dealer. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report contains no
    information regarding the evidence presented against the defendant at the
    trial. Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense.
    Judgment The judge sentenced the defendant to death. The report specifies
    that the sentence included confiscation of property for six of the
    accused. It is not clear whether or not Mr. Aghzabi s properties were
    confiscated.
