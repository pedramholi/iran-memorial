    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Mehdikhani, born in Qazvin and a resident of
    Pamonar in Tehran, was declared in a communiqu of the Public Relations
    Office of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards (Pasdaran). The communiqu was
    published by the Jomhuri Eslami daily (August 10, 1980). Arrest and
    detention No information is available on the circumstances of Mr.
    Mehdikhani s arrest and detention. Trial The communiqu specified that the
    defendant was tried in the Special Islamic Revolutionary Court for
    Campaign against Drugs and Narcotics but did not provide any information
    about the trial. Charges Based on the communiqu , Mr. Mehdikhani was
    charged with adultery . The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against the defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentenced to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report did
    not provide any information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information on the accused s defense is available.
    Judgment Mr. Mehdikhani was found guilty of corruption on earth and war
    against God. He was sentenced to death and executed at 1 a.m.
