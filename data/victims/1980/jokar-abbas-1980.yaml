circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Abbas Jokar was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily
    (August 14, 1980). Arrest and detention No information is available on the
    circumstances of Mr. Jokar s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    about the trial is available in the report. Charges Based on the report,
    the defendant s charges were as follows: selling drugs, establishing an
    Opium House, committing unchaste acts, misguiding innocent children, being
    a number one torturer for the dissolved SAVAK of Qom, and plotting against
    the Islamic Republic of Iran. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentenced to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report did
    not provide any information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information on the accused s defense is available.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Qom declared Mr. Jokar a
    corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death.
