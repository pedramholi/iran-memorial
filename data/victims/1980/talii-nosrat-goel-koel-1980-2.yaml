    was arrested instead of someone else. Her trial was held immediately and
    she was executed a few hours later. The news of the execution on Mrs.
    Nosrat Goel (Koel) Tali i, daughter of Ozra and Janjan, along with 13
    other people* was published in Keyhan and Jomhury-e Eslami newspapers on
    July 5, 1980. Additional information regarding this execution was obtained
    through BBC Persian website (February 11, 2018), Mohsen Kadivar s website
    (October 1, 2016), Akhbar-e Ruz website (May 4, 2008), Shahyad Magazine in
    Israel, and the archive of Ettela at (July 5, 1980), Keyhan (July 5,
    1980), and Enqelab-e Eslami (July 5 and 12, 1980) newspapers. Mrs. Goel
    Tali i was a Jewish resident of the city of Shiraz and worked in a women s
    hair salon. She was married with four children and expecting her fifth
    child when she was arrested (Akhbar-e Ruz website). According to her
    family, Mrs. Goel Tali i has spent all her life laboring hard to help her
    family make ends meet (Mohsen Kadivar s website). Mrs. Goel Tali i s case
    was related to sexual and drug offenses in 1979 in Shiraz.Mrs. Goel Tali i
    has spent all her life laboring hard to help her family make ends meet.
    Background of July 3, 1980 s executions in Shiraz Since the Friday Prayer
    Imam in the city of Shiraz (Seyed Abdolhossein Dastgheib) and the
    commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard of Fars Province (Mas'ud
    Khatami) were not satisfied with the judgments made by a local religious
    judge, on July 3, 1980, the Friday Prayer Imam in the city of Shiraz sent
    a telegram to Ayatollah Khalkhali, who was the religious judge and head of
    Islamic Revolutionary Court for drug-related crimes, requesting that
    Khalkhali travel to Shiraz to review judicial cases. In his message, he
    wrote: No one has been given a revolutionary execution in Shiraz, and this
    is a disgrace to Shiraz. Ayatollah Khalkhali entered Shiraz before noon
    that day and went directly to the Revolutionary Guards camp, went to
    Adelabad Prison with a number of armed guards, and brought 23 prisoners
    before a revolutionary tribunal. Those individuals were previously tried
    by the religious judge in the city of Shiraz and sentenced to imprisonment
    or were still in the process of prosecution (Akhbar-e Ruz and Mohsen
    Kadivar websites). A woman named Zahra was supposed to be tried along with
    those 23 prisoners (Akhbar-e Ruz website). Arrest and detention On July 3,
    1980, the Revolutionary Guards officers in Shiraz arrested Mrs. Goel Tali
    i in the hair salon where she worked. After being arrested, she was
    immediately transferred to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Headquarters
    in Shiraz (Jomhury-e Eslami newspaper, Akhbar-e Ruz website). Mrs. Goel
    Tali i was not allowed to visit her father, mother, husband or children
    after being arrested (Mohsen Kadivar website). The court tried Mrs. Goel
    Tali i and 23 others until 11:00 PM, and all sentences were implemented by
    12:00 PM. Trial On the afternoon of July 3, 1980, Ayatollah Khalkhali, the
    religious judge and head of the Special Islamic Revolutionary Court, tried
    Mrs. Goel Tali i and 23 others at the same time at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Guards Headquarters in Shiraz. According to available
    reports, the proceedings continued until 11:00 PM, and all sentences were
    implemented by 12:00 PM (Akhbar-e Ruz website). The trial court for all 24
    defendants lasted about nine hours, and this session was held without the
    presence of a lawyer and without defendants being able to access judicial
    records (Mohsen Kadivar website). Charges Official newspapers cited
    different charges for Mrs. Goel Tali i. The Jomhury-e Eslami newspaper
    counted operating an opium den and drug trafficking as Mrs. Goel Tali i s
    charges. Meanwhile, charges reported by Ettela at newspaper were
    corrupting girls and selling them to men , and in the Kayhan newspaper
    operating house of debauchery and drug trafficking (Mohsen Kadivar website
    quoting Ettela at newspaper, July 5, 1980, page 3 and Kayhan newspaper,
    July 5, 1980, the last page). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Statements made by one of the Revolutionary
    Guards against her were used as the sole evidence to prove Mrs. Goel Tali
    i s charge. Evidence of guilt Statements made by one of the Revolutionary
    Guards against her were used as the sole evidence to prove Mrs. Goel Tali
    i s charge. According to the former commander of the Revolutionary Guards
    in Shira
