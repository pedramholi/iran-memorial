circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Qasem Ramezani and two others was reported by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Isfahan. The report was published in the
    Ettela at daily (Jan 12, 1980) The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.

    Ramezani was charged with involvement in the armed robbery of the Enqelab
    Square branch of Bank-e Iranian in Isfahan. The announcement of the

    employees were about to transfer half a million Tomans and some checks and
    documents to the Sugar Factory branch of Bank-e Iranian, they were
    subjected to an armed attack planned by Mohammad Mehdi Rastini, directed
    by Mohsen Rastini, and with the direct collaboration of the rest of the
    defendants. The armed group succeeded in their robbery and the bank
    employees were injured." Evidence of guilt The Revolutionary Tribunal does
    not mention the evidence presented against the defendant. It notes,
    however, that the verdict was based the contents of the [defendants] file
    and their own clear confessions as well as other available proofs .
