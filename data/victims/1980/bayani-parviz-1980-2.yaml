    Mr. Parviz Bayanii is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993
    report published by the Baha i International Community. The report
    documents the persecution of the members of the Baha'i faith in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978.
    Additional information has been drawn from various issues of the The Baha
    i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. The Baha is in
    the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background "Baha'i is not a religion, it is
    a political party. It is a party that was initially supported by the
    British and is now supported by America. They [the Baha'is] are spies...
    Ayatollah Khomeini, Founder of the Islamic Republic* The Qur an recognized
    only the People of the Book as religious communities. Others are pagans.
    Pagans must be eliminated. Iranian Attorney General, Seyed
    Moussavi-Tabrizi** the punishment for a Mortad-e Fetri [apostate who was
    born in a Muslim family] is death and his repentance is not accepted. Head
    of the Islamic Republic Revolutionary Courts, Ayatollah Gilani*** The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran (the largest minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members) to systematic harassment and
    persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The
    Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic
    Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result,
    the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status of a
    religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith and are
    banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice
    has subjected them to abuse and violence. The Islamic Republic Penal Code
    grants no rights to Baha'is, and the courts have denied them the right to
    redress or to protection against assault, murder, and other forms of
    persecution and abuse. In so doing, the courts have treated Baha'is as
    unprotected citizens or "apostates," citing eminent religious authorities
    whose edicts are considered to be a source of law equal to acts of
    Parliament. The Founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, made
    execution a punishment for the crime of apostasy and decreed that a Muslim
    would not be punished for killing an apostate. Banishment from public
    functions has seriously damaged the Baha is professional, economic, and
    social lives. Soon after the revolution, a Ministry of Labor directive
    called for the dismissal from public office and all governmental
    organizations and associations those "who belong to any of the misguided
    sects recognized by all Muslims as heretical deviations from Islam, or to
    organizations whose doctrine and constitution are based on rejection of
    the divinely-revealed religions." Finally the mandatory requirement of
    specifying religion in application forms and official documents (lifted
    recently in some areas under international pressure) has seriously limited
    Baha'is' freedoms and opportunities in all areas of their lives including
    divorce, inheritance, access to universities, and travel. In practice,
    since 1980, thousands of Baha'is have lost their jobs, pensions,
    businesses, properties, and educational opportunities. By banning the
    Baha'i organization, an elected spiritual body that administers the
    affairs of the faith at both local and national levels, the Islamic
    Republic has denied Baha'is the right to meet, elect, and operate their
    religious institutions. Further, the Iranian government has executed at
    least 200 Baha'is and has imprisoned, tortured, and pressured to convert
    to Islam scores more. Because of the unanimous international condemnation
    of the persecution of this quietist (apolitical) religious community,
    Iranian authorities do not always admit that the Baha'is are being
    punished for their religious beliefs. Therefore, judicial authorities have
    often charged Baha'is with offenses such as "being involved in
    counter-revolutionary activities," "having supported the former regime,"
    "being agents of Zionism," or "being involved with prostitution, adultery,
    and immorality." Arrest and detention No information is available on the
    circumstances of this defendant's arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Bayani's trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Bayani are not known. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Bayani's defense. However, the
    representatives of the Baha'i community stress that their members are
    being persecuted for their religious beliefs. They note that Baha'is'
    requests to access their files are usually denied, and access to attorneys
    is often denied. They refute the validity of charges such as
    counter-revolutionary political activities or spying leveled against them
    in Iranian courts. They point out that the fundamental principles of their
    religion require them to show loyalty and obedie
