    A trusted and well respected notable of Farse region, he wanted to see
    freedom established in Iran, but he was disillusioned with the outcome of
    the revolution and did not vote for the Islamic Republic. The information
    about Mr. Mohammad Khan Zarghami Baseri s assassination on December 31,
    1980, is based on an electronic form sent to Omid by one of his children
    and an interview with her. Additional information has been drawn from Mr.
    Abdollah Shahbazi s website, who is one of the founders of the
    Tehran-based Political Studies and Research Institute and its manager from
    the time of establishment in 1988 until 1998. Mr. Zarghami Baseri was born
    in the Baseri tribe in 1923 and had 6 children. In addition to being a
    farmer, he was an influential figure in the region, the sheriff of his
    tribe in Qasrodasht Kamin (located in the southern province of Fars). When
    disagreements or fights broke out among the local residents and tribes,
    the parties went to Mr. Zarghami Baseri to mediate, as opposed to local
    state officials and courts. During the monarchy, at the time of the Shah s
    land reforms, Mr. Zarghami Baseri was imprisoned and exiled for his
    disagreement with the state policy. Before the Revolution of 1979, he
    provided financial support for demonstrations opposing the monarchy. After
    February 1979, he was disillusioned with the outcome of the revolution,
    and did not participate in the referendum of April 1979. He even thought
    of leaving the country and refrained from further political activities.
    According to his daughter, Mr. Zarghami Baseri wanted to lead a peaceful
    family life. He enjoyed reading. He learned English in prison. He loved
    Marzieh s songs (a well-known Iranian singer). In the morning of December
    31, 1980, Mr. Zarghami Baseri and one of his employees were riding his
    vehicle toward his farm in Qasrodasht Kamin when they were shot and killed
    by Revolutionary Guards of Arsenjan (located in Fars Province). Mr.
    Zarghami Baseri was shot 11 times and his employee (whose name is not
    known) was shot once in the face. Mr. Zarghami Baseri s daughter states
    that after the assassination, the Revolutionary Guards entered their house
    and expropriated his belongings as well as documents and birth
    certificates of family members. They sealed the doors to the house. They
    arrested two family members who had come to the house and took them to
    Arsenjan. They forced the family members to promise that the latter would
    not return to Qasrodasht Kamin. Mr. Zarghami Baseri s body was left on the
    ground until the afternoon when state agents transferred it to the local
    medical center. The interviewee says that she saw her father s vehicle was
    full of bullet-holes. She states that the head of the Revolutionary Guards
    ordered the coroner to identify the cause of death as laceration of the
    heart. Only with much persistence, were family members able to retrieve
    the body from the officials. The family was told to bury the body in their
    house in Shiraz. At the funeral, not only did state agents prevent men
    from attending the ceremony, but they also distributed a leaflet signed by
    the Revolutionary Guards Corps of Arsenjan. In this leaflet, Mr. Zarghami
    Baseri was called a fugitive spy. Some of Mr. Zarghami Baseri s male
    employees wore women s veil ( chador ) in order to attend the funeral. He
    was buried next to his daughter, who had passed when she was 9. State
    agents reportedly had broken her marble gravestone and taken it away. The
    interviewee says that the BBC radio as well as the Voice of Israel
    announced news of her father s assassination. Mr. Zarghami Baseri s
    properties as well as his brother s and son s vehicles were confiscated
    the day of his assassination. Additionally, his wife s properties were
    also temporarily confiscated in 1981. More than one year after his death,
    the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Fars Province gave legitimacy to the
    confiscations. Mr. Zarghami Baseri s assassination and the confiscation on
    his property gave rise to protests of influential local residents and
    disagreements among state officials. Mr. Shahbazi emphasizes that his
    assassination by unknown men was carried out in violation of religious
    principles and without judicial sentence. Ayatollah Montazeri also
    addressed this issue in his Diaries (Los Angeles: Ketab Corp., 2001) where
    he quotes a religious judge saying, some state officials wanted to
    confiscate the Zarghami family s properties but they could not find any
    reason for the confiscation, since they had inherited their property from
    previous generations. In the end, the officials found a Jewish person in
    the family, five generations before. They said that their property could
    be confiscated because of that; but I refused. Nevertheless, their
    property was eventually confiscated. Local state officials emphasized to
    Mr. Zarghami Baseri s wife that higher-ranking officials in Tehran had
    issued the order to confiscate their property. On February 26, 1982, a
    member of the High Judicial Coun
