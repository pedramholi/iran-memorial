    The execution of Haj Moslem Zarqani was reported along with six others by
    the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Sabzevar (August 23,
    1980). Arrest and detention There is no information available on the
    circumstances of Mr. Zarqani s arrest and detention in this report. Trial
    The report provided no information on Mr. Zamandi s trial. Charges Based
    on the report, the defendant was charged with drug trafficking. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report indicated that the defendant had twenty one kilograms and six
    hundred grams of opium and nine kilograms and three hundred grams of opium
    sap in his possession at the time of his arrest. Defense No information on
    the accused s defense is available. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Sabzevar sentenced Mr. Zarqandi to death. He was executed at
    dawn, three days after his trial.
