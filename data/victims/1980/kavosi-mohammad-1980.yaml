    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Kavosi was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily (July 16, 1980) The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Kavosi’s trial. Charges Based on
    the report, Mr. Kavosi was charged with “several armed robberies in the
    Kalat and Dargaz regions” and “having various criminal records.” Evidence
    of guilt The report of this execution does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Kavosi’s defense. Judgment Based on the
    report, the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashhad sentenced Mr. Kavosi
    to death. He was executed at two in the morning.
