circumstances: >
    The execution of Seyed Ali Fatemipur and another person was reported by
    the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Mashhad (August 4, 1980).
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No specific information about the
    circumstances of the trial was provided. Charges The report mentioned that
    Mr. Fatemipur was charged with carrying two bags of opium, weighing a
    total of 154 kilograms as well as having a past record of carrying 36
    kilograms of opium, for which he had been sentenced to a year in prison
    before the revolution. The defendant is reported to have escaped from
    prison during the revolutionary unrest. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report contains no information regarding the evidence presented against
    the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Fatemipur s
    defense. Judgment The Special Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal for Combating
    Drugs and Narcotics in the East of the Country sentenced Mr. Fatemipur to
    death. He was executed at dawn.
