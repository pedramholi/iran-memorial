circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Hosein Malekinezhad and another individual was
    reported in the Ettela at daily (February 24, 1980). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Based
    on the report, Mr. Malekinezhad s charges were as follows: repeated sodomy
    with adolescents and making them available to his friends as well,
    providing gambling opportunities in his house, selling drugs, and keeping
    illegal arms. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Malekinezhad s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Arak sentenced Mr.
    Malekinezhad to death. He was executed at dawn.
