    The execution of Mr. Hassan Zahmatkesh, son of Musa and a resident of
    Hamedan, along with 9 other individuals was reported by the correspondent
    of Pars New Agency, quoting the religious judge of the Anti-Narcotic
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals. The Jomhuri Eslami newspaper published
    the report on July 24, 1980. Arrest and detention This individual was
    arrested by the Police. No other information is available on his arrest
    and detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges Reportedly, the defendant was largely active in drug trafficking
    in Tehran and throughout the West of the country. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt Based on the report, the
    defendant was arrested with 21 kilograms and 362 grams of heroin. Defense
    No information is available on the defense. Judgment The religious judge
    of the Anti-Narcotic Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Hassan
    Zahmatkesh to death. He was executed early in the morning on Wednesday
    July 23, 1980.
