    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Ashrafi and another person was announced
    in the Peykar publication, number 80, dated November 10, 1980. Further
    information was published in the Peykargar (a publication of the Peykargar
    Student Union in West Berlin), number 10, dated March 1, 1987. Mr. Ashrafi
    is one of the 430 “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation
    of the Working Class” who is published on the Andeesheh va Peykar website
    of the Peykar Organization . This list contains the names of those members
    of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400
    of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr. Ashrafi was born
    in Aghajari (in the south-western province of Khuzestan) on September 23,
    1953. He worked for the National Iranian Oil Company and was a Peykar
    sympathizer in Aghajari. He was married and had a child. He was arrested
    twice during the Shah’s time, once for making a film depicting the working
    class of Aghajari, and the second time in relation to a friend’s arrest.
    The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention According to the Peykargar , Mr. Ashrafi
    was arrested on October 21, 1980 during an attack by the regime’s agents
    on the sympathizers of the Peykar Organization. No further information is
    available about his arrest or detention. Trial Mr. Ashrafi was tried in a
    court headed by the cleric Ayatollah Khalkhali without an indictment or
    legal representation ( Peykar ). Charges According to the Andeesheh va
    Peykar website , Mr. Ashrafi was charged with “propaganda and speaking
    against the Iran-Iraq war.” Peykar described the court where Mr. Ashrafi
    and another person were tried. The religious judge asked about his
    ideology and said, “Are you a communist?” The defendants answered in the
    positive. The judge then asked, “If released, will you continue on the
    same path?” The defendants answered in the affirmative once again.
    Evidence of guilt According to the information available, there was no
    evidence against Mr. Ashrafi except for his own statements at the trial.
    The Peykar magazine reported that Mr. Ashrafi asked the judge, “With what
    evidence are you trying us?” The judge replied, “There is no need for
    evidence. Just the fact that you went to Kordestan to fight is enough”
    (referring to fighting between Kordish oppositional groups and the agents
    of the Islamic republic). Defense When the religious judge accused Mr.
    Ashrafi of taking part in the fighting in Kordestan, the latter responded,
    “Although it would have been an honor to fight in Kordestan, we have not
    gone there. You try us merely for our beliefs and love for the working
    class.” Ayatollah Khalkhali asked, “Why does your organization say that
    those internally displaced due to the war are opposed to the war? Did Emam
    [Khomeini] not say that we would fight until victory?” Mr. Ashrafi's
    co-defendant replied that the stance of the Peykar Organization reflected
    the will of the people. Mr. Ashrafi stated in his will, “I am totally
    innocent and there is no evidence against me for which I am being
    executed” (published in the Peykar magazine). Judgment The religious judge
    condemned Mr. Ashrafi to death. He was executed by firing squad in
    Miankuh, near Agahjari, on October 25, 1980. Peykargar states that his
    body was not returned to his family for 24 hours, and then it was returned
    only with the condition that he would not be buried in the city cemetery
    since he was an “apostate and thereby unclean.” His body was buried in a
    village near Omidieh where some of his relatives lived.
