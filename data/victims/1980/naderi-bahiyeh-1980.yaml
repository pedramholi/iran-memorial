    Bahieh Naderi, daughter of Ms. Soraya and Mr. Sheikh Mohammad Ardestani
    (Nateq), was obtained from documents published on the Archives of Baha i
    Persecution in Iran website (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran, July
    3, 2018). Additional information about this case was obtained from an
    interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with Shahin
    Milani, human rights activist and son of a disappeared member of the Baha

    2019, August 23, 1980, October 23, 1980, November 1, 1980). Ms. Naderi was
    born in the city of Kashan in 1918-19, into a Baha i family. She finished
    her primary school education in Kashan s Baha i School, and studied two
    years of high school in Tehran. When all Baha i schools were ordered shut
    down by the government in 1934-35 (Encyclopedia Iranica, August 23, 2021),
    Ms. Naderi was home schooled by a private teacher and was able to obtain
    her high school diploma. At the same time, she enrolled in a training
    program to become a secretary. She was married in 1936-37. Ms. Naderi
    lived with her family in various towns across Iran for many years in order
    to promote the Baha i faith. In 1953-54, she became a member of the Tehran
    Local Spiritual Assembly, and in 1958-59, she was elected to the First
    National Baha i Spiritual Assembly of Iran, where she served for 14 years.
    In 1972-73, Ms. Naderi became a member of the Tehran Local Spiritual
    Assembly for a second time, and in 1979, she was elected to the First

    as Ema-al-rahman (a Baha i prayer) and ethics classes in the town of
    Rafsanjan. At 14, she was teaching at Kashan s Vahdat-e Bashar ( Human
    Unity ) School. Andalib Magazine remembers Ms. Naderi as a great orator
    whose speeches did not contain any exaggerations, and were eloquent,
    resonant, and strong. Her arguments and sentences were logically linked
    and based on evidence . Ms. Naderi married Mr. Nasrollah Naderi in
    1936-37, and had three children with him. According to Ms. Naderi s
    friends, she not only served the Baha i faith and the Baha i faithful, but
    she was also a loyal and loving wife and a kind and understanding mother
    who raised her children in the best possible way. Andalib Magazine, Year
    Six, Volume 22, Spring 1987, pages 42 to 45, June 28, 2021). The Baha is
    in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background Authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran (the largest minority, with approximately three hundred thousand
    members) to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their
    most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under
    the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to
    it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence. * They have been banned from any activities in the public
    realm, and their political, social, and economic rights are constantly
    violated. Baha is are deprived of the right to education, particularly
    higher education, and are banned from holding jobs in the government or in
    government-affiliated entities. They are not even safe and secure in
    owning private businesses, and in many cases, their places of business
    have either been attacked by individuals and groups affiliated with the
    government or are shut down for refusing to work on religious holy days.
    The Iranian regime arrests Baha is on trumped up charges on a regular
    basis. [3] Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the time of
    the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified and
    institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah
