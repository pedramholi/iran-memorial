    The execution of Mr. Ali Nazar Heidari and two others was announced by the

    Revolutionary Guards [Pasdaran] in an interview with Pars News Agency. The
    Jomhuri Eslami daily published the news (November 24, 1980). Arrest and
    detention The announcement provided no information on the circumstances of
    Mr. Heidari s arrest and detention. Trial No specific information about
    the trial is available. Charges Based on the announcement, Mr. Heidari was
    charged with participation in an altercation that resulted in the murder
    of six individuals four months ago in the village of Jujeh Heidar. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on the
    evidence presented against the defendant. Defense The report provided no
    information about the defendant s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Boroujerd sentenced Mr. Heidari to death and the
    verdict was confirmed by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center
    (Tehran). He was executed at 11:20 a.m. on Monday.
