circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Nokhas Bavandpur and another individual was reported
    by the correspondents of the Jomhuri Eslami, Enqelab Eslami, and Kayhan
    dailies in Kermanshah (July 5, 1980). The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this individual’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Based on the Enqelab Eslami report, the defendant was tried at the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kermanshah. Charges Mr. Bavandpur was
    charged with “armed robbery” and “murdering Mashaallah Lotfi.” Evidence of
    guilt The reports contain no information regarding the evidence presented
    against the defendant at the trial. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant’s defense. Judgment Mr. Bavandpur was sentenced to death.
    Based on the Kayhan report, he was executed at 10:45 p.m. in Dolatabad,
    Kermanshah.
