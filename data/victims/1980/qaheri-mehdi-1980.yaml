# --- DEATH ---
date_of_death: 1980-07-04
age_at_death: null
place_of_death: "Najaf Abad"
province: "Esfahan"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mehdi Qaheri and two others was announced to Pars
    News Agency by the public relations office of the Revolutionary Guards
    headquarters of Isfahan. The Jomhuri Eslami and Enqelab Eslami dailies
    published the announcement (July 5, 1980). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Based on the reports, the verdict was issued by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Najaf Abad. However, the circumstances of the
    trial remain unknown. Charges Mr. Qaheri was charged with “repeated sodomy
    and rape at gun point” Evidence of guilt The reports did not provide any
    information regarding the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on the defendant’s defense. Judgment
    Mr. Qaheri and two other defendants were sentenced to death for
    “corruption on earth” and “waging war against God and his prophet.”
