circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Rajabali Mellat and another individual was reported
    in the Ettela at daily (February 9, 1980) The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.

    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashhad. However, the specific
    circumstances of the trial remain unknown. Charges Based on the report,
    Mr. Mellat was charged with the intentional and premeditated murder of
    Karbalayi Hosein Golmakani. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    available on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense The
    report provided no information about the accused s defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashhad declared Mr. Mellat a "corruptor
    on earth and he was sentenced to death.
