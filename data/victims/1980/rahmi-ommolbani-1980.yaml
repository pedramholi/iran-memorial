circumstances: >
    The execution of Ms. Ommolbani Rahmi (known as Sediqeh) and another
    individual was reported by the correspondent of the Ettela at daily in
    Arak (February 24, 1980). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Based
    on the report, Ms. Rahmi was charged with the ugly act of adultery through
    the years and seducing/procuring other married women. Evidence of guilt
    There is no mention of any evidence presented against the defendant.
    However, the report refers to Ms. Omolnabi s confession and admission of
    guilt in court as the basis of her conviction. Defense No information is
    available on Ms. Rahmi s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Arak sentenced Ms. Rahmi to death. She was executed at dawn.
