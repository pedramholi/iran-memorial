    Trial The report mentioned that examining Mr. Abdizadeh s and the other

    Tribunal of Dezful. Charges Based on the report, Mr. Abdizadeh was charged

    with his like-minded friends by using threats to force them into sodomy.

    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on the
    evidence presented against the victim. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Abdizadeh s defense. Judgment According to the report, Mr.
    Abdizadeh was found guilty of corruption on earth. The death sentence was
    carried out at 9:30 p.m March 19, 1980.
