    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and

    several hours. Charges The defendant was charged with distributing drugs.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Kerman declared Mr. Naruyi a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to
    death. The sentence was carried out at 11 p.m., shortly after its
    issuance.
