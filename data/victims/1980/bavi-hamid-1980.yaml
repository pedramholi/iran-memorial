place_of_death: "Ahvaz"
province: "Khuzestan"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Hamid Bavi was announced in a communiqu of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Khuzestan in Ahvaz published in the
    Jomhuri Eslami daily (June 10, 1980). Arrest and detention The communiqu
    as published by the Jomhuri Eslami daily shows the date of the alleged
    crime by the defendant (July 17, 1980) to be 37 days after the date
    mentioned for his execution (June 10, 1980). Therefore, it is not clear
    what the actual dates of the alleged crime and the consequent arrest were.
    The communiqu claims that Mr. Bavi was detained only after his own clear
    confession to murder. However, while further investigations were being
    made during his detention, he started to pretend that he was insane in
    order to escape the penalty. He did such strange things as eating frogs
    and meat, which prompted the court to have three medical specialists
    examine him for insanity. Trial No information is available about Mr. Bavi
    s trial. Charges According to the communiqu , Mr. Bavi was charged with
    martyring the Revolutionary Guard Iraj Sabzevari. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The communiqu mentions
    that the charge was confirmed based on the medical specialists clear
    opinion about the mental conditions of the defendant and other contents of
    his file. However, no specific information regarding the circumstances of
    obtaining the confessions and the nature of the contents of the file is
    provided. Defense No information is available on Mr. Bavi s defense.
    Judgment According to the communiqu , Mr. Bavi was sentenced to death
    based on Qisas [the law of talion ]. He was executed at dawn.
