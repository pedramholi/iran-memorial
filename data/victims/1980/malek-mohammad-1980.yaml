    The execution of Brigadier General Mohammad Malek was reported along with
    4 others in the Jomhuri Eslami and Enqelab Eslami dailies (July 20, 1980).
    Brig. Gen. Malek was reportedly involved in planning a coup d tat, known
    as Noje, which was never carried out. On July 7, 1980, the Islamic
    Republic of Iran authorities announced the discovery and dismantling of a
    civil and military network which had planned a coup d tat to overthrow the
    regime. Following this discovery, more than sixty officers and civilians
    were executed in several cities of Iran in less than a month. Most of the
    officers were still active in the army and had not been removed in the
    first wave of purges which took place within the file and ranks of the
    army after the fall of the monarchy. Two months later, the organization
    NEGHAB in a communiqu , claimed responsibility for this attempted
    uprising. The organization attested that the path of Mossadegh is that of
    the people and today Bakhtiar is its authentic leader. We have risen up to
    put an end to this curse (the Islamic regime) and to entrust the affairs
    of our land to the faithful disciple of Mossadegh Shapour Bakhtiar. (Iran:
    In Defense of Human Rights, National Movement of the Iranian Resistance,
    Paris, 1983) Nureddin Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh Party (the
    Iranian pro-Soviet communist party) mentions the coup d tat in an article
    dated May 2, 2000 (www.rahetudeh.com). Kianuri stresses the fact that the
    military branch of the Tudeh , which cooperated with the Islamic
    Republic's authorities, discovered and "neutralized" the above mentioned
    organization as well as other groups that planned a coup against the newly
    established regime. Arrest and detention No information is available on
    the circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention. Trial Based on
    the report, the trial was held from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of the Army in the Evin Prison. The deliberation
    amongst religious judges lasted an hour. Charges No charges were specified
    for Brig. Gen. Malek individually. Collectively, he and three other
    defendants were charged with plotting and participation in a coup d tat to
    be carried out on Thursday night on July 9, 1980, against the Islamic
    Republic of Iran and being rebels against the sovereignty of Islam. The
    prosecutor referred to the defendants as enthusiasts of the Shah s rotten,
    filthy, and reactionary regime and supporters of blood-thirsty American
    imperialism. He further explained that the defendants had in mind to bring
    the American social democracy as a gift to the liberated people of Iran.
    They had in mind to re-assess the opinion of our heroic nation about the
    return of the royal system through a referendum [ ]. Evidence of guilt
    Based on the indictment, the evidences used against the defendants were as
    follows: 1) The defendants clear confessions regarding: a) having designed
    and having had the intension of carrying out a coup d tat against the
    sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran; b) having prepared 35-50
    aircrafts for their operation and for bombing various busy parts of the
    cities; c) having intended to return the treacherous Bakhtiar to power in
    case their plan succeeded; d) having prepared printed leaflets to
    distribute among people and threaten to suppress any resistance in case
    their plan succeeded; e) having planned to take over military centers such
    as Mehrabad Airport and the Radio and Television Office. 2) Reports
    attached to the defendants files by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards 3)
    Statements of each defendant about the other defendants 4) Existence of
    certain indications and references in their files Defense No information
    is available on Brig. Gen. Malek s defense. Judgment The indictment ends
    with the following necessary explanation: This conspiracy is not a single
    incident and these conspirators cannot be considered ordinary convicts.
    These are criminals who have undermined the newly-found truth, honor, and
    dignity of a liberated Umma [community of Muslim people]. Considering that
    and by consulting the holy verses of the Koran regarding the punishment of
    the rebel against the Islamic sovereign, it is imperative that the
    convicts receive their punishment according to Shari'a law. Brig. Gen.
    Malek was sentenced to death. At midnight, within hours after the issuance
    of the verdict, the defendant was executed at the same place where he was
    tried.
