    Mr. Gholamreza Shafi i s name appeared in a list of 21 executed
    individuals, reported by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals of Tehran and
    Hamedan and published the Jomhuri Eslami daily (June 7, 1980). Arrest and
    detention The report provided no information regarding the circumstances
    of Mr. Shafi i s arrest and detention. Trial The Jomhuri Eslami report
    mentioned that Mr. Shafi i was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    of Hamedan, presided by the religious judge. No specific information was
    provided regarding his trial. Charges Based on the report, Mr. Shafi i was
    charged with carrying, buying, and selling drugs and having several
    criminal records in this area. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report did not
    contain any information regarding the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available on Mr. Shafii s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Shafi i was sentenced to death and confiscation of all his
    belongings. The death sentence was carried out within moments after the
    issuance of the verdict.
