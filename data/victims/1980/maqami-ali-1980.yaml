circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ali Maqami was reported by the correspondent of the
    Jomhuri Eslami daily in Qazvin (July 21, 1980). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Maqami s trial. Charges According
    to the report, Mr. Maqami was charged with the following: consistent
    sodomy, drinking, corruption, extramarital sexual relationships, and using
    drugs; acts for which he had become famous in town. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report does not contain any information about the evidence presented
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the
    defendant s defense. Judgment Mr. Maqami was sentenced to death and
    executed.
