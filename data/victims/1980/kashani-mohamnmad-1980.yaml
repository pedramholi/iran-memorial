    Along with that of six other members of the dissident guerilla movement,
    Forqan, Mr. Mohammad Kashani s execution was announced by the public
    relations office of the Chief Revolutionary Public Prosecutor. The
    announcement was published in the Ettela at daily (March 3, 1980) Forqan
    was formed in 1977 by a group of Ali Shari ati s followers with a modern
    interpretation of the Qoran and Islamic ideology. It is not clear whether
    or not the group was armed, but it went underground soon after its
    formation. Based on documents available in the archives of the Islamic
    Revolution Documentation Center (gathered and reported by Ahmad Gudarzi on
    Bacheha-ye Ghalam website), this group opposed from the onset of the
    Revolution the involvement of the clergy in the government and the
    particular interpretation of Islam later implemented by the Islamic
    Republic authorities. In its short period of post-revolutionary activity,
    the group was accused of involvement in several assassinations and armed
    robberies, the first one reportedly as early as May 1979, only a couple of
    months after the triumph of the Revolution. Based on the above mentioned
    report, most of the known members of the group were executed or killed in
    clashes with Islamic Revolutionary Committee forces, which led to the
    total elimination of the group in January 1980. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The announcement specified that the verdict was issued by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center (Tehran); however, no
    information regarding the circumstances of the trial was provided. Charges

    and Martyr Asghar Ne mati, and attempting to assassinate Hojatoleslam
    Rafsanjani as well as armed robbery from the Islamic Republic s banks.
    Evidence of guilt The announcement did not contain any information
    regarding the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on the accused s defense. Judgment Mr. Kashani
    was sentenced to death. The sentence was carried out at 1 a.m. in the Evin
