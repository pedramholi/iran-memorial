circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Reza Zare i and two others was reported by the
    correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Hamedan (August 4, 1980).
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Zare i s
    trial. Charges According to the report, Mr. Zare i was charged with buying
    and selling heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report
    contains no information regarding the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Zare i s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Hamedan declared Mr. Zare i
    a corruptor on earth. He was executed at dawn.
