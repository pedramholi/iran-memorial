    at Tehran s Misaghieh Hospital. News of his and the Hospital s special
    services and humanitarian efforts had been published in several

    report, in 1978-79, he retired from the military after 32 years, with the

    main reason why her father contented himself with the rank of colonel was
    that Dr. Ayadi, the Shah s physician, had told her father that he wanted
    to present him to the Shah as his successor, but that the Shah s doctor
    had to have the rank of brigadier-general Since her father was not
    interested, he retired with the rank of colonel so that he would not have
    to accept the position of Physician to the Royal Court . (Iran Wire,
