circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Esmail Keshavarz was reported by Pars News Agency
    from Shiraz. The Jomhuri Eslami daily published the report (August 17,
    1980). Arrest and detention No information is available on the
    circumstances of Mr. Keshavarz s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information about the trial is provided by the report. Charges The
    defendant was charged with adultery. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentenced to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report does
    not provide any information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information on the accused s defense is available.
    Judgment The Special Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal declared Mr.
    Kheshavarz a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. He was
    executed at dawn.
