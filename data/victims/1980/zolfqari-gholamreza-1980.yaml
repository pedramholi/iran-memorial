    The execution of Mr. Gholamreza Zolfaqari and 4 others was announced to

    in charge of the Campaign against Drugs and Narcotics. The report was

    detention There is no information available on Mr. Zolfaqari s arrest and
    detention in this report. Trial The report provides no specific
    information about the trial. Charges The defendant, born in Damghan and
    resident of Tehran, was charged with being number one heroin seller who
    has been very active in deceiving adolescents, fraud, and illegal currency
    transfer abroad. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report indicated that the defendant was
    arrested with some heroin on him. Defense No information on the accused s
    defense is available. Judgment The religious judge at the head of the
    Special Revolutionary Tribunals and the Campaign against Drugs and
    Narcotics sentenced Mr. Zolfaqari to death. He was executed at dawn the
    day after his trial.
