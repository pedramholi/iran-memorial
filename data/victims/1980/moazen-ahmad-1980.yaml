    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad Mo azen was published in the Peykar
    publication, number 53 on May 5, 1980. According to this report, he was
    born to a middle class and traditional family in Dezful in 1954. He
    entered Ahvaz University with the highest score in 1974 and graduated an
    Agriculture major. He was a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. News
    of the execution of Mr. Ahmad Mo azen was published in the book "Az Armani
    ke Mijushad" by the sympathizers of the Peykar Organization in August of
    1985. Also a letter from Mr. Ahmad Mo azen was published. Mr. Ahmad Mo
    azen is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of
    Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the
    names of those members of the organization who died after the revolution
    of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed.
    The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention According to the Peykar publication, Mr.
    Ahmad Mo azen was arrested in a street in Ahvaz a day after the regime
    attacked all universities during the so called Cultural Revolution. The
    Cultural Revolution began after Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech in March
    1980 and ordered that universities be purged of all those who opposed his
    regime and be transformed into learning environments [as opposed to
    political forums] where an all-Islamic curriculum would be taught. The
    first wave of violence began on April 15, 1980 during a speech by Akbar
    Hashemi Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and
    Minister of Interior] at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech,
    students supporting the regime took control of the University s central
    building and demanded that the university be purged from pro-Shah elements
    and other sellouts. On April 18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution
    issued a communiqu accusing political groups of converting higher
    education institutions into headquarters of discordant political
    activities and naming them as obstacles to the radical transformation of
    the universities. The communiqu gave these groups three days (Saturday
    April 19 to Monday April 21) to shut down their activities in the
    universities. The Council stressed that the decision included libraries
    along with activities related to arts and sports. Political groups, which
    recruited members and had strong support in the universities, refused to
    evacuate. Before the Council s deadline, serious clashes took place
    between leftist groups and Islamist Associations, which were at times
    supported by security forces and paramilitary groups. These clashes, which
    peaked at the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in the death of
    several people and the wounding of hundreds of others on university
    campuses around the country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic authorities
    announced the victory of the Cultural Revolution and the closure of all
    universities in order to Islamicize the curricula. The universities
    remained closed for two years. One of the outcomes of the Cultural
    Revolution was the purging of many university professors and students
    based on their political beliefs. In his letter, Mr. Ahmad Mo azen
    confirmed his arrest in the street. According to this letter, the
    officials performed several show-executions to torture him. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. In his letter, Mr.
    Ahmad Mo azen wrote that he had been interrogated several times. Charges
    According to the website of Andeesheh va Peykar, the charge against Mr.
    Ahmad Mo azen was announced as, propaganda against the Cultural Revolution
    during the regime s attack on the universities. In his letter, Mr. Ahmad
    Mo azen wrote that he had not committed any crime. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ahmad Mo azen's defense. Judgment According to the list
