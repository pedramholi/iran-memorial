    robbery through creating terror and harassment and inhuman acts as well as
    sexually assaulting a married woman. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of

    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against their
