# --- DEATH ---
date_of_death: 1980-01-12
age_at_death: null
place_of_death: "Ahvaz"
province: "Khuzestan"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Mas udi and two others was reported by the
    correspondent of Pars News Agency in Ahvaz. The report, which quoted the
    spokesperson of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Khuzestan, was
    published in the Ettela at daily (January 12, 1980). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    report reads as follows: The defendant and two other individuals led a
    group spread corruption among young people and, in addition to having
    illegitimate and homosexual relationships, bought, sold, and exchanged
    young boys for their filthy purposes. Evidence of guilt The report did not
    contain any information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mas udi s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Khuzestan declared Mr. Mas
    udi a corruptor on earth and he was subsequently executed.
