circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mahmud Asef Agah (Ashkevari) was reported by the
    correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Qazvin (July 21, 1980).
    According to Jomhuri Eslami daily (July 22, 1980), the victim's relatives
    expressed their objection to the ruling of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Qazvin with an emotional and outraged tone. They asserted that
    Mr. Mahmud Asef Agah had been suffering from mental illnesses and did not
    enjoy access to mental and psychological healthcare; therefore a death
    sentence must not have been carried out in his case. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Asef Agah s trial. Charges
    According to the report, Mr. Asef Agah was charged with being sodomized
    and being famous for it in the town. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report does
    not contain any information about the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Asef Agah was found guilty of corruption on earth. He was
    sentenced to death and executed.
