circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Tabasi and four others was reported by the
    correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Sabzevar (July 13, 1980).
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Based on the report, the Islamic
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor examined the case at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Sabzevar on July 10, 1980. Charges The defendant
    was charged with having a long history in buying and selling opium and
    collaboration with gendarmerie officials on the Arba in day [Islamic holy
    day] 1979, resulting in the martyrdom of five individuals. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Tabasi s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sabzevar sentenced
    Mr. Tabasi to death and confiscation of his belongings. The death sentence
    was carried out the day after the trial.
