    The execution of Mr. Naser Zolqadr and 15 others was reported by the
    correspondents of the Jomhuri Eslami and Kayhan dailies in Shiraz (July 5,
    1980). According to the Shiraz correspondent of the Enqelab Eslami daily
    of the same date, the religious judge who had attended the Friday Sermon
    in Shiraz spoke before performing the prayer while announcing the news:
    “As I was busy examining the cases of drug dealers, the President asked me
    in a telephone conversation to examine the cases of first rate criminals
    with political charges and issue the verdict based on the Shari’a law. I
    requested that the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor of Shiraz give us what
    they have at the Revolutionary Tribunal. Unfortunately, these cases were
    not passed on to us, and therefore I sentenced five people to death based
    on what was available at the prison or the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
    headquarters, and considering the testimonies of witnesses and unbiased
    individuals. One or two of these five people were already tried at the
    court and sentenced to life imprisonment, but I sentenced them to death,
    considering the crimes they had committed; and I did not think it was even
    that necessary to examine their cases, anyway. The death sentence was
    carried out today at dawn, and this was my Islamic and human duty and I
    have done my job in accordance with Shari’a standards.” The report of the
    Friday Sermon speech points to the fact that these executions caused
    disagreement among the clerics. In response to his critic, the religious
    judge said: “The gentleman who has been silent so far and has not shown
    the slightest reaction to the blood of our martyrs, has telephoned certain
    people last night, telling them that I have acted illegally. It must be
    said to him that it is none of his business. It would only be fair if I
    performed my duty to defrock this pseudo-cleric so that other
    pseudo-clerics do not dare present themselves against the Islamic nature
    of Iran.” Arrest and detention The circumstances of this individual’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Based on the Jomhuri Eslami
    report, the religious judge traveled to Shiraz and, after visiting the
    Revolutionary Guard (Pasdaran) headquarters of Shiraz, headed for the
    Shiraz Tribunal, where he examined the cases of sixteen individuals
    charged with a range of crimes from killing and suppression of
    revolutionary combatants to drug dealing and sodomy. Mr. Zolqadr, who was
    previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Shiraz, was one of the defendants re-tired at this special
    court by the religious judge. Charges The Jomhuri Eslami report specified
    the defendant’s charges as “being a torturer and the key person in
    arresting Ayatollah Dastgheyb and Ayatollah Mahallati’s in 1964.” However,
    the Kayhan report mentioned “arresting the combatant youth, torturing
    them, and so forth.” Evidence of guilt The reports contain no information
    regarding the evidence presented against the defendant at the trial.
    Defense No information is available on the defendant’s defense. Judgment
    Based on the Kayhan report, the defendant, previously sentenced to life
    imprisonment by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz, was declared
    a “corruptor on earth” and sentenced to death at this special tribunal
    headed by the religious judge. The sentence was carried out immediately.
    The Jomhuri Eslami report specifies that the sentence included
    confiscation of property for six of the accused. It is not clear whether
    or not Mr. Zolqadr’s properties were confiscated.
