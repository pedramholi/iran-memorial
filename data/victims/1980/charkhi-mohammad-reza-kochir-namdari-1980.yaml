    Though his talents and abilities were buried under the weight of poverty
    and deprivation, there was a glow of confidence and hope behind his
    unassuming face. Information regarding the execution of Mohammad Reza
    (Kochir) Namdari, known as Charkhi, son of Ali Baba, along with three
    others, as well as the arbitrary execution of five others in the street,
    was gathered from two interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center (ABC). One interview was with a participant in the Andimeshk
    protest of March 1980 (April 15, 2024), and the other was with a political
    activist of the time (April 13, 2024), as well as a statement by
    Khomeini's representative published in Bamdad newspaper on March 30, 1980,
    quoting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of Dezful, and
    announcements by the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Dezful, reported in
    Jomhouri Eslami newspaper (July 27, 1980) and Kayhan newspaper (July 25,
    1980). Additional information was also taken from the IRGC's publicity in
    the Jomhouri Eslami, Ettela'at, and Enqelab-e Eslami newspapers (March 17,
    1980); Peykar Magazine, the publication of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class (April 1 and 15, May 5, and September 29,
    1980); Andisheh va Peykar (September 2023); Kar, the publication of the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization Minority; and several websites, including
    Jahan-e Novin (March 1980), Akhbar-e Rooz (by Mokhtar Shalalvand, June 4,
    2012), Nedaye Azadi (by Fariba Marzban, September 27, 2013), and Pezhvak-e
    Iran (by Iraj Mesdaghi and Musa Hatamian, August 9, 2017). Mr. Namdari was
    born into a poor family in a mountain village in Aligudarz. After his
    father died, he was taken in by his aunt and her blind son, with whom he
    lived. His new family later moved to Andimeshk, where they eventually
    settled. He never learned to read or write. As a child in Andimeshk, he
    was sent to a local bicycle repair shop to learn a skill and earn a
    living. "Every day, from dawn to dusk, he spent his time in that small
    workshop near the Taj Cinema, moving among wrenches, brushes, and grease,
    growing up among the tools of his profession." (Pezhvak-e Iran - Mokhtar
    Shalalvand). In Andimeshk he was officially registered at the civil
    registry office, where he received the surname Namdari. Because of his
    work, he never had the opportunity to attend school. However, "you could
    always see a sense of contentment on his face". He was passionate about
    sports, especially soccer, and was a devoted fan of Persepolis. He was
    described as "strongly built, of short stature, with large, bright eyes.
    Although his talents and abilities were buried under the weight of poverty
    and deprivation, there was a glow of confidence and hope behind his
    unassuming face." After several years, Mr. Namdari set up his own workshop
    and started a family. His case was related to the protests in Andimeshk in
    early 1980. 1980 Andimeshk Protest Less than a year after the 1979
    revolution, an atmosphere of hope emerged among young people seeking
    justice and social rights. During this period, there were numerous
    protests in cities such as Tehran, Tabriz, Mahabad, Sari, Amol, Shiraz,
    Isfahan, Ilam, Gonbad Kavus, Rasht and Abadan, where demonstrators
    demanded jobs and economic rights. Unemployed youth in various regions
    sought to organize their employment-related issues by forming independent
    associations or unions, free from political affiliations. In Tabriz, for
    example, the " Graduate and Post-Graduate Union" was formed, which
    successfully held meetings with provincial authorities and received
    official recognition from the provincial government, allowing it to pursue
    its goals. Similar organizations in other cities, however, faced harsh
    repression. In one notable incident, one person was killed and four others
    were injured during a crackdown on protests by unemployed workers in
    Isfahan. Unemployed workers' associations in Dorud and Andimeshk were also
    violently repressed. At the time, Andimeshk's population had increased due
    to an influx of migrants and wartime displacement, exacerbating social
    problems in the area. The Independent Union of the Unemployed in
    Andimeshk* was founded after the 1979 revolution with a focus on workers'
    rights. It aimed to defend the right to work and to protest "appointed
    hiring practices in state institutions and the interference of Islamic
    associations in employment decisions. Early on, union representatives
    negotiated with the mayor, who gave them a room in the city hall. This
    space became their official headquarters and helped them organize their
    efforts more effectively. Union members gathered there daily to hold
    meetings and send letters to Andimeshk authorities demanding jobs for the
    city's unemployed. Despite no official response, the union's activities,
    such as distributing flyers and organizing protests, gained strong support
    from young people. Between 3,000 and 4,000 unemployed youth joined the
    union, paying a small membership fee. Despite the mayor's in
