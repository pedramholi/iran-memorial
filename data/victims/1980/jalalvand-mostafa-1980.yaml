circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mostafa Jalalvand and two others was announced by the
    assistant of the public prosecutor of Hamedan. This announcement was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami, Enqelab Eslami, and Kayhan dailies (July
    5, 1980). The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this individual’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Jalalvand’s trial. Charges Based on the reports, Mr. Jalalvand was
    charged with “having a criminal history of buying and selling heroin” as
    well as “repeated robberies and sedition and destruction.” Evidence of
    guilt The reports contain no information regarding the evidence presented
    against the defendant at the trial. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant’s defense. Judgment The assistant of the public prosecutor
    announced that Mr. Jalalvand was declared a “corruptor on earth” and that
    he was executed at dawn on a Wednesday.
