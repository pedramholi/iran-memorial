    The execution of Mr. Azizollah Taherkhani and another individual was
    reported by the correspondent of Jomhuri Eslami daily in Qazvin (June 24,
    1980) Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial The report mentioned that Mr.
    Taherkhani s case was examined at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal for
    Combatting Drugs and Narcotics located at Qasr Prison. However, no
    specific information about the circumstances of the trial was provided.
    Charges Based on this report, Mr. Taherkhani was charged with having
    frequent criminal records in distributing drugs. However, another report
    in the Ettela at daily (June 24, 1980) listed the defendant s charges as
    participation in armed demonstrations and showing off his power with a
    dagger. The validity of the criminal charges brought against defendants
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the accused s defense. Judgment Based on the report, Mr.
    Taherkhani was sentenced to death. He was executed at dawn.
