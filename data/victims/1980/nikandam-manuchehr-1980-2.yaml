    Mr. Manuchehr Nikandam is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on
    the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. His execution was also reported in the Peykar magazine
    (November 10, 1980) and the Paykargar magazine (March 1987). Mr. Nikandam
    was born in 1956 in Aghajari in the south-western province of Khuzestan.
    He was a teacher, a husband, and a father of two. He was in charge of the
    Peykar Organization s activities in Aghajari. His will, dated one day
    prior to his execution has been published in Peykargar . The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third Line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state, believed that China
    had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed
    all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Nikandam was arrested on October 21, 1980 when the regime s agents
    attacked sympathizers of the Peykar Organization during the flooding in
    Kuzestan. Trial According to the Peykar publication, Mr. Nikandam was
    tried in a court headed by Ayatollah Khalkhali without an indictment or a
    defense attorney. Charges According to the Andeesheh va Peykar website,
    Mr. Nikandam was charged with propaganda and speaking against the
    Iran-Iraq War. Peykar describes the court where Mr. Nikandam and another
    person were tried. The religious judge asked about his ideology and said,
    Are you a communist? The defendants answered in the positive. The judge
    then asked, If released, will you continue on the same path? The
    defendants answered in the affirmative once again. Evidence of guilt
    According to the information available, there was no evidence against Mr.
    Nikandam except for his own statements at the trial. The Peykar magazine
    reports that his co-defendant, Mr. Mohammad Ali Ashrafi asked the judge,
    With what evidence are you trying us? The judge replied, There is no need
    for evidence. Just the fact that you went to Kordestan to fight is enough
    (referring to fighting between Kurdish oppositional groups and the agents
    of the Islamic republic). Defense When the religious judge accused Mr.
    Nikandam and his co-defendant of taking part in the fighting in Kordestan,
    the latter responded, Although it would have been an honor to fight in
    Kordestan, we have not gone there. You try us merely for our beliefs and
    love for the working class. Ayatollah Khalkhali asked, Why does your
    organization say that those internally displaced due to the war are
    opposed to the war? Did Emam [Khomeini] not say that we would fight until
    victory? Mr. Nikandam replied that the stance of the Peykar Organization
    reflected the will of the people. Judgment Mr. Nikandam was executed by
    firing squad in Aghajari on October 25, 1980. In his will, dated October
    24, 1980, Mr. Nikandam wrote: Fati, my dear wife, Behrang my son, Sharareh
    my daughter, you were shining starts of my life My beloved wife, do not
    worry too much; raise our children regardless of the problems and tell
    them how their father was killed. Try to be courageous in life, as
    courageous as you were at the time of farewell My last word is that I do
    not want you to suffer thinking about me. I m sure you will find your way,
    just as you have in the past. Whichever path you choose in your life, I
    know you will live honorably.
