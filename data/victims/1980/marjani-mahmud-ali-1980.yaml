    Mr. Mahmud Ali Marjani s name appeared in a list of 21 executed
    individuals, reported by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals of Tehran and
    Hamedan and published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (June 7, 1980). Arrest
    and detention The report provided no information regarding the
    circumstances of Mr. Marjani s arrest and detention. Trial The Jomhuri
    Eslami report mentioned that Mr. Marjani was tried in Tehran by the
    religious judge who was also the head of the Campaign against Drugs and
    Narcotics. No specific information was provided regarding his trial.
    Charges Based on the report, Mr. Marjani was charged with establishing a
    tavern, a House of Pleasure, an opium den, and a gambling place, selling
    drugs, and sexually abusing his own daughter. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report did not
    contain any information regarding the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available on Mr. Marjani s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Marjani was found guilty of corruption on earth and waging
    war against God. The death sentence was carried out within moments after
    the issuance of the verdict.
