    News of the execution of Mr. Mojtaba Moradi and 10 others was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 31, 1980. He was reportedly involved in
    planning a coup d tat, known as Nojeh, which was aborted the day it was
    launched. Information about Mr. Mojtaba Moradi, son of Ebrahim, is based
    on an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person
    familiar with his case. Additional information has been drawn from the
    indictment of four other individuals who were also involved in the Nojeh
    coup, as published in the Jomhuri Eslami and Enqelab Esmali newspapers on
    July 20, 1980. According to the existing information, Mr. Moradi was
    married with two children and was a parachutist of Nohed Brigade 23 of the
    Army. According to available information, the planners of the Nojeh coup
    were members of the armed forces and the Iran Party (social democrat and
    part of the Iranian National Front), who opposed the religious rule and
    believed in the separation of church and state. The core of the coup d tat
    was to fly aircrafts from the Nojeh base in Hamedan and bomb some military
    targets as well as the residence of Ayatollah Khomeini. Another team was
    to take over the radio-television building inTehranin order to announce
    the coup and expose the motives to the population. A group of Bakhtiari
    nomads also participated in this coup. The plan was discovered a few hours
    before being carried out. On July 9, 1980, the Islamic Republic of Iran
    authorities announced the discovery and dismantling of a civil and
    military network which had planned the coup d tat to overthrow the regime.
    Two months later, the organization Neqab, in a communiqu , claimed
    responsibility for this attempted uprising. The organization attested that
    the path of Mossadegh is that of the people and, today, Bakhtiar is its
    authentic leader We have risen up to put an end to this curse [the Islamic
    regime] and to entrust the affairs of our land to the faithful disciple of
    Mossadegh Shapur Bakhtiar. (Iran: In Defense of Human Rights, National
    Movement of the Iranian Resistance, Paris, 1983). Following the discovery
    of the plan for the coup, more than sixty officers and civilians were
    executed in several cities of Iran in less than a month. Most of the
    officers were still active in the army and had not been swept away in the
    first wave of purges which took place in the army after the fall of the
    monarchy. Executions of individuals involved in the Nojeh coup continued
    in the months and years to come; at least 200 persons were executed in
    relations to the coup. Nureddin Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh
    Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet communist party) mentioned the coup d tat in
    an article dated May 2, 2000 posted on the Rah-e Tudeh website. Kianuri
    stressed the fact that the military branch of the Tudeh Party, which
    cooperated with the Islamic Republic s authorities, discovered and
    neutralized the coup. Arrest and detention According to the information
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation, he was arrested in Tehran during office
    hours, and marks of torture were evident after his arrest. No explanation
    was provided regarding this claim. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Moradi s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Moradi s
    charges. In an indictment dated July 19, 1980, the Public Prosecutor said
    the following regarding some other participants of this alleged coup d tat
    plan: These enthusiasts of the Shah s rotten, filthy, and reactionary
    regime, these supporters of the blood-thirsty American imperialism, [had
    in mind to] bring about American social democracy and after two years of
    curfew and absolute oppression, put the monarchial system on referendum
    The Public Prosecutor emphasized: This conspiracy was not planned in a
    vacuum and hence cannot be described in a single indictment; and these
    conspirators cannot be considered ordinary convicts. They are criminals
    who have undermined the newly regained truth, honor, and dignity of a
    liberated community of Muslim people. Considering this, and consulting
    verses of the holy Quran regarding the punishment of a rebel against the
    Islamic sovereign, it is imperative that the convicts receive their
    punishment according to the Shari a law. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available about Mr. Moradi s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of the Army sentenced Mr. Mojtaba Moradi to death. According to
    the existing information, Mr. Moradi was executed by firing squad at the
    Evin prison yard in Tehran on July 31, 1980 at dawn. He was buried at the
    Behesht-e Zahra cemetery.
