    The information about Mr. Sirus Sotudeh is based on an interview with a
    person close to him. Mr. Sirus Sotudeh was an army colonel. He was married
    and had two daughters and a son. He was a sympathizer of the National
    Resistance Movement founded by Dr. Shapur Bakhtiar after the Revolution.
    Mr. Sotudeh had been arrested, trialed, and executed due to his role in
    the Nojeh coup. On July 11, 1980, the Islamic Republic of Iran authorities
    announced the discovering and dismantling of a civil and military network
    which had planned a coup d tat (known as the Nojeh coup) to overthrow the
    regime. Following this discovery, more than sixty officers and civilians
    were executed in several cities of Iran in less than a month. Most of the
    officers were still active in the army and had not been swept away in the
    first wave of purges which took place in the army after the fall of the
    monarchy. Two months later, the organization Neqab, in a communiqu ,
    claimed responsibility for this attempted uprising. Neqab attested that
    the path of Mossadeq is that of the people and today Bakhtiar is its
    authentic leader. The communiqu stated: We have risen up to put an end to
    this curse (the Islamic regime) and to entrust the affairs of our land to
    the faithful disciple of Mossadeq Shapur Bakhtiar (Iran: In Defense of
    Human Rights, National Movement of the Iranian Resistance, Paris, 1983).
    Nureddin Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh Party (the Iranian
    pro-Soviet communist party) mentions the coup d tat in an article dated
    May 2, 2000 (www.rahetudeh.com). Kianuri stresses the fact that the
    military branch of the Tudeh , which cooperated with the Islamic
    Republic's authorities, discovered and neutralized the above mentioned
    organization as well as other groups that planned a coup against the newly
    established regime. Arrest and detention Mr. Sirus Sotudeh was arrested by
    army soldiers at his residence in Ahvaz on July 17, 1979. After one week
    detention in Ahvaz, he was sent to Tehran and one week later he was
    returned to Ahvaz. In his 40 day detention, he was denied the right to
    have an attorney. His only visitation with his wife and new born took
    place a day before his execution. According to one of his cellmates who
    met his family later on, Mr. Sirus Sotudeh was battered severely during
    his detention period. Trial His trial was held in Ahvaz. Part of his trial
    was broadcasted on Ahvaz television. No further detail is known about the
    court session(s). Charges The charge against Mr. Sirus Sotudeh was
    announced as "participation in unsuccessful Nojeh coup." In an indictment
    dated July 19, 1980 (published in Enqelab Eslami and Jomhuri Eslami
    newspapers, July 20, 1980), the Public Prosecutor said the following
    regarding some other participants of this alleged coup d tat plan: These
    enthusiasts of the Shah s rotten, filthy, and reactionary regime, these
    supporters of the blood-thirsty American imperialism had in mind to bring
    American social democracy as a gift to the liberated people of Iran. They
    had in mind to re-asses the opinion of our heroic nation about the return
    of the royal system through a referendum [ ]. He added: This conspiracy is
    not a single incident and these conspirators cannot be considered ordinary
    convicts. These are criminals who have undermined the newly-found truth,
    honor, and dignity of a liberated nation [community of Muslim people].
    Considering that, and consulting the holly verses of the Quran regarding
    the punishment of the rebel against the Islamic sovereign, it is
    imperative that the convicts receive their punishment according to the
    Shari a law. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available about his defense. Judgment Mr. Sirus
    Sotudeh was executed in public by firing squad under a bridge in Ahvaz on
    August 28, 1979.
