    The execution of Mr. Shahryar Vatanpur was reported by the correspondent
    of Pars News Agency in Ahvaz. The report was published in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily (July 26, 1980) Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are unknown. Trial The Court held a
    session at 5 p.m. to examine Mr. Vatanpur s case. Charges According to the
    report, Mr. Vatanpur was charged with stealing a side arm from the Asqafi
    Al-Islami center in Ahvaz and misusing it for blackmailing. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report does not contain any information
    about the evidence presented against the accused. Defense No information
    is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor found Mr. Vatanpur guilty of corruption on
    earth and waging war against God and his prophet. The sentence was carried
    out in late afternoon, immediately after his trial.
