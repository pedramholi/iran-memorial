circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Behruz Rusta, resident of Tabriz, and 4 others was
    announced to Pars News Agency by the head of the Special Revolutionary
    Tribunals, also in charge of the Campaign against Drugs and Narcotics. The
    report was published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (August 20, 1980). Arrest
    and detention There is no information available on Mr. Rusta s arrest and
    detention in this report. Trial The report provides no specific
    information about the trial. Charges The defendant was charged with being
    a number one drug dealer who has been selling heroin in Azarbayejan for
    quite some time and has been arrested for that reason several times
    before. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report indicated that the defendant was
    arrested with one kilogram of opium on him. Defense No information on the
    accused s defense is available. Judgment The religious judge at the head
    of the Special Revolutionary Tribunals and the Campaign against Drugs and
    Narcotics sentenced Mr. Rusta to death. He was executed at dawn the day
    after his trial.
