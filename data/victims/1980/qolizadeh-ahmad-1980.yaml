    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Qolizadeh was announced by the spokesman of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecution Office of Hamedan in a telephone
    conversation with Pars News Agency. The Jomhuri Eslami daily published the
    announcement (July 16, 1980) The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Based on the
    report, the verdict was issued by the religious judge at the Special Court
    for Combating Drugs and Narcotics. Charges The report only referred to Mr.
    Qolizadeh as a professional drug dealer but did not specify any charges
    against him. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Qolizadeh s defense. Judgment
    Based on the report, Mr. Qolizadeh was sentenced to death and executed at
    three in the morning.
