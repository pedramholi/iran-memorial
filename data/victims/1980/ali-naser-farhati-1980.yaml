place_of_death: "Tabriz"
province: "Azarbaijan-e Sharqi"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Naser Farhati 'Ali and 6 others was reported by the
    correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Tabriz (July 15, 1980). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial There is no information available about
    the circumstances of the trial. Charges Based on the report, Mr. Farhati
    'Ali and his co-defendant were charged with “acts incompatible with
    chastity” and “repeated sodomy, so much so that this immoral and filthy
    act had become like a chronic disease with them.” Evidence of guilt The
    report does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Farhati
    'Ali’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz
    declared Mr. Farhati 'Ali a “corruptor on earth” and sentenced him to
    death. He was executed in the evening.
