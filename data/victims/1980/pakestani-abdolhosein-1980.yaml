    The execution of Mr. Abdolhosein Pakestani, known as Kichur, was reported
    by the Jomhuri Eslami daily (August 7, 1980). Arrest and detention No
    information is available on the circumstances of Mr. Pakestani s arrest
    and detention. Trial Mr. Pakestani s case was examined at the Special
    Court for Drugs and Narcotics in Bandar Abbas. This report did not provide
    any specific information about the trial. Charges The report indicated
    that based on the defendant s own clear confessions , Mr. Pakestani was
    found guilty of having connections to the drug cartel of the South and
    smuggling heroin for them through Zahedan, Khash, and Kerman . The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against the defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information on the accuseds
    defense is available. Judgment Mr. Pakestani was sentenced to death. He
