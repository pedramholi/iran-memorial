cause_of_death: "Execution » Shooting"
circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ebrahim Fattahi and two others was reported in the
    Ettela’at daily (February 2, 1980). The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Based
    on the report, Mr. Fattahi was charged with the following: “armed robbery
    from the Kuhpayeh branch of Bank e Melli [National Bank],” “carrying
    Kalashnikov guns illegally,” “shooting in the bank and creating terror,”
    “stealing a Mercedes Benz in Tehran,” “robbery at the Steel Mill
    terminal,” and “buying and selling smuggled goods.” Evidence of guilt The
    report did not provide any information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the
    accused’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Isfahan
    declared Mr. Fattahi a “corruptor on earth” and “an enemy of God and his
    prophet” and sentenced him to death.
