    The execution of Mr. Mashallah Tahnezad (Tanezad) and three others was
    reported by the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Kermanshah
    (July 31, 1980). Additional information about this case was provided to
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center via two electronic forms by persons
    familiar with his case (e-forms November 7, 2017, and April 15, 2021). Mr.
    Tahnezad was born in Kermanshah in 1947/48. He had a middle school
    diploma, was single, and was self-employed. He was the caretaker of his
    mother and sick brother after their father passed away. Arrest and

    related to narcotics and a family dispute with his brother-in-law. He was
    imprisoned at Diselabad-e Kermanshah s prison. Trial The special division
    for combating drugs and narcotics of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Kermanshah tried Mr. Tahnezad. Charges Mr. Tahnezad was charged with drug
    related offences, as well as adultery and attacking the police. ( Jomhuri
    Eslami daily, July 31, 1980) The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against Mr. Tahnezad cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available regarding the evidence of guilt provided against Mr. Tahnezad.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Tahnezad s defense. Judgment
    Mr. Tahnezad was sentenced to death by the special division for combating
    drugs and narcotics of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kermanshah. He
    was executed by a firing squad at 11 a.m. on July 30, 1980, and was buried
    in Ferdos Garden in Kermanshah. After his death, his mother and brother
    lived in poverty. (e-form April 15, 2021)
