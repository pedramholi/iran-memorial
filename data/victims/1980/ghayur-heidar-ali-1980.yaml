# --- DEATH ---
date_of_death: 1980-07-04
age_at_death: null
place_of_death: "Najaf Abad"
province: "Esfahan"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Heidar Ali Ghayur and two others was announced to
    Pars News Agency by the public relations office of the Revolutionary
    Guards (Pasdaran) headquarters of Isfahan. The Jomhuri Eslami and Enqelab
    Eslami dailies published the announcement (July 5, 1980). The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Based on the reports, the verdict was issued by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Najaf Abad. However, the circumstances of the
    trial remain unknown. Charges Mr. Ghayur was charged with “several records
    in sodomy.” Evidence of guilt The reports did not provide any information
    regarding the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on the defendant’s defense. Judgment Mr. Ghayur
    and two other defendants were sentenced to death for “corruption on earth”
    and “waging war against God and his prophet.” According to the
    Revolutionary Guards headquarters, following the executions, the whole
    town of Najaf Abad was closed down and different groups of people
    expressed their support for the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Najaf
    Abad and the Revolutionary Guards by demonstrating and issuing a
    declaration.
