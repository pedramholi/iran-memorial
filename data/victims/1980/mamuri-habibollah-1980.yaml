circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Habibollah Ma muri and five others was reported by
    the correspondent of the Pars News Agency in Mashhad. The report was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (October 18, 1980). Arrest and
    detention The report provided no information on the circumstances of Mr.
    Ma muri s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    circumstances of the trial. Charges The report indicated that Mr. Ma muri
    was charged with being involved with drugs. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There
    is no information available on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense The report provided no information about the defendant
    s defense. Judgment The Eastern Special Court for Drugs and Narcotics in
    Mashhad sentenced Mr. Ma muri to death. He was executed at dawn.
