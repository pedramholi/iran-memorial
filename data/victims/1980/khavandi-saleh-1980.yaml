place_of_death: "Tabriz"
province: "Azarbaijan-e Sharqi"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Saleh Khavandi and five others was reported by the
    correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Tabriz. The newspaper refers
    to him as a "pseudo-cleric." Arrest and detention No information is
    available on the circumstances of Mr. Khavandi s arrest and detention.
    Trial No specific information about the trial was provided. Charges Based
    on the report, the defendant was charged with acting against the Islamic
    Republic government, shooting at innocent people and the revolutionary
    guards, spreading corruption and distributing opium, murder and plunder of
    people, kidnapping, armed robbery, martyring several revolutionary guards
    and army officers, and so forth. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report does
    not provide any information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information on the accused s defense is available.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz declared Mr.
    Khavandi a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. The sentence was
    carried out at dawn.
