    daily (July 26, 1980) Arrest and detention The circumstances of this

    information about the circumstances of the trial is available. Charges The
    report quoted the news headquarters of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards,
    which announced the defendant s charges as several acts incompatible with
    chastity , selling her body repeatedly , making oppressed girls available
    to unchaste men , and obtaining and distributing drugs. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Evidence of guilt The report contains no
    information about the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of Dezful sentenced Ms. Zarkaf to death.
