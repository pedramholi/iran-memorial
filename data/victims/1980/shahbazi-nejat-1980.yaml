    The execution of Mr. Nejat Shahbazi and 9 others was reported by the
    correspondent of Pars News Agency in Hamedan. This execution was ordered
    by an itinerant religious judge passing through the region at night on
    November 15th. The Jomhuri Eslami daily published the report (November 17,
    1980). Arrest and detention Based on the report, the arrest was carried
    out by the officials of the Islamic Revolutionary Committee of Merianj and
    the anti-narcotics task force accompanying the itinerant religious judge
    in the middle of the night. Trial No trial was held. The Pars News
    correspondent notes that the case received the necessary considerations by
    the itinerant religious judge in the village of Merianj. Charges The
    specific charge against the defendant is unknown. However, the report
    notes that Mr. Shahbazi was one of the well-known drug producers and
    dealers. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The charge against this
    defendant is reportedly based on confessions of two drug addicts arrested
    and interrogated after being noticed in a gas station that night by the
    itinerant religious judge. Defense The report provides no information
    about whether or not the defendant was given an opportunity to defend
    himself in the few hours he was detained. Judgment The religious judge
    sentenced Mr. Shahbazi to death sometime between his arrest during the
    night and his execution at 11:00 a.m. The sentence was carried out in the
    Merianj cemetery.
