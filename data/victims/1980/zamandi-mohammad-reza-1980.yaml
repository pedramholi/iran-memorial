circumstances: >
    The execution of Mohammadreza Zamandi was reported along with six others
    by the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Sabzevar (August 23,
    1980). Arrest and detention The report indicated that the defendant was
    caught carrying large quantities of opium but managed to escape from
    Narcotics Agents. According to the report, the defendant was eventually
    arrested through the zealous efforts of Pasdar [Revolutionary Guard]
    brothers . Trial The report provided no information on Mr. Zamandi s
    trial. Charges Based on the report, the defendant was charged with being a
    number one drug dealer in Sabzevar Desert who has been involved in armed
    drug dealing under various rubrics . The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report indicated that
    the defendant was arrested while carrying three kilograms and five hundred
    grams of opium. Defense No information on the accused s defense is
    available. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sabzevar
    sentenced Mr. Zamandi to death. He was executed at dawn, three days after
    his trial.
