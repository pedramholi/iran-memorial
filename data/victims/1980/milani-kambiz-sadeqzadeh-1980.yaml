    Islamic Republic to Destroy a Religious Community . It describes the
    persecution of the Baha i Community of Iran and includes a list of Baha is
    who have been killed in Iran since 1978. Mr. Sadeqzadeh Milani was born

    trusted by the Baha i community . (Boroumand Center Interview, June 12,
    2017) The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979 (1) - to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence. (2) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the
    Baha i threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national
    security in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Baha i
    National Spiritual Assembly After the Islamic Revolution In the
    organizational structure of the Baha i community, the institution of the
    National Spiritual Assembly is a body composed of nine individuals that
    are elected annually with the votes of adult Baha is in each country. This
    institution tends to the affairs and issues of the Baha i community on the
    national level. The National Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of
    guiding, coordinating, and moving forward the activities of each country s
    local spiritual assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl (
    House of Justice ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the
    highest decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. In 1980
    and 1981, the First, Second, and Third National Spiritual Assemblies, as
    well as local Baha i spiritual assemblies in various cities, including
    Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz, were severely persecuted and the
