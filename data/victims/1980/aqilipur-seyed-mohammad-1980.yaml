    The execution of Seyyed Mohammad Aqilipur, resident of Fariman, was
    reported along with six others by the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily in Sabzevar (August 23, 1980). Arrest and detention There is no
    information available on the circumstances of Mr. Aqilipur s arrest and
    detention in this report. Trial The report provided no information on Mr.
    Aqilipur s trial. Charges Based on the report, the defendant was charged
    with being a number one drug dealer and part of a major drug cartel . The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report indicated that the defendant was arrested with three kilograms and
    five hundred grams of opium on him. Defense No information on the accused
    s defense is available. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Sabzevar sentenced Mr. Aliqolipur to death. He was executed at dawn, three
    days after his trial.
