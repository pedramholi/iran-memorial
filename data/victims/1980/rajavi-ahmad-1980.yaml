circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Rajavi was reported by the correspondent of the
    Jomhuri Eslami daily in Isfahan (July 9, 1980). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the circumstances of the trial.
    Charges According to the report, the defendant was charged with acting as
    an intermediary in buying and selling drugs and sedition records such as
    robbery, battery, gambling, and hooliganism. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rajavi s
    defense. Judgment The religious judge at the Special Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Isfahan for Combating Drugs and Narcotics declared Mr. Rajavi
    a corruptor on earth. He was sentenced to death.
