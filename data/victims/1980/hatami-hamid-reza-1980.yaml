    The information about Mr. Hamidreza Hatami is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs in the Path to Freedom by Rah-e Kargar publications. He was a
    17-year-old high school student and a sympathizer of the Rah-e Kargar
    Organization. He sold and distributed the Organization s publications.
    "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was
    established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They introduced themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Arrest and detention According to the Rah-e Kargar book, three
    months after he joined the Rah-e Kargar Organization, Mr. Hatami was
    arrested on September 3, 1980 as he was selling the Kargar publication.
    The Revolutionary Guards shoved him in a car and took him presumably to
    the court. However, the next day, workers in Kuhnamaki quarter of Tabriz
    found his bloody body on the road between Tabriz and Ahar. They took him
    to the hospital. His head and his hand were shattered by bullets and his
    chest and chin were slashed with knife wounds. He spent 15 days in a coma
    and died on September 19, 1980. Trial No information is available on the
