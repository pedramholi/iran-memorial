    Mr. Kamal Yasini’s execution was announced by the public relations office
    of the Chief Revolutionary Public Prosecutor along with that of six other
    members of the dissident guerilla movement, Forqan. The announcement was
    published in the Ettela’at newspaper (March 3, 1980). Additional
    information has been drawn from an interview with an individual familiar
    with this case. According to the interviewee, a close relative of Mr.
    Yasini’s, he was a student of Applied Physics and an attendee of Teacher’s
    College. He started his political activities before the Revolution at the
    Khatam library of A’zam Mosque in the neighborhood of Qolhak, where he
    studied the ideas of Dr. Ali Shari’ati under Ali Hatami (who was executed
    in June 1980). At that time, he also attended Qoran study sessions headed
    by Akbar Gudarzi (the mastermind of Forqan) in Khamseh Mosque. Mr.
    Yasini’s basic belief was Islam without the clergy. Forqan was formed in
    1977 by a group of Ali Shari’ati’s followers with a modern interpretation
    of the Qoran and Islamic ideology. It is not clear whether or not the
    group was armed, but it went underground soon after its formation. Based
    on documents available in the archives of the Islamic Revolution
    Documentation Center (gathered and reported by Ahmad Gudarzi on Bacheha-ye
    Ghalam website), this group opposed from the onset of the Revolution the
    involvement of the clergy in the government and the particular
    interpretation of Islam later implemented by the Islamic Republic
    authorities. In its short period of post-revolutionary activity, the group
    was accused of involvement in several assassinations and armed robberies,
    the first one reportedly as early as May 1979, only a couple of months
    after the triumph of the Revolution. Based on the above mentioned report,
    most of the known members of the group were executed or killed in clashes
    with Islamic Revolutionary Committee forces, which led to the total
    elimination of the group in January 1980. Arrest and detention According
    to the interviewee, Mr. Yasini was arrested in a team house on December
    23, 1979 (a week after he assassinated Mohammad Mofatteh, a member of the
    Islamic Republic clergy, on December 18). His arrest did not involve armed
    resistance. Mr. Yasini was detained for 68 days before he was executed. He
    was allowed visitors twice during this time, the second time being the
    evening before his execution. In that visit, he bid his family goodbye and
    handed his personal belonging to them. According to the interviewee, Mr.
    Yasini had faith in his path until the very last moment of his life. Trial
    According to the interviewee, Mr. Yasini was tried twice at Evin Prison
    and did not have the right to appeal. The details of the trials are
    unknown. The announcement in the Ettela’at newspaper specified that the
    verdict was issued by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center
    (Tehran); however, no information regarding the circumstances of the trial
    was provided. Charges According to the announcement, Mr. Yasini was
    charged with “murdering Martyr Dr. Mohammad Mofatteh, Martyr Haj Mehdi
    Araqi, Martyr Hesam Araqi, and Martyr Asghar Ne’mati,” and “attempting to
    assassinate Hojatoleslam Rafsanjani” as well as “armed robbery from the
    Islamic Republic’s banks.” Evidence of guilt According to the interviewee,
    Mr. Yasini confessed to the assassination of Mohammad Mofatteh and did not
    express repentance. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Yasini’s defense, except that he was
    not allowed to have an attorney. Judgment Mr. Yasini was executed by a
    firing squad, along with six others, in the courtyard of Evin Prison at 1
    A.M. on March 3, 1980. His body was handed over to his family that same
    morning.
