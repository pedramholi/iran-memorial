    He lived in the United States and had returned to Iran for a visit. During

    the people of Andimeshk, he was taking photographs of the demonstrations.
    Information regarding the execution of Mohammad Reza Rostami, along with
    three others, as well as the arbitrary execution of five others in the
    street, was gathered from two interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center (ABC) one with a participant in the Andimeshk protest of
    March 1980 (April 15, 2024) and the other with a political activist from
    Andimeshk at the time, as well as a statement by Khomeini s envoy

    newspaper (July 27, 1980) and Kayhan newspaper (July 25, 1980), which also
    reported the execution of 15 others. Additional information was also taken
    from the IRGC's publicity in the Jomhouri Eslami, Ettela'at, and Enqelab-e
    Eslami newspapers (March 17, 1980); Peykar Magazine, the publication of
    the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class (April 1

    2023); Kar, the publication of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization Minority;
    and several websites, including Jahan-e Novin (March 1980), Akhbar-e Rooz
    (by Mokhtar Shalalvand, June 4, 2012), Nedaye Azadi (by Fariba Marzban,
    September 27, 2013), Pezhvak-e Iran (by Iraj Mesdaghi and Musa Hatamian,
    August 9, 2017, and August 2017), and Asr-e No (by Ali Mohammad Jahangiri,
    April 12, 2017). According to available information, Mr. Rostami had lived
    in the United States for some time and had returned to Iran for a visit.
    "It had been no more than six months since he had returned from the United
    States." He was a member of the Independent Union of the Unemployed
    Workers and a supporter of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. However,
    "there is no information available on which faction he supported after the
    split within the Fadaiyan organization" (Nedaye Azadi - Fariba Marzban,
    September 27, 2013) His case was related to the protests in Andimeshk in
    1980. 1980 Andimeshk Protest Less than a year after the 1979 revolution,
    an atmosphere of hope emerged among young people seeking justice and
    social rights. During this period, there were numerous protests in cities
    such as Tehran, Tabriz, Mahabad, Sari, Amol, Shiraz, Isfahan, Ilam, Gonbad
    Kavus, Rasht and Abadan, where demonstrators demanded jobs and economic
    rights. Unemployed youth in various regions sought to organize their
    employment-related issues by forming independent associations or unions,
    free from political affiliations. In Tabriz, for example, the " Graduate
    and Post-Graduate Union" was formed, which successfully held meetings with
    provincial authorities and received official recognition from the
    provincial government, allowing it to pursue its goals. Similar
    organizations in other cities, however, faced harsh repression. In one
    notable incident, one person was killed and four others were injured
    during a crackdown on protests by unemployed workers in Isfahan.
    Unemployed workers' associations in Dorud and Andimeshk were also
    violently repressed. At the time, Andimeshk's population had increased due
    to an influx of migrants and wartime displacement, exacerbating social
    problems in the area. The Independent Union of the Unemployed in Andimeshk
    was founded after the 1979 revolution with a focus on workers' rights. It
    aimed to defend the right to work and to protest "appointed hiring
    practices in state institutions and the interference of Islamic
    associations in employment decisions. Early on, union representatives
    negotiated with the mayor, who gave them a room in the city hall. This
    space became their official headquarters and helped them organize their
    efforts more effectively. Union members gathered there daily to hold
    meetings and send letters to Andimeshk authorities demanding jobs for the
    city's unemployed. Despite no official response, the union's activities,
    such as distributing flyers and organizing protests, gained strong support
    from young people. Between 3,000 and 4,000 unemployed youth joined the
    union, paying a small membership fee. Despite the mayor's initial
    cooperation with the union, this resulted in a series of disagreements
    between the mayor's office and the governor's office. These disagreements
    ultimately led to the mayor's dismissal. According to union members, the
    government ignored their demands, which included giving priority to hiring
    local workers. In response, the union organized a sit-in at the Ministry
    of Education, where members stayed for several days, giving speeches and
    reading statements from various organizations and political groups
    supporting the unemployed. Local residents also supported the protest by
    bringing food for the demonstrators. However, the sit-in was
