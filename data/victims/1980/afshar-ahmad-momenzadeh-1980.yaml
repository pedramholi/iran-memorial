    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Momenzadeh Afshar and his brother, Adolqasem,
    was announced in a communiqu of the Islamic Revolutionary Public
    Prosecution Office of Orumiyeh, published by the Jomhuri Eslami daily
    (July 22, 1980). Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant
    s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Based on the communiqu , the
    verdict was issued by the Special Court for Drugs and Narcotics. Charges
    The communiqu mentioned that the Momenzadeh Afshar brothers were charged
    with drug dealing. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Momenzadeh Afshar s defense. Judgment The brothers were sentenced to
    death. Based on the communiqu , the sentence was carried out by the
    representative of the religious judge in Orumiyeh.
