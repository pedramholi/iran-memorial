circumstances: >
    The execution of this individual named Rasul and 6 others was reported by
    the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Tabriz (July 15, 1980).
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against these defendants
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial There is no information available about
    the circumstances of the trial. Charges Based on the report, the defendant
    was charged with repeated adultery , distributing pornographic papers ,
    gambling , opium , and spreading corruption. Evidence of guilt The report
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Rasul s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz sentenced Mr. Rasul
    to death. He was executed in the evening.
