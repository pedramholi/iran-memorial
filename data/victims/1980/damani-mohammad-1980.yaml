    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Damani was reported by the correspondent of
    the Ettela’at dailyfrom Zahedan (March 8, 1980) The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    report mentioned that the defendant was arrested by the Revolutionary
    Guards (Pasadaran), but the specific circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are unknown. Trial According to the report, the defendant was
    tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Zahedan; however, no
    specific information regarding the circumstances of the trial was
    provided. Charges Based on the report, Mr. Damani was charged with “armed
    robbery on the Iranshahr-Chabahar road” and “murdering two drivers.”
    Evidence of guilt This report contained no information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the accused’s defense. Judgment Mr. Damani was sentenced to
