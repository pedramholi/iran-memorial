    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Rahim Kavkar was reported by the
    correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Tabriz (June 16, 1980).
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges Based on the report, Mr. Kavkar was charged
    with attempting to buy two kilograms of heroin. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Kavkar s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz sentenced
    Mr. Kavkar to death and confiscation of the 115,000 tomans with which he
    was planning to buy the heroin. He was executed at midnight.
