    The execution of Dr. Faramarz Samandari, son of Taraz, was announced in
    the daily Kahyan (July 16, 1980) through a notice issued by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Justice and confirmed by various other media
    sources (See: dailies Kayhan (July 14, 1980) Announcement by Prison Warden
    , Sobh-e Azadegan (July 15, 1980), Bamdad (July 15, 1980), Jomhouri Eslami
    (July 15, 1980). Information about the life and execution of Dr. Samandari
    was obtained from an article written by his wife, Mrs. Anita (Carr)
    Samandari, that appeared in the Baha i News Issue 603 (June 1981), as well
    as documents published in the Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran
    (ABPI), the IranWire website and a Facebook post by one of his students
    (FB Post, 2019). Additionally, the Abdorrahman Boroumand Centre for Human
    Rights in Iran was able to speak briefly with a ward mate of Dr.
    Samandari, who was able to provide some information about his time in
    prison (ABC interview, July 3rd, 2022). Dr. Samandari is also one of the
    206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report documents the persecution of the
    members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is
    killed since 1978. Additional information has been drawn from various
    issues of the The Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986,
    Haifa 1994. Dr. Samandari was born into a Baha i family in Babol on
    February 18, 1933 (Samandari article, Baha i News Issue 603 and ABPI). He
    was married and had three children. In 1980 he was an elected member of
    the Local Spiritual Assembly of the Baha is of Tabriz. He studied medicine
    at the University of Tabriz, before completing two years of compulsory
    military service (ABPI, Bio). Following his discharge, Dr. Samandari was
    awarded a government scholarship to further his studies in Canada, where
    he worked and studied for seven years. He became an otolaryngological
    (ears, nose and throat) microsurgeon and pioneered techniques for hearing
    aid implantations that have since become common practice (IranWire). When
    he returned to Tabriz in 1967, he was appointed as a Professor of Medicine
    at Tabriz University and worked at Tabriz University Hospital, seeing,
    according to his wife, sometimes 100 patients a day. According to one of
    his students, he often personally covered the medical expenses of patients
    who could not afford care and made house-calls out to ill farmers (FB
    Post, 2019). After the 1979 revolution, the Canadian government advised
    all Canadian nationals in Iran to leave the country (IranWire). Dr.
    Samandari urged his wife, who was Canadian, to return to Canada with their
    children, which she did shortly before the 1979 revolution . Dr. Samandari
    saw his wife and children for the last time when he visited them in Canada
    that year and returned to Iran because of his strong sense of duty to his
    patients. (Article by Mrs. Anita (Carr) Samandari, Baha i News Issue 603)
    One of his students wrote in a Facebook post that Dr. Samandari was once
    stopped by a student when leaving the clinic he worked in and asked why he
    had come back; Dr. Samandari looked around the courtyard filled with
    patients of modest means and said for them (FB Post, 2019). The Baha is in
    the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and Detention Dr. Samandari was arrested
    on April 22nd1980 and held in Tabriz Prison, in the Band-e Seganeh ward.
