circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Heidar Shabahi and 9 others was reported by the
    correspondent of Pars News Agency in Hamedan. The itinerant religious
    judge who ordered this execution on November 16th was traveling from
    another location that day where he had ordered the execution of 4
    individuals at 11:00 am. The Jomhuri Eslami daily published the report
    (November 17, 1980). Arrest and detention Based on the report, the
    religious judge traveled to the village of Dareh Morad Beyk in the
    outskirts of Hamedan to deal with issues pertaining to drug dealing in the
    region. It was there that, after necessary considerations, Mr. Shabahi and
    5 others were arrested. Trial The report mentioned that the religious
    judge tried the defendant immediately after his arrest, but no information
    was provided about the time and circumstances of the trial. Charges
    According to the report, Mr. Shabahi was accused of drug dealing. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on the
    evidence presented against the accused. Defense The report provides no
    information about whether or not the defendant was given an opportunity to
    defend himself. Judgment The religious judge sentenced Mr. Shabahi to
    death, following his arrest and trial on the same day. The sentence was
    immediately carried out in Dareh Morad Beyk, the same location at which he
    was arrested and tried.
