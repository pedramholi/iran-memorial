    Information about the execution of Mr. Reza Firuzi, son of Hasan and
    Khanum and father of five, was obtained from an announcement by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz published in Jomhuri Eslami daily
    (November 12th, 1980) and Kayhan Daily Newspaper (November 11th, 1980) as
    well as articles published in the Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran
    (ABPI, Bio), IranWire (January 29th, 2021) and the Baha i Chronicles
    (Interview with granddaughter). Mr. Firuzi is also one of the 206 Iranian
    Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i International
    Community. The report documents the persecution of the members of the Baha
    i faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists members killed since
    1978. Additional information has been drawn from various issues of The
    Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Mr. Reza
    Firuzi, was born to a Muslim family in Ahar, East Azerbaijan Province in
    1906 (ABPI, Bio). After the death of his parents, he had to stop his high
    school education and began working as a tailor and completed his military
    service. He lived in Tabriz for a few years before returning to Ahar in
    1942 where he ran his own gas station and was employed by the Ahar Oil
    Company (IranWire). Mr. Firuzi converted to Baha ism in 1935 and was a
    member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Ahrar (ABPI, Bio). He is
    remembered by his family members as an honest and hardworking man, a
    dedicated husband, and a good father (Baha i Chronicles). The Baha is in
    the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979 (1) - to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence. (2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Baha i National Spiritual Assembly After the
    Islamic Revolution In the organizational structure of the Baha i
    community, the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly is a body
    composed of nine individuals that are elected annually with the votes of
    adult Baha is in each country. This institution tends to the affairs and
    issues of the Baha i community on the national level. The National
    Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of guiding, coordinating, and
    moving forward the activities of each country s local spiritual
    assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl ( House of Justice
    ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the highest
    decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I s
    Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual
    assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz,
    were severely persecuted and the majority of their members were executed.
    In The Final Message of the Iran National Spiritual Assembly to the
    Friends of the Country , the Third Baha i National Spiritual Assembly,
    abiding by the principle of obeying the government, announced the closure
    of the Baha i organizations, and at the same time, sent an open letter to
    two thousand well-known and high-ranking government figures asking an end
    to the arrest, detention, torture, execution, and injustice against Baha
    is. (BBC Persian website, October 11, 2015). Judicial officials of the
    Islamic Republic have come up with [unreasonable and unacceptable]
    justifications for the persecution and the execution of the members of the
    National Spiritual Assemblies. In a speech on May 28, 1
