circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ali Asghar Yusefi and another individual was reported
    by the correspondent the Ettela at daily in Neyshabur (Jan 12, 1980) The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian

    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.

    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial The report provided no specific

    defendant was charged with setting up a gang to carry out armed robberies
    as well as killing and intimidating people. Evidence of guilt This report
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on the accused s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Neyshabur declared Mr.
    Yusefi a corruptor on earth, and he was executed at dawn.
