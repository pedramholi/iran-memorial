    The execution of this unnamed person and 8 others was announced in a
    report by the correspondent of Pars News Agency in Kerman, published in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily (June 21, 1980) The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the circumstances of the defendant’s trial, except that
    the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman held session on Thursday,
    June 19, 1980, to examine the cases of 33 drug smugglers, including that
    of this unnamed individual. Charges Based on the report, the defendants
    were collectively charged with the following: “carrying and distributing
    drugs, participating in the murder of a Revolutionary Guard, spreading
    prostitution, keeping alcoholic drinks, engaging in sexually dishonoring
    offenses, taking advantage of innocent children and raping them, and
    robbery.” The report does not specify the charges against each individual
    separately. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on the accused’s defense. Judgment The
    religious judge of the Special Revolutionary Tribunal and the head of the
    Combat against Drugs and Narcotics sentenced this unnamed individual to
    death. The death sentence was carried out at dawn.
