    The execution of Mr. Kaka Morad Hassanzadeh Garavand and two others was
    announced by the Operation Commander of Khoramabad s Islamic Revolutionary
    Guards (Pasdaran) to Pars News Agency. The Jomhuri Eslami daily published
    the report (August 19, 1980). Arrest and detention There is no information
    available on Mr. Hassanzadeh s arrest and detention. Trial The report does
    not provide any information on Mr. Hassanzadeh s trial. Charges Based on
    the report, the defendant was charged with armed robbery on Gardaneh
    Kuhdasht road and participation in the murder of one of Khoramabad s
    Islamic Revolutionary Guards . The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defense No information on the accused s defense is available. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Khoramabad declared Mr. Hassanzadeh a
    corruptor on earth and an enemy of God and sentenced him to death. The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center (Tehran) confirmed the
    verdict, and the defendant was hanged at the Bayazdid crossroad at dawn.
