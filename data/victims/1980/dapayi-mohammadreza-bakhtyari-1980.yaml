    The execution of Mr. Mohammadreza Bakhtyari (also known as Mohammad
    Dapayi) was reported by the correspondent of Pars News Agency in Ahvaz.
    The report was published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (July 26, 1980)
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are unknown. Trial No specific information about the
    circumstances of the trial is available. Charges The report quoted the
    news headquarters of The Islamic Revolutionary Guards, which announced the
    defendant s charges as obtaining and distributing drugs as well as
    committing the dirty acts of sodomy and extramarital sexual intercourse.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against these defendants
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report does not contain any information
    about the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information
    is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of Dezful sentenced Mr. Bakhtyari to
    death. He stood before the firing squad at dawn.
