    With conflict in Kordestan, she and her younger sister were nurses at the
    same hospital. Their ethics were on view, as patients arrived from both
    sides of the clashes. Ms. Shahla Ka'bi is one of the two Kurdish sisters,
    both nurses, whose execution was ordered by the itinerant religious judge,
    Sadeq Khalkhali ( Jomhuri Eslami daily, 31 August 1980). Further
    information about this individual was obtained through an interview (6 May
    2004) with one of her close relatives who indicated that details regarding
    the defendant's detention and execution were passed on to them by one of
    her former cellmates. The relative also referred to a brief section
    regarding the Ka'bi sisters in the Book of Prison (Naser Mohajeri, ed.,
    Vol. 1, P 189) and noted that a tribute commemorating their execution was
    published in the Komeleh Party newsletter of 31 August 2001. The arrest
    and execution of Ms. Ka'bi took place in the context of intensifying, and
    at times armed, conflict between the Islamic revolutionary government of
    Iran and the mainly Sunni province of Kurdistan regarding the drafting of
    the constitution and, in particular, the autonomy of the region. Following
    Ayatollah Khomeini s order in 18 August 1979 to combat the
    anti-Revolutionary elements in Kurdistan, at least 58 Kurds were executed
    by the itinerant religious judge Sadeq Khalkhali in the course of ten
    days, 19-29 August 1979 (Mansoor Boloori, The Demise of Sadeq Khalkhali ,
    Iranian Political Bulletin, 30 November 2003). Arrest and detention Based
    on the interview, Ms. Ka'bi was first arrested and exiled to Qazvin along
    with her sister in the fall of 1979, following the military crackdown on
    the Kurdistan province. In the spring of 1980, and after negotiations
    between a government mission headed by Daryush Foruhar and the Kurdish
    People s Representative Delegation, she was encouraged to go back to her
    home and profession. On June 14, 1980, following the re-capturing of
    several Kurdish cities by government armed forces, she was re-arrested
    along with her sister. The arrest warrant was issued by Ayatollah Sadeq
    Khalkhali, and she was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards from her home
    in Saqqez. Ms. Ka'bi spent a total of three months in detention at the
    Saqqez, Sanandaj, and Evin prisons. During this time, she was interrogated
    by local and other Revolutionary Guards, had no access to legal counsel,
    and was prohibited from contacting or visiting family and relatives. Trial
    Based on the available information, no trial was held for this person.
    Charges The Jomhuri Eslami report mentioned Ms. Ka'bi's charges as
    "participation in recent clashes" and "collaboration with the insurgents."
    However, the reason given by the authorities to her family for her arrest
    was "treating the anti-Revolutionaries in the Saqqez hospital." Evidence
    of guilt Based on the available information, no evidence was presented to
    support the charges brought against the defendant. Defense Ms. Ka'bi was
    not given a chance to defend herself. Ms. Ka'bi who, according to her
    family, was not politically involved, had engaged in treating the victims
    of these clashes as a nurse in the hospital. Her relative referred to her
    altruism and work ethics as a nurse and added that she would treat anyone
    in need, including Revolutionary Guards. Judgment According to Ms. Ka'bi's
    cellmate, the religious judge issued a collective death sentence for the
    prisoners at the Sanandaj Garrison at night. The sentence was carried out
    at dawn. One of the prisoners present at the Garrison described Ms.
    Ka'bi's execution as follows: "The guard takes Shahla and her sister,
    Nasrin, out of the prison ward without saying a word. The sisters stand
    next to each other with their backs to the wall, their hands tied behind
    their backs. A Revolutionary Guard brings two pieces of black fabric to
    blindfold them. Nasrin refuses to be blindfolded, but Shahla accepts. The
    Guard scorns: 'You are afraid, huh?!' Shahla says: 'Of course not! I just
    don't want to see my sister die.' At this point, Nasrin asks to be
    blindfolded as well."
