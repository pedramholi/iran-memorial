    The information about the execution of Mr. Naser Charkh and three other
    individuals has been taken from the communiqué of the Prosecutor’s Office
    of the Sistan and Baluchestan province and published in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper, dated July 20, 1980. According to this communiqué, when Mr.
    Charkh and four other police officers left their headquarters in Rask
    (Sistan and Baluchestan province) on a mission, they were attacked by
    rebels on the road and their arms were forcefully taken away from them.
    One of the officers was killed in the confrontation. Based on the news
    published Jomhuri Eslami , a few days after the Rask incident, 11 members
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps were killed by rebels in a
    similar event. The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sistan and
    Baluchestan convicted the remaining four men from the Rask incident on the
    grounds that “if [they] had not given up their ammunition [to the rebels],
    which is in itself a great conspiracy, the rebels would have never gotten
    the false idea that they could also steal the ammunition of the
    Revolutionary Guards without any resistance.” There is no evidence upon
    which to verify the veracity of these claims or the existence of any
    connection between the two mentioned events. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Charkh’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    There is no information regarding this trial other than the defendants
    were tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sistan and
    Baluchestan. Charges The collective charges brought against Mr. Charkh and
    his three codefendants have been published in the newspaper as “submission
    of arms to murders of 10 martyred Revolutionary Guards”. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    No information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available concerning Mr. Charkh’s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal named Mr. Naser
    Charkh a “corruptor on earth” and “at war with God and hid prophet” and
    condemned him to death. He was executed, along with his three
    codefendants, in Rask at 9 p.m. on July 19, 1980.
