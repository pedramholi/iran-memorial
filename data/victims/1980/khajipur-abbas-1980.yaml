    Tribunals of this state. The court session lasted 16 uninterrupted hours.

    smuggling drugs through the Afghanistan border and distributing them all
    over the country. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report mentioned that
    Mr. Khajipur was arrested with nine kilograms of opium in his possession
    and tried to bribe the Strike Group narcotics agents with 1,400,000
    Tomans. Defense No information is available on the accused s defense.
