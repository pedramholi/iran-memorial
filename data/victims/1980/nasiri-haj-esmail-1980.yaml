circumstances: >
    The execution of Haj Esmail Nasiri, resident of Sijan, was reported by the
    correspondent of Jomhuri Eslami daily in Arak (August 17, 1980). Arrest
    and detention No information about the circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention is available, except that he escaped his house when
    the officials initially came looking for him. Trial No information about
    the trial is provided by the report. Charges The defendant was charged
    with a drug related offence The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentenced to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report
    mentioned that the anti-narcotics agents found a large amount of opium in
    the defendant s house. Defense No information on the accused s defense is
    available. Judgment The Anti-Narcotic Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal,
    located at Qasr Prison, sentenced Mr. Nasiri to death. The sentence was
    carried out at Sanjan Cemetery at dawn.
