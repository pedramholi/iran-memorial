circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Asad Postdar was reported by Pars News Agency. The
    Jomhuri Eslami daily published the report (July 30, 1980). Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Based on the report, Mr. Postdar was charged with the following:
    having connections with anti-revolutionary elements , collaboration and
    participation in the explosion of the Iraqi repatriates residential area ,
    activity to strengthen the previous regime , stick-wielding assaults
    against the struggles of the Muslim people of Iran , establishing a center
    of prostitution , sexual assault to his own brother s wife , and forcing
    his own wife to sell her body. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information
    is available regarding the evidence provided to prove any of the
    above-mentioned charges. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Postdar s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Qasr e
    Shirin and Sar e Pol e Zahab found Mr. Postdar guilty of corruption on
    earth. He was executed at 10:30 p.m.
