    He was a well-known, respected man in Ardebil and was known as a
    chivalrous man who helped others solve their problems. News of the
    execution of Mr. Mir Ali Akbar Mirkarimi, along with another person, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on July 2, 1980. The Abdorrahman
    Bouroumand Foundation (ABF) took additional information from an interview
    with a person close to him in the summer of 2015. Mr. Mirkarimi was
    married with four children and a resident of Ardebil. He produced charcoal
    and had two bakeries and a boarding house. He was a well-known, respected
    man in the Alikuchsi neighborhood in Ardebil and was known as a chivalrous
    man who helped others solve their problems. In spite of the fact that he
    had a sharp tongue and was quick-tempered, he helped others, especially
    poor people. (ABF interview) Mr. Mirkarimi was a member of the Religious
    Board of Trustees in his neighborhood. Before the revolution, he was
    detained for a short period because of a poem he composed against
    injustice and in support of the deprived. He was not a member of any
    political group but he was a sympathizer of the monarchy. (ABF interview)
    Arrest and detention Revolutionary agents arrested Mr. Mirkarimi with a
    warrant issued by the religious judge of Ardebil during his son s wedding
    in July of 1980. His family had no news of him for the next few days. He
    was detained at a small prison in Tazeh Meidan in Ardebil. (ABF interview)
    Trial The Revolutionary Court of Ardebil tried Mr. Mirkarimi openly on
    June 29, 1980. According to the existing information, several dignitaries
    and elders of Ardebil were present during his trial. He had no attorney
    during the trial. (ABF interview) Charges Based on the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper report, Mr. Mirkarimi was charged with murder in one case and
    involuntary manslaughter in another as well as collaboration with the
    idolatrous regime and corruption on earth. According to the interviewee,
    he was charged with a murder during the ruling of the Azerbaijan
    Democratic Party in 1945-46. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the existing
    information, several individuals testified against Mr. Mirkarimi during
    his trial claiming that he had influenced offices such as the courthouse
    during the Pahlavi regime and cooperated with the previous regime.
    According to the interviewee, these individuals had animosity toward and
    ongoing disputes with Mr. Mirkarimi. (ABF interview) Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Mirkarimi s defense. According to the
    interviewee, some clerics in Ardebil demanded that Mr. Mirkarimi declare
    his unfaithfulness toward the monarchy in court and not say anything
    against the revolution and authorities. He had rejected this request and
    spoken harshly against the judge. As a result, the court session was
    terminated prematurely. (ABF interview) Judgment The court identified Mr.
    Mir Ali Akbar Mirkarimi as a Mofsed [corruptor on Earth] and condemned him
    to death. According to the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, the ruling was
    carried out on the same day as his trial and he was executed by firing
    squad on July 1, 1980 at 9 p. m. However, according to the interviewee,
    the ruling was carried out the next day after the trial and without
    informing his family. Because his trial was incomplete and based on
    unofficial rumors, Mr. Mirkarimi s family and acquaintances expected his
    release and were all shocked by the news of his execution. His body was
    given to his family for burial. (ABF interview)
