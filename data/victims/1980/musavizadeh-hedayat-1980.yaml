circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Hedayat Musavizadeh and Ms. Farideh Baba'i was
    reported in the Ettela at daily (Jan 7, 1980). Arrest and detention No
    information is available on the circumstances of Mr. Musavizadeh s arrest
    and detention. Trial The report did not provide any information regarding
    Mr. Musavizadeh s trial. Charges According to the report, the defendant
    was charged with acts of corruption such as sodomy, adultery, and taking
    advantage of girls. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no
    information about the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense
    The report provides no information about Mr. Musavizadeh s defense.
    Judgment According to the report, the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Ardebil sentenced Mr. Musavizadeh to death and he was immediately executed
    by firing squad in Ardebil on January 07, 1980.
