    individuals execution was published in Kayhan (September 4, 1980) and
    Ettela at (September 6, 1980) newspapers. Additional information was
    obtained through Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interviews with persons
    with knowledge of the case, and from the following audio, video, and print
    files: Video from a total of 50 hours of [the city of] Abadan s Cinema Rex
    Special Tribunal, including 49 videos totaling more than 19 hours of
    footage, published in the Tarikh-e Shafahi ( Oral History ) website; the
    book Behind the Scenes of the Islamic Revolution, the Confessions of
    Hossein Borujerdi, by Bahram Choubineh, published in France, 2002; the
    book The Tragedy of Cinema Rex, the Islamic Revolution s Fire, by Majid
    Ahmadian, published in France, February 2015; a series of articles
    entitled Who are the true perpetrators of Abadan s Cinema Rex [Fire ]
    published by the Enghelab-e Eslami Newspaper in Exile, 2015; The Cinema
    Rex Fire Special Program, by Radio Farda, 2005; and other sources. [1] Mr.
    Takb alizadeh, child of Ali, was a single man from and residing in Abadan.
    He had a sixth grade education and his main profession was welding. (Mr.
    Takb alizadeh s defense in the Abadan s Cinema Rex Special Tribunal s
    second session, August 25, 1980). Mr. Takb alizadeh lost his father as a
    child. His stepfather was an addict and made a living with Mr. Takb
    alizadeh s mother selling soft drinks by the road side. They lived in
    poverty. Mr. Takb alizadeh was an addict until the first political
    demonstrations in the city of Abadan in 1977, and had even sold drugs.
    According to the Special Prosecutor, Mr. Takb alizadeh was not an addict
    at the time of the trial in August 1980. (Boroumand Center research). Mr.
    Takb alizdeh s case is related to Abadan s Cinema Rex fire on August 19,
    1978. Mr. Takb alizadeh was 23 years old at the time of his execution. Mr.
    Takb alizadeh and Abadan s Religious Circle In the years before the
    Revolution, different religious and non-religious groups were active in
    the city of Abadan. Various evidence indicates that the magnitude of these
    struggles in the city [of Abadan] was never to the extent that it was in
    Qom and other cities like Esfahan and Tehran. (Enghelab-e Eslami Newspaper
    in Exile, August 3 to August 16, 1985; Boroumand Center interview with a
    local political activist). One of these active revolutionary groups was
    the city s religious circle that conducted its activities around the
    Esfahaniha Hosseinieh (a hosseinieh is a religious center resembling a
    mosque named after the third Shi a Imam, Hossein). Mr. Mussavi Tabrizi
    said this about that hosseinieh: Abadan s Esfahaniha Hosseinieh had the
    same influence and effect in attracting enlightened and revolutionary
    students and non-students in Abadan as Tehran s Ershad Hosseinieh, and
    transformed Abadan s ambiance to a revolutionary and religious one. This
    small religious group was in contact with other religious-revolutionary
    individuals in Abadan such as Mohammad Rashidian, a high school literature
    teacher and religious activist, as well as with groups in other cities.
    The group engaged in recruiting members, distributing Mr. Khomeini s
    pamphlets, and organizing speeches. (Boroumand Center research). In 1977,
    Mr. Takb alizadeh, who was an addict at the time, was introduced to the
    city s religious circles through one of his neighborhood friends named
    Asghar Noruzi. At the same time, he started associating with Abdollah
    Lorghaba and other individuals including Faraj Bazrkar. He promised his
    new friends in their first meeting that he would quit his addiction. Mr.
    Lorghaba, and people who gathered at his house for the purpose of
    conducting religious-revolutionary activities, established close friendly
    relations with Hossein [Takb alizadeh]. (Kayhan newspaper, August 31,
    1980). Mr. Takb alizadeh was closest to Mr. Bazrkar s in that circle. Mr.
    Takb alizadeh was introduced to activists in Esfahan through another
    individual who frequented Mr. Lorghaba s home named Mahmud Abolpur. Since
    Mr. Takb alizadeh travelled back and forth to Esfahan because his
    grandmother lived there, he also established contact with that city s
    religious activists in order to obtain books and notes. (Mr. Takb alizadeh
    s defense in the Abadan s Cinema Rex Special Tribunal s second session,
    August 25, 1980). Ali Akbar Parvaresh was active in the city of Abadan at
    the time. Mr. Parvaresh was one of Esfahsn s political-religious activists
    who were in contact with Seyyed Mohammad Beheshti before the Revolution.
    (Boroumand Center research). In the early months (March- April) of 1978,
    Mr. Takb alizadeh introduced several other friends from his neighborhood,
    namely, Fallah Mohammadi Hashemi and Yadollah Mohammadpur Hosseini, aka
    Zaghi, to Koran classes established by Mr. Lorghaba.
