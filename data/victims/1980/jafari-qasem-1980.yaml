    The execution of Mr. Qasem Ja fari, father of three, was reported in the
    Jomhuri Eslami daily (July 22, 1980). Arrest and detention Based on the
    report, the defendant was arrested at his work place the night before his
    execution. Trial The report mentioned that the defendant was tried the
    morning after his arrest at the Special Revolutionary Tribunal of District
    14 in Shar-e Ray. Charges Mr. Qasem Ja'fari was charged with an act
    incompatible with chastity. The report specifies that the defendant, a
    policeman during the Shah s, was fired before the revolution for the same
    crime and worked at a restaurant since then. He was arrested for deluding
    many young small-town boys and sexually assaulting them. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain any information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant s defense. Judgment Mr. Ja'fari was found
    guilty of corruption on earth. He was shot to death by District 14
    Revolutionary Guards at 2 pm, within an hour since the issuance of the
    verdict, at one of the headquarters in the district. In response to why
    they did not present the case to the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the
    Center before carrying out the sentence on their own, the head of District
    14 Committee s Task Force mentioned that the Special Revolutionary
    Tribunal held by this Committee took orders from the same Ayatollahs as
    the Center (Ayatollah Meshkini and Ayatollah Montazeri), which was why
    they did not seek consultation from the Center.
