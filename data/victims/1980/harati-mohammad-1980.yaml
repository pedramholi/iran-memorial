    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Harati, son of Hossein Ali, born in Yazd and
    a resident of Tehran, along with 9 other individuals was reported by the
    correspondent of Pars New Agency, quoting the religious judge of the
    Anti-Narcotic Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals. The Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper published the report on July 24, 1980. His name is mentioned in
    Memoirs of Ayatollah Khalkhali. Additional information was sent to Omid by
    a relative, via an electronic form. Mr. Harati was married but his wife
    had passed away. He had a daughter. Arrest and detention The defendant was
    arrested by the Tehran Police on July 22, 1980. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. But Ayatollah Khalkhali was in charge
    of the “interrogation” (electronic form). Charges Mr. Harati was charged
    with the following: he “was a loyalist of the previous regime, who, thanks
    to his support [for the previous regime] was able to accumulate much
    wealth and [he] opened opium and entertainment centers for the
    aristocracy, and has drawn the daughters of the wealthy to drug
    addiction.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt Based on the report, the defendant was arrested
    with 24 kilograms of opium. Defense No information is available on the
    defense. Judgment The religious judge of the Anti-Narcotic Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal, Ayatollah Khalkhali, sentenced Mr. Harati to
    death. He was executed early in the morning on Wednesday July 23, 1980.
    Based on the report, Ayatollah Khalkhali had told the Herati family that
    would reduce Mr. Harati’s sentence if the family paid a large fine. He
    received the fine but the execution was still carried out. Mr. Harati’s
    properties in Yazd and Kerman were confiscated.
