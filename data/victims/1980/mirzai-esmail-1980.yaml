circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Esma'il Mirza'i and another person was reported by
    the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Kerman (August 4, 1980).
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial There is no information available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges Based on the report, Mr. Mirza'i was charged
    with having committed “repeated robberies in Tehran, Varamin, and Kerman”
    and also “the fact that he was imprisoned several times before the
    Revolution.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report referred to
    the defendant’s “clear confessions” but did not specify the circumstances
    or the contents of the confessions. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mirza'i's defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman, “after hours of
    examination and deliberation,” declared Mr. Mirza'i a “corruptor on earth”
    and a “disturber of order and security” and sentenced him to death. The
    sentence was carried out at 6 p.m. on the same day.
