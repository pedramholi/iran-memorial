    News of the execution of Mr. Yadollah Mahbubian (also spelled " Yadu'llah
    Mahbubiyan") and 14 other individuals was published in Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper (July 30, 1980), the Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran
    website, and the Baha i Martyrs and Prominent Persons Facebook page (March
    21, 2014). According to available information, Mr. Mahbubian was born in
    the city of Hamedan into a Baha i family in 1930-31. He was a graduate of
    electronics engineering from Tehran University. Mr. Mahbubian was married
    and had a child. He sent his family to the United States as the Revolution
    was taking shape and joined them in February 1979. He had been living in
    the U.S. for six months when he was invited to return to Iran by the
    Iranian government s electric power company, and his safety was
    guaranteed. His private company and the rest of his assets and properties
    had been expropriated in the meantime. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in
    Iran). Another news item states that his colleagues in Tehran had asked
    him to return and manage the company s affairs. (Baha i Martyrs and
    Prominent Persons Facebook page). The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran: Background The Baha i religious community is the largest minority
    group in Iran, with approximately 300,000 members in 1979 (more current
    figures are not available).* The authorities of the Islamic Republic have
    subjected Baha is religious to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence. ** Arrest and detention There are two accounts of
    Mr. Mahbubian s arrest. One is that he was arrested and taken to Evin
    Prison upon his return to Iran in July-August 1979. (Archives of Baha i
    Persecution in Iran). According to another account, Mr. Mahbubian was
    arrested in July-August 1979, upon arriving in Tehran, and after he had
    gone to the Islamic Revolutionary Committee officials in order to figure
    out what he needed to do and to obtain the release of his real and
    personal property and his home s furnishings. . (Baha i Martyrs and
    Prominent Persons Facebook page). Mr. Mahbubian was in prison for a year
    and was severely tortured. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran). His
    family members and relatives explanations [to the relevant authorities]
    and numerous attempts at having him released bore no fruit. Trial The
    Markaz (Central) Islamic Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Mahbubian but there
    is no information regarding the trial session(s). Charges Mr. Mahbubian s
    charges were [conducting] transactions with the Royal Court, transferring
    funds to [the Baha i] Holy Land, assisting other Baha is, and activity in
    the Baha i community . (Baha i Martyrs and Prominent Persons Facebook
    page). Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Mahbubian. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Mahbubian s defense. Judgment Markaz
    Islamic Revolutionary Court sentenced Mr. Mahbubian to death. Mr.
    Mahbubian and 14 others were executed by a firing inside Evin Prison on
    July 31, 1980. Mr. Mahbubian was interred at the Golestan-e Javid Baha i
    cemetery in Tehran in a Baha i religious ceremony.

    Richard N. Ostling, Time Magazine,20 February 1984. Also see The
    Persecution of the Baha is of Iran, 1844-1984, by Douglas Martin, Baha i
    Studies,volume 12/13, 1984, p. 3. There is no information about the
    current number of Baha is in Iran. ** The Islamic Republic Penal Code
    grants no rights to Baha is, and the courts have denied them the right to
    redress or to protection against assault, murder, and other forms of
    persecution and abuse. In so doing, the courts have treated Baha is as
    unprotected citizens or apostates, citing eminent religious authorities
    whose edicts are considered a source of law equal to acts of Parliament.
    The Founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, made execution a
    punishment for the crime of apostasy and decreed that a Muslim would not
    be punished for killing an apostate. Banishment from public functions has
    seriously damaged the Baha is professional, economic, and social lives.
    Soon after the revolution, a Ministry of Labor directive called for the
    dismissal from public office and all governmental organizations and
    associations of those who belong to any of the misguided sects recognized
    by all Muslims as heretical deviations from Islam, or to organizations
    whose doctrine and constitution are based on rejection of the
    divinely-revealed religions. Finally, the mandatory requirement of speci
