    The execution of Mr. Cheragh Hooti was announced by the correspondent of

    house and destroying the pump for the well , participation in attacking

    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot

    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
    information regarding the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Hooti s defense. Judgment Mr.
    Hooti was found guilty of corruption on earth and waging war against God
    and his prophet. The report mentioned that considering the importance of
    maintaining security in the region, the defendant was executed immediately
    at 9 p.m.
