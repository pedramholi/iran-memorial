circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Soleimani, also known as Qasem Alipur, was reported
    by the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Babol (July 22, 1980).
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Soleimani s trial. Charges According to the report, Mr. Soleimani was
    charged with having extramarital sexual relationships with some of his
    relatives. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report does not
    contain any information about the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Babol sentenced Mr.
    Soleimani to death. He was executed at 2:20 a.m. in the former Shah s
    palace in Tehran.
