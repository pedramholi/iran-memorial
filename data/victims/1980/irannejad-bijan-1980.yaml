    The information about Mr. Bijan Irannejad, Air Force Captain, has been
    sent to Omid, through an electronic form, by a relative. The execution of
    Captain Irannejad and four other individuals was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami and Enqelab Eslami newspapers on July 20, 1980. Mr. Irannejad was
    born in Tehran on May 12, 1945. He graduated from the military collage.
    His file concerned the attempted coup, known as Nojeh. According to
    available information, the planners of the Nojeh coup were members of the
    armed forces and the Iran Party (social democrat and part of the Iranian
    National Front) who opposed the religious rule and believed in the
    separation of church and state. The core of the coup d’état plan was to
    fly aircrafts from Nojeh base in Hamedan and bomb some military targets as
    well as the residence of Ayatollah Khomeini. Another team was to take over
    the radio-television building in Tehran in order to announce the coup and
    expose the motives to the population. On July 9, 1980, the Islamic
    Republic of Iran authorities announced the discovering and dismantling of
    a civil and military network which had planned the coup d’état to
    overthrow the regime. Two months later, the organization Neghab, in a
    communiqué, claimed responsibility for this attempted ‘uprising.’ The
    Organization attested that ‘the path of Mossadegh is that of the people’
    and today ‘Bakhtiar is its authentic leader… We have risen up to put an
    end to this curse [the Islamic regime] and to entrust the affairs of our
    land to the faithful disciple of Mossadegh – Shapur Bakhtiar’” (Iran: In
    Defense of Human Rights, National Movement of the Iranian Resistance,
    Paris, 1983). Following the discovery of the plan for the coup, more than
    sixty officers and civilians were executed in several cities of Iran in
    less than a month. Most of the officers were still active in the army and
    had not been swept away in the first wave of purges which took place in
    the army after the fall of the monarchy. Executions of individuals
    involved in the Nojeh coup continued in the months and years to come; at
    least 200 persons were executed in relations to the coup. Nureddin
    Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet
    communist party) mentioned the coup d’état in an article dated May 2, 2000
    posted on the Rah-e Tudeh website. Kianuri stressed the fact that the
    military branch of the Tudeh Party, which cooperated with the Islamic
    Republic’s authorities, discovered and “neutralized” the above mentioned
    Organization as well as other groups that planned a coup against the newly
    established regime. Arrest and detention The details of Mr. Irannejad’s
    arrest and detention is not known, other than he was arrested at 11 a.m.
    on July 10, 1980 in Combat Base No. 8 in Esfahan. Trial Based on the
    newspaper reports, the trial was held from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the
    Martial Islamic Revolutionary Court at Evin Prison. The deliberation
    amongst religious judges lasted an hour. Charges Collectively, Mr.
    Irannejad and three other defendants were charged with “plotting and
    participation in a coup d’état to be carried out on Thursday night,
    07/09/1980, against the Islamic Republic of Iran” and being “rebels
    against the sovereignty of Islam.” In the indictment, the Public
    Prosecutor said: “These enthusiasts of the Shah’s rotten, filthy, and
    reactionary regime, these supporters of the blood-thirsty American
    imperialism, had in mind to bring ‘American social democracy’ as a gift to
    the liberated people of Iran. They had in mind to re-asses the opinion of
    our heroic nation about the return of the royal system through a
    referendum…” The Public Prosecutor added: “This conspiracy was not planned
    in a vacuum and hence cannot be described in a single indictment; and
    these conspirators cannot be considered ordinary convicts… Considering
    that and by consulting the holy verses of the Koran regarding the
    punishment of the ‘rebel’ against the Islamic sovereign, it is imperative
    that the convicts receive their punishment according to the Shari’a law.”
    Evidence of guilt Based on the indictment, the evidences used against the
    defendants were as follows: “1. The defendants’ clear confessions
    regarding: a) plotting and intending a coup d’état to overthrow the
    Islamic Republic of Iran; b) having prepared 35-50 aircrafts for their
    operation and for bombing various densely-populated parts of several
    cities; c) intending to return the treacherous Bakhtiar to power if
    successful; d) having prepared printed leaflets to distribute among people
    and threaten to suppress any resistance in case their plan succeeded; e)
    having planned to take over military bases, the Mehrabad Airport, and the
    radio and television building; 2. Reports of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Guards Corps attached to the defendants’ files; 3. Statements of each
    defendant about the other defendants; 4. Other evidence, testimonies, and
    references in the files.” Defense No information is available regarding
    Mr. Irannejad’s defe
