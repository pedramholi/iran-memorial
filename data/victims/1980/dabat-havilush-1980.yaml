    According to Tehran newspaper Jomhuri Eslami, the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Ahvaz found Mr. Havilush Dabat guilty of "corruption on earth"
    allegedly for "leading the sabotage operation in the bombings of
    Sabzab-Andimeshk train and three oil pipelines in Shush". The communique
    from the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz claimed that Mr. Dabat
    died of "illness and mental discomfort" in prison a month and a half
    before the sentence was carried out about the rest of the "sabotage
    group". "However, since not all the members of the group were arrested
    then and further investigations were still under way, for judicial
    reasons, his death was kept secret until after the executions."
