circumstances: >
    The execution of Ms. GolBanu Rezayi was reported along with six others by
    the correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Sabzevar (August 23,
    1980). Arrest and detention There is no information available on Ms.
    Rezayi s arrest and detention in this report. Trial The report provided no
    information on Ms. Rezayi s trial. Charges Based on the report, the
    defendant was charged with adultery and drug-related offense. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report provided no information about the evidence presented against the
    defendant regarding the charge of adultery but indicated that she was
    arrested with one kilogram and five hundred grams of opium sap on her.
    Defense No information on the accused s defense is available. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sabzevar sentenced Ms. Rezayi to death.
    She was executed at dawn, three days after her trial.
