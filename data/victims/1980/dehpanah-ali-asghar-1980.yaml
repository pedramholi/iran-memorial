    The execution of Brigadier General Ali Asghar Dehpanah and 15 others was
    reported by the correspondents of the Jomhuri Eslami and Kayhan dailies in
    Shiraz (July 5, 1980). According to the Shiraz correspondent of the
    Enqelab Eslami daily of the same date, the religious judge who had
    attended the Friday Sermon in Shiraz spoke before performing the prayer
    while announcing the news: As I was busy examining the cases of drug
    dealers, the President asked me in a telephone conversation to examine the
    cases of first rate criminals with political charges and issue the verdict
    based on the Shari a law. I requested that the Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecutor of Shiraz give us what they have at the Revolutionary Tribunal.
    Unfortunately, these cases were not passed on to us, and therefore I
    sentenced five people to death based on what was available at the prison
    or the Islamic Revolutionary Guards headquarters, and considering the
    testimonies of witnesses and unbiased individuals. One or two of these
    five people were already tried at the court and sentenced to life
    imprisonment, but I sentenced them to death, considering the crimes they
    had committed; and I did not think it was even that necessary to examine
    their cases, anyway. The death sentence was carried out today at dawn, and
    this was my Islamic and human duty and I have done my job in accordance
    with Shari a standards. The report of the Friday Sermon speech points to
    the fact that these executions caused disagreement among the clerics. In
    response to his critic, the religious judge said: The gentleman who has
    been silent so far and has not shown the slightest reaction to the blood
    of our martyrs, has telephoned certain people last night, telling them
    that I have acted illegally. It must be said to him that it is none of his
    business. It would only be fair if I performed my duty to defrock this
    pseudo-cleric so that other pseudo-clerics do not dare present themselves
    against the Islamic nature of Iran. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this individual s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Based on
    the Jomhuri Eslami report, the religious judge traveled to Shiraz and,
    after visiting the Revolutionary Guard (Pasdaran) headquarters of Shiraz,
    headed for the Shiraz Tribunal, where he examined the cases of 16
    individuals charged with a range of crimes from killing and suppression of
    revolutionary combatants to drug dealing and sodomy. Brig. Gen. Dehpanah
    was one of the defendants. Charges The Jomhuri Eslami mentioned Brig. Gen.
    Dehpanah s charge as being a factor in the mass murder of Muslim people on
    February 11, 1979, adding that the number of people martyred in the
    clashes supervised by him reached 80. The Kayhan daily, however, specified
    that the defendant s charge had been active participation in suppressing
    people that resulted in 80 deaths and 470 injuries. Evidence of guilt The
    reports contain no information regarding the evidence presented against
    the defendant at the trial. Defense No information is available on the
    defendant s defense. Judgment The judge sentenced the defendant to death.
    The Jomhuri Eslami report specifies that the sentence included
    confiscation of property for six of the accused. It is not clear whether
    or not Brig. Gen. Dehpanah s properties were confiscated.
