    News of the murder of Ms. Leila Moradi was published in the Peykar
    publication, number 62, on July 7, 1980. According to this report, she was
    a high school student from Sanandaj. News of the murder of Ms. Leila
    Moradi was also published in the book "Az Armani ke Mijushad" by the
    sympathizers of the Peykar Organization in August of 1985. Ms. Moradi is
    one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of
    the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published
    on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of
    those members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979.
    More than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. The
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by
    a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest

    arrested during a demonstration against the occupation of Sanandaj by the
