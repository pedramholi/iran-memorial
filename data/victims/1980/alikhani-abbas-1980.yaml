circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Abbas Alikhani and two others was reported by the
    Pars News Agency correspondent in Sari. The report was published in the
    Jomhuri Eslami daily (August 24, 1980). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention
    There is no information available on the circumstances of Mr. Alikhani’s
    arrest and detention in this report. Trial The report provided no
    information on Mr. Alikhani’s trial. Charges Based on the report, the
    defendant was charged with “attacking Kelar Abad’s National Bank.” No
    specific information about the nature and outcomes of the attack was
    provided in the report. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    available on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No
    information on the accused’s defense is available. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Tonekabon sentenced Mr. Alikhani to death. He
    was executed immediately.
