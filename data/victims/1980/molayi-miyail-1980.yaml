    The execution of Mr. Milayil Molayi and another person was reported by the

    arrest and detention. Trial No information about the trial is available in
    the report. Charges Based on the report, the defendant s charges were as
    follows: repeated counts of sodomy, smuggling opium, and participation in
    stick-wielding for the Party of the Muslim People s Republic . The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentenced to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report did not provide any information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information on
    the accused s defense is available. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tabriz declared Mr. Molayi a corruptor on earth and sentenced
    him to death.
