circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ali Fathi, a cigarette vendor, was reported by the
    correspondent of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Isfahan (July 8, 1980) Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the circumstances of
    Mr. Fathi s trial. Charges Based on the report, the defendant was charged
    with sodomy. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Fathi s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Isfahan sentenced
    Mr. Fathi to death. Based on a report from the public relations office of
    the Revolutionary Guard headquarters quoted by the Jomhuri Eslami
    correspondent, Mr. Fathi was previously sentenced to one and a half years
    in prison for the same crime. He was acquitted after a few months, but
    since he continued his past activities, he finally received his deserved
    punishment.
