    sexual offenses”, “extramarital relationships”, “sodomy”, and “smuggling.”
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The communiqué does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Dad Mohammadi’s defense. Judgment Based on
    the communiqué, Mr. Dad Mohammadi was declared a “corruptor on earth.” He
    was sentenced to death.
