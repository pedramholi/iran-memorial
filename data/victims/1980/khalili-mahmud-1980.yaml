circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mahmud Khalili was reported by the correspondent of
    Jomhuri Eslami daily in Kerman (July 30, 1980). Arrest and detention The
    report mentioned that Mr. Khalili had been a fugitive for four months
    before he was arrested. Trial No information is available on the defendant
    s trial. Charges Based on the report, Mr. Khalili was charged with
    distributing and selling 100 grams of heroin and resistance against
    officials prior to and at the time of his arrest. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Khalili
    s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman found Mr.
    Khalili guilty of corruption on earth. He was shot to death at dawn.
