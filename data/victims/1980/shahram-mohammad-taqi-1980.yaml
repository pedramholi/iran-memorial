    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Taqi Shahram and 19 others was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily (July 24, 1980). The Jomhuri Eslami and Kayhan
    dailies published several reports concerning Mr. Shahram’s arrest and
    trial throughout the month of July. These reports present Mr. Shahram as a
    key leader in the People’s Mojahedin Organization who had played a
    significant role in shifting the Organization’s ideological orientation
    from Islamist to Marxist during the years 1973 to 1975. Additional
    information was sent to Omid via an electronic form, according to which
    Mr. Shahram held a masters degree in Mathematics from Tehran University.
    Arrest and detention The Jomhuri Eslami daily quoted a communiqué of the
    Central Revolutionary Committee in which Mr. Shahram was reported to have
    been arrested on a Tehran street on the night of July 3, 1980. Following
    the arrest by the Central Revolutionary Committee guards stationed at the
    Police Station # 8, the defendant was transferred to the headquarters of
    the Central Revolutionary Committee and immediately from there to the Qasr
    Prison. Trial Mr. Shahram’s trial started in the evening of Monday, July
    14, at the Special Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal in Tehran. Based on the
    Jomhuri Eslami report (July 15, 1980), media reporters, some of the
    families of the alleged victims, and the defendant’s family were present
    at the trial. A July 14 communiqué by the public relations office of the
    Chief Revolutionary Prosecutor of the Center (Tehran) encouraged the
    members of the People’s Mojahedin Organization to attend the trial “as
    spectators, plaintiffs, or witnesses.” However, the members of the named
    organization announced that they were prevented from attending the trial
    by the Revolutionary Tribunal and the management of the Evin Prison. The
    presiding judge refuted the claim of the Organization members. Mr. Shahram
    originally refused to attend his trial. He questioned the legitimacy of
    the trial and told the reporters that he demanded to be tried at an
    ordinary court as opposed to the Special Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal.
    The latter, he contended, was supposed to examine the cases of those who
    had cooperated with the former regime or been active against the Islamic
    Revolution and was, therefore, lacked competence with regards to his case.
    The presiding religious judge addressed the issue and explained that
    “since the defendant’s crime has not been without ideological, political,
    and social motivations, it is not possible to try him at a court for
    ordinary crimes.” He added: “The defendant is an Anti-Revolutionary. Not
    for his membership in Peykar and other Third Party organizations
    [referring to the Marxist groups that branched out of the original
    People’s Mojahedin Organization], of course, and not for issuing
    declarations such as the one in 1975 regarding the ideological shift of
    the People’s Mojahedin Organization in which opposition to Islam and to
    the Islamic movement is apparent. Not even because of his apostasy,
    although all of these could sufficiently prove his anti-revolutionary
    nature. This trial is held not to examine these issues, however. The
    defendant is an Anti-Revolutionary because he has ordered the murder of
    those who had combated the Arrogant Pahlavi regime in the path of Islam.
    The defendant and many of his likeminded leftist and deviant comrades are
    attempting to reduce the notion of the Anti-Revolutionary to those who
    have directly cooperated with the previous regimes, whereas in the eyes of
    the Revolutionary Prosecution all those who have gone against the Islamic
    nature of the Revolution directly or indirectly are considered
    Anti-Revolutionary, even if they have fought against the former regime.”
    After meeting with the media reporters during the recess and receiving a
    written warning from the presiding judge stating that the trial would be
    held in absentia, Mr. Shahram attended the second half of the trial. Once
    the indictment was read, he expressed his objection to the nature of the
    trial again. In response, the presiding judge said that the trial was
    approved by the people and, therefore, no further justification was needed
    for its legitimacy. Calling it “forced”, the defendant left the Tribunal
    in objection and did not attend the rest of the trial. The second session
    of the trial, in which neither the defendant nor his family were present,
    was held three days later, on July 16. Based on the Jomhuri Eslami report
    (July 17, 1980), before the prosecution began a letter, previously
    submitted to the presiding judge by the defendant’s sister, was read. In
    this letter, the defendant’s family had stated, as their reason for not
    attending the trial, the fact that it was not neutral and, therefore, not
    legal. The presiding judge, who was a Hezb e Jomhuri Eslami (Islamic
    Republic Party) candidate for the upcoming parliamentary elections at the
    time, refuted their statement on the basis that it was impossible to have
    an impartial judge after the Revolution: “Th
