    In November 2022, Zanyar Allahmoradi, a young worker from Sanandaj, was
    killed during a protest after being shot by security forces with both a
    pellet gun and a live round. Information regarding the arbitrary execution
    of Mr. Zanyar Allahmoradi, son of Rahim (Khalifeh Ebrahim) and Nasrin
    Ahmadi, was obtained from an ABC interview with an informed individual
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center on March 17, 2024.
    Additional information was gathered from reports published on the websites
    of Hengaw Organization for Human Rights (November 16, 2022) and Rouj News
    (February 6, 2023). Mr. Allahmoradi was born on November 24, 1997, into a
    hardworking, low-income family in Sanandaj, a city in Iran's Kurdistan
    Province. He was studying for an associate degree in electronics and
    planned to pursue a bachelor s degree in the same field. From a young age,
    he worked in construction, electrical wiring, rope work, and repairs. On
    February 23, 2022, he experienced a severe work accident caused by contact
    with high-voltage electricity. After hospitalization at Kosar Hospital in
    Sanandaj, doctors had to amputate his left hand. Despite this, he remained
    positive and told those around him, I am still able to work. One must be
    grateful to God. After the accident, he shifted to real estate and car
    sales. (ABC interview, March 17, 2024). People close to him describe him
    as calm, cheerful, optimistic, and sociable. They say he never lost hope,
    even during tough times, and always encouraged others to be patient and
    grateful. His friends considered him generous, assisting those in need
    whenever he could, and striving to bring happiness to those around him.
    (ABC interview) Following the death of Jina (Mahsa) Amini and the
    subsequent nationwide protests in fall 2022, Mr. Allahmoradi was deeply
    affected. According to a relative, he could not stay home and would say,
    "A Kurd-seller is taking away my sisters and brothers. I cannot remain
    silent." He participated in several protests in Sanandaj, and, according
    to his acquaintances, he helped injured protesters and prevented some
    individuals from being arrested during demonstrations. (ABC interview,
    March 17, 2024). Mr. Allahmoradi kept his involvement in the protests
    secret from his family to prevent causing them concern. A relative
    mentioned, "Zanyar never wished for anyone to be harmed. He always took
    the lead himself to protect others." After the demonstrations, he often
    appeared upset and expressed, "They are all my sisters and brothers. I
    cannot stand to see injustice." (ABC interview, March 17, 2024). A few
    days before his death, he spoke about plans to celebrate his birthday over
    the weekend. According to his family, he stayed hopeful until the very
    end, thought about the future, and, despite losing his left hand, never
    gave in to despair. (ABC interview, March 17, 2024). 2022 (Mahsa Amini)
    Protest background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in
    custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16,
    2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for
    improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The
    news of her death triggered protests, which started with a widespread
    expression of outrage on social media and the gathering of a large crowd
    in front of the hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan
    Province), where Mahsa was buried. Popular exasperation over the morality
    patrols and the veil in general, aggravated by misleading statements of
    the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s death and the impunity
    generally granted to state agents for the violence used against detainees
    led to months of nationwide protests. Initially led by young girls and
    women who burned their veils, and youth in general, protesters adopted the
    slogan Women, Life, Freedom, chanted during Amini s burial. The protest
    rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an
    end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was
    unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the morality police from the
    streets and preventative arrests of journalists and political and civil
    society activists did not stop the protests. By the end of December 2022,
    protests had taken place in about 164 cities and towns, including
    localities that had never witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities,
    high schools, businesses, and groups including oil workers, merchants of
    the Tehran bazaar (among others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom
    had been arrested as of February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even
    doctors joined these protests in various forms. Despite the violent
    crackdown and mass arrests, intense protests continued for weeks, at least
    through November 2022, with reports of sporadic activity continuing
    through the beginning of 2023. The State s crackdown was swift and
    accompanied by intermittent landline and cellular internet network
    shutdowns, as well as threats against and arrests of victim
