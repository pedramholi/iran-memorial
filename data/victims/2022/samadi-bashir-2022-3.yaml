    News of the execution of Mr. Bashir Samadi, along with 2 others*, was sent
    by an informed source to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center on March 15,
    2022. Mr. Bashir Samadi was married and had 4 daughters and 4 sons. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Samadi was detained in Adelabad prison on Shiraz. There
    is no further information regarding the circumstances of his arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on Mr. Samadi s trial.
    Charges According to the informed source, the charges against Mr. Samadi
    were announced as drug related . The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against Mr. Samadi. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Samadi s defense. Judgment There is no information on the
    verdict leading to this execution. Mr. Bashir Samadi was executed in
    Adelabad prison, in Shiraz on March 14, 2022. ----------------------- *
