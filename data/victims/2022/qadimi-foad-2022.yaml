    He loved soccer and he was a loyal fan of Esteqlal Soccer Team. He hoped
    his son who was in the Tehran Railway Football Club would move up to
    Esteqlal team and that he would play for the National Iranian Soccer Team.
    Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Mr. Fo ad Qadimi, son of
    Abdullah and Hadiqeh, was obtained from an interview with two close
    friends of his family (September 21, 2025 and September 24, 2024); and
    with a doctor who works at Kowsar Hopital in Sanandaj (February 18, 2023).
    Additional information was collected from websites of Islamic Republic of
    Iran News Agency IRNA (September 20 22, 2022), Radio and Television News
    Agency (September 22, 2022), Kurdistan Human Rights Network (March 30,
    2024), KURDPA Human Rights Organization (March 4, 2023), Hamshahri Online
    (September 23, 2022), Hengaw Human Rights Organization (September 21,
    2022), Iran Wire (September 21, 2022), Human Rights Monitor (October 5,
    2022). Mr. Qadimi was born on February 20, 1984, in the village of Qale
    Reyhaneh, near Divandarreh in Kurdistan Province. His family are Kurdish
    and they are Sunni. He was married and he had two children. Due to
    financial hardship, he was not able to stay in school past fifth grade. He
    knew how to sew, and he had a dry cleaners shop in Divandarreh since he
    was 17. According to two close friends of the family, he was a calm person
    with a sense of humor. He was generous, responsible, and he loved his
    family. He liked to travel, and he loved nature and hiking. Mr. Qadimi was
    very fond of soccer, and he was an avid fan of Esteqlal Soccer Team. He
    hoped his son who played for the Tehran Railway Football Club, would move
    up to Esteqlal Team and that he would play for the National Iranian Soccer
    Team someday. (Boroumand Center Interview with two close friends of his
    family (September 20 24, 2024). According to two knowledgeable sources,
    Mr. Qadimi was quite distressed by the news of Ms. Mahsa (Jina) Amini
    being killed, and he went to her funeral in Saqqez. As popular protest
    demonstrations against the killing of Ms. Mahsa Amini on September 16,
    2022, spread across Iranian cities, including Divandarreh, he participated
    in the anti-government demonstrations in this city on September 21, 2022
    (Center Interview, September 20 24, 2024). 2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest
    background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in custody of
    22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16, 2022. Amini
    had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for improper veiling on
    September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The news of her death
    triggered protests, which started with a widespread expression of outrage
    on social media and the gathering of a large crowd in front of the
    hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa
    was buried. Popular exasperation over the morality patrols and the veil in
    general, aggravated by misleading statements of the authorities regarding
    the cause of Mahsa s death and the impunity generally granted to state
    agents for the violence used against detainees led to months of nationwide
    protests. Initially led by young girls and women who burned their veils,
    and youth in general, protesters adopted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom,
    chanted during Amini s burial. The protest rapidly took on a clear
    anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an end to the Islamic
    Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was unprecedented. State
    efforts to withdraw the morality police from the streets and preventative
    arrests of journalists and political and civil society activists did not
    stop the protests. By the end of December 2022, protests had taken place
    in about 164 cities and towns, including localities that had never
    witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities, high schools, businesses,
    and groups including oil workers, merchants of the Tehran bazaar (among
    others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom had been arrested as of
    February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even doctors joined these
    protests in various forms. Despite the violent crackdown and mass arrests,
    intense protests continued for weeks, at least through November 2022, with
    reports of sporadic activity continuing through the beginning of 2023. The
    State s crackdown was swift and accompanied by intermittent landline and
    cellular internet network shutdowns, as well as threats against and
    arrests of victims family members, factors which posed a serious challenge
    to monitoring protests and documenting casualties. The security forces
    used illegal, excessive, and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and
    military assault rifles against protesters. They often targeted protesters
    heads and chests, shot them at close range, and in the back. Security
    forces have targeted faces with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to
    lose their eyesight, and according to some reports women s genitalia.
