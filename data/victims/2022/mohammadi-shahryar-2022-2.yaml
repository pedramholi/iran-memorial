    Shahryar Mohammadi had many dreams. One day, he got a tattoo that read I
    dream of dying without dreams. Joint explanation of the Kurdistan Human
    Rights Network (Network) and the "Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human
    Rights in Iran (ABC): This case is a part of the collaborative
    documentation of the Kurdistan Human Rights Network and the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center. The Kurdistan Human Rights Network intends to gradually
    document cases of extrajudicial executions of Kurdish citizens and
    activists. For this purpose, the network has used the experiences and
    research methodology of the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, which has been
    active in the field of documenting human rights violations in Iran for
    many years. The report of this case and subsequent reports will be
    published in the "documentation" section of the Kurdistan Human Rights
    Network website and the "Omid Memorial" of the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center. Some of the original and follow-up interviews used in this
    documentation were conducted by the Center, some by the Network, and some
    in collaboration. Information regarding the case of Mr. Shahryar
    Mohammadi, son of Ali and Mina, was obtained from interviews with two
    people close to the family (February 06, 2022 and June 22, 2023) and
    several interviews with informed sources; (from March to August 2023). To
    complete the information about this case, news was obtained from the
    websites of Voice of America s Persian division (February 6, 2023), Kurdpa
    (April 23, 2023), Kurdistan Media (December 28, 2022), BBC Persian s
    YouTube channel (April 15, 2023), Hana Human Rights Organization (April 1,
    2023), Iran Wire (April 25, 2023), Bultan News (April 26, 2023) and Tasnim
    News Agency (November 19, 2022).Mr. Shahryar Mohammadi was born on April
    25, 1994, into a Sunni Kurdish family in the city of Bukan in West
    Azerbaijan province. He spent his childhood, adolescence and youth in this
    city. After finishing high school, Mr. Mohammadi entered Bukan Azad
    University and studied architecture. According to his relatives, he
    studied until the second semester of university, but then dropped out due
    to the family's financial problems. Mr. Mohammadi was a kasebkar
    (tradesman)* transporting goods with his private car (interview with a
    family member, February 6, 2023).Mr. Mohammadi was interested in political
    activities and the Komala party. According to one of his relatives, in
    2014, after Mr. Mohammadi's car, which was his work vehicle, was seized by
    the government, he along with his friend Mohammad Hassanzadeh (who was
    killed during the 2022 protests) went to Iraqi Kurdistan to join the
    Komala party. After about five months, following threats from the security
    forces and their putting pressure on his family, Mr. Mohammadi abandoned
    his party activities and returned to Iran (interview with a family member,
    February 6, 2023). After returning to Iran, Mr. Mohammadi was repeatedly
    summoned and interrogated by security institutions such as the Information
    Ministry and the IRGC Information Organization (interview with a family
    member, February 6, 2023).One year after Mr. Mohammadi's return to Iran,
    following a report from unknown persons, security officers went to his
    family s home and took away his phone and computer RAM. They found
    pictures on Mr. Mohammadi's computer from the time when he was a (Komala)
    party member, showing him in Kurdish clothes and armed. This led to his
    arrest and the beginning of another round of interrogations. He was
    detained for about two months until the family managed to find his
    original interrogator to testify that Mr. Mohammadi's return to Iran was
    voluntary; he was then finally released on bail (interview with a family
    member, February 6, 2023).Relatives of Mr. Mohammadi describe him as a
    "very calm, kind, supportive" and "athletic, hard-working and caring
    youth." According to one of his close relatives, Mr. Mohammadi "was an
    athlete, he practiced martial arts and received an award in this field.
    [He] believed in freedom and equality between men and women from a young
    age, and was a staunch opponent of compulsory hijab. [He] used to exercise
    and told his friends he would open a gym if the regime changed. He wanted
    to open a mobile phone shop. He always said that he would build a complex
    and let the needy live in it. He was full of unfulfilled dreams" (BBC
    Persian YouTube channel, April 15, 2023). According to another relative,
    Mr. Mohammadi s "poverty and political beliefs did not allow Shahryar to
    have a comfortable life" (interview with an informed source, June 22,
    2023). A person close to Mr. Mohammadi's family said that he "had many
    dreams. One day, he got a tattoo that read I dream of dying without dreams
    Mr. Mohammadi used to work as a realtor before his death. (BBC Persian
    YouTube Channel, April 15, 2023).He was also known to people as a "noble,
    conscientious, and knowledgeable" person. Mr. Mohammadi cared about
    people's problems and helped solve them. A person who was close to Mr.
