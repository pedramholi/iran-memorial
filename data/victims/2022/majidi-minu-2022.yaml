  Minu Majidi was full of energy and life. Her kindness has made her a pilar in the family. She shared the pain of Jina (Mahsa) Amini and couldn t let the young protesters face danger alone. That evening, she separated from her husband to join protesters. Part of the information regarding the killing of Ms. Minu Majidi, daughter of Vahid Majidi and Vajiheh Qavidel, married mother of three children, was obtained through an interview conducted by the Boroumand Center with her daughter (Boroumand Center interview with Roya Pirai, February 7, 2023). Another part of the information in this case has been drawn from Ms. Mahsa Pirai s interview with Radio Zamaneh (December 6, 2022). The news of Ms. Majidi s extrajudicial killing has also been published in an Amnesty International report (September 21, 2022), Kurdistan Human Rights Organization s website (September 21, 2022), and Hengaw Human Rights Organization s website (September 22, 2022). Additional information in this case was obtained from Ms. Majidi s case file, as well as from the following websites: Zanan Nirooye Taghyir (Women Are Force For Change) (September 22, 2022); Voice of America (September 22, 2022; October 29, 2022); Iran International (September 22, 2022); Radio Farda (November 12, 2022); and Time Magazine (December 7, 2022). Ms. Minu Majidi was born on July 11, 1960, in the city of Qasr-e Shirin in Kermanshah Province. She spent her childhood as well as her adulthood in Kermanshah. Ms. Majidi was a graduate of the [city of] Tabriz Teacher Training Institute, where she obtained her Associate Degree in Teacher Training with a concentration in experimental sciences in 1981. According to her children, she was purged after the Cultural Revolution* and was not able to teach again; but she did teach table tennis for a while to the deaf and the hearing impaired. (Boroumand Center interview with Roya Piri, February 7, 2023; Radio Zamaneh, December 6, 2022). Ms. Majidi was concerned about political and social issues, and, according to her daughter, Roya Pirai, she always believed in freedom and cared about other human beings. She was kind to everybody and had a supportive personality . Ms. Pirai stated: My mother gave her life for what she believed in. She worked for freedom and was seeking justice for Mahsa [Amini] and the entire younger generation, people like myself. (Interview with Angelina Jolie, Time Magazine, December 7, 2022). Ms. Majidi also liked sports, literature, and for a while, horseback riding. She was full of energy and zest for life, and her unending kindness was the family s rock that we relied on. She shared Jina (Mahsa) Amini s mother s pain, and did not want to leave young protesters on their own in their struggle. She had gotten separated from her husband that evening to join the protesters. (Time Magazine website, December 7, 2022). Ms. Majidi was an ethnic Kurd born in a Sunni Moslem family, but was not religious. (Boroumand Center interview, February 7, 2023). At the time of her death, Ms. Majidi resided in Kermanshah. Three days after Mahsa (Jina) Amini s death, she took part in demonstrations to protest her killing. (Time Magazine, December 7, 2022). On the day of the incident, before getting separated from her husband and joining the protests, she had told him in response to his concern: If I don t go, and if you don t go [to the protests], and [only] people s children go and get killed, how would we dare say we had a revolution, once the [Islamic regime] falls? (Boroumand Center interview, February 7, 2023). 2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16, 2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The protests, which started in front of the hospital and continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa was buried, were triggered by popular exasperation over the morality patrols, misleading statements of the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s death and the resulting impunity for the violence used against detainees, as well as the mandatory veil in general. This protest, initially led by young girls and women who burned their veils and youth in general who chanted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom, rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the morality police from the streets and preventative arrests of journalists and political and civil society activists did not stop the protests. By the end of December 2022, protests had taken place in about 164 cities and towns, including localities that had never witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities, high schools, businesses, and groups including oil workers, merchants of the Tehran bazaar (among others), teachers, la
