    2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest background Nationwide protests were sparked by
    the death in custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on
    September 16, 2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality police in
    Tehran for improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead to the
    hospital. The news of her death triggered protests, which started with a
    widespread expression of outrage on social media and the gathering of a
    large crowd in front of the hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez
    (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa was buried. Popular exasperation over
    the morality patrols and the veil in general, aggravated by misleading
    statements of the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s death and the
    impunity generally granted to state agents for the violence used against
    detainees led to months of nationwide protests. Initially led by young
    girls and women who burned their veils, and youth in general, protesters
    adopted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom, chanted during Amini s burial.
    The protest rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with protesters
    calling for an end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and duration of the
    protest was unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the morality police
    from the streets and preventative arrests of journalists and political and
    civil society activists did not stop the protests. By the end of December
    2022, protests had taken place in about 164 cities and towns, including
    localities that had never witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities,
    high schools, businesses, and groups including oil workers, merchants of
    the Tehran bazaar (among others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom
    had been arrested as of February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even
    doctors joined these protests in various forms. Despite the violent
    crackdown and mass arrests, intense protests continued for weeks, at least
    through November 2022, with reports of sporadic activity continuing
    through the beginning of 2023. The State s crackdown was swift and
    accompanied by intermittent landline and cellular internet network
    shutdowns, as well as threats against and arrests of victims family
    members, factors which posed a serious challenge to monitoring protests
    and documenting casualties. The security forces used illegal, excessive,
    and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and military assault rifles
    against protesters. They often targeted protesters heads and chests, shot
    them at close range, and in the back. Security forces have targeted faces
    with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to lose their eyesight, and
    according to some reports women s genitalia. The bloodiest crackdown took
    place on September 30th in Zahedan, Baluchestan Province, where a protest
    began at the end of the Friday sermon. The death toll is reported to be
    above 90 for that day. Security forces shot protesters outside and
    worshipers inside the Mosala prayer hall. Many injured protesters, fearing
    arrest, did not go to hospitals where security forces have reportedly
    arrested injured protesters before and after they were treated. By
    February 1, 2023, the Human Rights Activists News Agency reported the
    number of recorded protests to be 1,262. The death toll, including
    protesters and passersby, stood at 527, of whom 71 were children. The
    number of arrests (including of wounded protesters) was estimated at a
    minimum at 22,000 , of whom 766 had already been tried and convicted. More
    than 100 protesters were at risk of capital punishment, and four had been
    executed in December 2022 and January 2023 without minimum standards of
    due process. Authorities also claimed 70 casualties among state forces,
    though there are consistent reports from families of killed protesters
    indicating authorities have pressured them or offered them rewards to
    falsely register their loved ones as such. Protesters, human rights
    groups, and the media have reported cases of beatings, torture (including
    to coerce confessions), and sexual assaults. Detainees have no access to
    lawyers during interrogations and their confessions are used in courts as
    evidence. Public support and international solidarity with protesters have
    also been unprecedented (the use of the hashtag #MahsaAmini in Farsi and
    English broke world records) and on November 24, 2022, the UN Human Rights
    Council adopted a resolution calling for the creation of a fact finding
    mission to Thoroughly and independently investigate alleged human rights
    violations in the Islamic Republic of Iran related to the protests that
    began on 16 September 2022, especially with respect to women and children.
