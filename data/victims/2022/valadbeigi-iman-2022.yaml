    Mr. Valadbeigi, a man of humor and jovial disposition, was not only a
    professional chess player but also a devoted enthusiast of the British
    rock band, Pink Floyd. He went missing after leaving his home during the
    "Woman, Life, Freedom" protests. Information about the enforced
    disappearance of Iman Valadbeigi, son of Mojtaba, a 42-year-old resident
    of Tehran, was taken from the Telegram channel of Iran International TV
    (January 8, 2023). Additional information was obtained from an interview
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC) with an informed
    person (September 8, 2024), Etemad newspaper (March 14, 2023 and December
    31, 2023), IranWire (July 20 and February 20, 2024), and the Iran
    International website (July 10, 2024). According to his official birth
    certificate, Iman Valadbeigi was born on May 1, 1981, but he was actually
    born on March 8, 1982, in the city of Isfahan. Mr. Valadbeigi held a
    degree in mechanical engineering and worked professionally at an
    engineering firm on Sohrevardi Street in Tehran. According to an informed
    source, he played chess professionally and was deeply interested in the
    music of Pink Floyd, the legendary British rock band of the 1970s and
    1980s. He also enjoyed writing personal diaries. Those close to him
    remember him as a unique blend of gentleness and wit - someone whose sharp
    sense of humor and playful banter left a lasting impression. (ABC
    Interview, September 8, 2024) According to his father, Iman was critical
    of government policies and actively participated in the 2022 "Woman, Life,
    Freedom" protests. He spoke openly to those around him about his political
    demands and the events he witnessed during the protests. "Every night,
    Iman would sit across from me and talk about what he wanted," his father
    recalled. "He would tell me how he had peacefully joined the protests on
    this street or that street. He even shared the details of his presence at
    the protests" (Etemad newspaper, March 14, 2023) 2022 (Mahsa Amini)
    Protest background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in
    custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16,
    2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for
    improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The
    protests, which started in front of the hospital and continued in the city
    of Saqqez (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa was buried, were triggered by
    popular exasperation over the morality patrols, misleading statements of
    the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s death and the resulting
    impunity for the violence used against detainees, as well as the mandatory
    veil in general. This protest, initially led by young girls and women who
    burned their veils and youth in general who chanted the slogan Women,
    Life, Freedom, rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with protesters
    calling for an end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and duration of the
    protest was unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the morality police
    from the streets and preventative arrests of journalists and political and
    civil society activists did not stop the protests. By the end of December
    2022, protests had taken place in about 164 cities and towns, including
    localities that had never witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities,
    high schools, businesses, and groups including oil workers, merchants of
    the Tehran bazaar (among others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom
    had been arrested as of February 1st, 2023), artists, athletes, and even
    doctors joined these protests in various forms. Despite the violent
    crackdown and mass arrests, intense protests continued for weeks, at least
    through November 2022, with reports of sporadic activity continuing
    through the beginning of 2023. The State s crackdown was swift and
    accompanied by intermittent landline and cellular internet network
    shutdowns, as well as threats against and arrests of victims family
    members, factors which posed a serious challenge to monitoring protests
    and documenting casualties. The security forces used illegal, excessive,
    and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and military assault rifles
    against protesters. They often targeted protesters heads and chests, shot
    them at close range, and in the back. Security forces have targeted faces
    with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to lose their eyesight, and
    according to some reports women s genitalia. The bloodiest crackdown took
    place on September 30th in Zahedan, Baluchestan Province, where a protest
    began at the end of the Friday sermon. The death toll is reported to be
    above 90 for that day. Many injured protesters, fearing arrest, did not go
    to hospitals where security forces have reportedly arrested injured
    protesters before and after they were treated. By February 1, 2023, the
    Human Rights Activists News Agency reported the number of recorded
    protests to be 1,262. The death toll, including protesters and passersby,
    stood at 527, of whom 71 were children. The number of arr
