    Ms. Sheikheh s child asked her many times to come back inside the house,
    but her mind was made up. When the young people are in the streets, I
    cannot stay at home. Information regarding the life of Ms. Kobra Sheikheh
    Saqa, known as Nanny Kobra , daughter of Karim and Ayesheh, and regarding
    her arbitrary execution was obtained from an Abdorrahman Boroumand Center
    Interview with an informed source (January 16, 2023). In order to complete
    the Hope Memorial for Ms. Sheikheh, information has been taken from Kurdpa
    Website (October 27 and November 5, 2022), Radio Farda (August 24, 2023),
    BBC Farsi (September 2, 2023), and her Death Certificate (November 5,
    2022). According to available information, Ms. Sheikheh Saqa was born in
    the village of Molla Kandi, in the environs of Miandoab, West Azerbaijan
    Province, on July 25, 1963. She was married at 13, and she gave birth to
    four children. Ms. Sheikheh was a housewife and she helped her husband on
    their farm with agriculture and animal husbandry. She participated in the
    Literacy Campaign, and she lived with her family on Kargar Street in
    Mahabad (Boroumand Center Interview, January 16, 2023). One of Ms.
    Sheikheh Saqa s relatives described her as a hardworking and
    long-suffering woman, who nevertheless always had a loving smile on her
    lips (Radio Farda, August 24, 2023). According to her relatives, in
    following the news about the death of Mahsa Amini, Ms. Sheikheh had said
    many times, Would that God would ordain such a death for one. Look what
    people are doing for her. Ms. Sheikheh Saqa attended the protests
    following the death of Mahsa Amini on October 27, 2022. 2022 (Mahsa Amini)
    Protest background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in
    custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16,
    2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for
    improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The
    news of her death triggered protests, which started with a widespread
    expression of outrage on social media and the gathering of a large crowd
    in front of the hospital, continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan
    Province), where Mahsa was buried. Popular exasperation over the morality
    patrols and the veil in general, aggravated by misleading statements of
    the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s death and the impunity
    generally granted to state agents for the violence used against detainees
    led to months of nationwide protests. Initially led by young girls and
    women who burned their veils, and youth in general, protesters adopted the
    slogan Women, Life, Freedom, chanted during Amini s burial. The protest
    rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an
    end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was
    unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the morality police from the
    streets and preventative arrests of journalists and political and civil
    society activists did not stop the protests. By the end of December 2022,
    protests had taken place in about 164 cities and towns, including
    localities that had never witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities,
    high schools, businesses, and groups including oil workers, merchants of
    the Tehran bazaar (among others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom
    had been arrested as of February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even
    doctors joined these protests in various forms. Despite the violent
    crackdown and mass arrests, intense protests continued for weeks, at least
    through November 2022, with reports of sporadic activity continuing
    through the beginning of 2023. The State s crackdown was swift and
    accompanied by intermittent landline and cellular internet network
    shutdowns, as well as threats against and arrests of victims family
    members, factors which posed a serious challenge to monitoring protests
    and documenting casualties. The security forces used illegal, excessive,
    and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and military assault rifles
    against protesters. They often targeted protesters heads and chests, shot
    them at close range, and in the back. Security forces have targeted faces
    with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to lose their eyesight, and
    according to some reports women s genitalia. The bloodiest crackdown took
    place on September 30th in Zahedan, Baluchestan Province, where a protest
    began at the end of the Friday sermon. The death toll is reported to be
    above 90 for that day. Security forces shot protesters outside and
    worshipers inside the Mosala prayer hall. Many injured protesters, fearing
    arrest, did not go to hospitals where security forces have reportedly
    arrested injured protesters before and after they were treated. By
    February 1, 2023, the Human Rights Activists News Agency reported the
    number of recorded protests to be 1,262. The death toll, including
    protesters and passersby, stood at 527, of whom 71 were children. The
    number of arrests (including of wounded protesters) was estimated at a min
