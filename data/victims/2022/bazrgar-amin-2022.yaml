    Mr. Bazrgar: "Our silence is betrayal!" Information regarding the
    extrajudicial execution of Mr. Amin Bazrgar, son of Mas'ud, was obtained
    from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC) with
    Ebrahim Es'haqi, a fellow athlete and friend of Mr. Bazrgar (July 24,
    2023). Additional details were gathered from the following sources: Radio
    Farda website (October 14, 2022, November 30, 2023), Iran International TV
    YouTube channel (July 20, 2023), 1500 Tasvir X account (January 24, 2022,
    February 25, 2022), Sardar Pasha'i X account (January 24, 2022), BBC
    Persian (October 14, 2022), Radio Zamaneh (May 6, 2024), IranWire (October
    16, 2022, August 9, 2023), Kayhan London (October 14, 2022), and IRIB News
    Agency (November 17, 2018). Amin Bazrgar was born in Shiraz on February 5,
    1994. (Interview with Ebrahim Es'haqi, July 24, 2023). He took over some
    of the family's financial responsibilities after losing his father at a
    young age. Mr. Bazrgar was a carpenter and worked in a wood factory. He
    started wrestling as a teenager and became a professional wrestler. Since
    2015, he has represented Fars Province in national team selection
    competitions (Interview with Ebrahim Es'haqi, July 24, 2023; Radio Farda,
    November 30, 2023) and won a bronze medal in the 66 kg weight class at the
    2018 national wrestling championships (IRIB News Agency, November 17,
    2018; Interview with Ebrahim Es'haqi, July 24, 2023). He last competed in
    the 2021 Takhti International Cup, where he placed third in the 67 kg
    weight class (Radio Farda, November 30, 2023). Mr. Bazrgar was a friend
    and training partner of Navid Afkari, a protester during the Iranian
    demonstrations in August 2018, who was later executed by the Islamic
    Republic. Navid Afkari's execution had a deep impact on Amin Bazrgar.
    According to Ebrahim Es'haqi, a wrestler and close friend of Amin Bazrgar,
    after Navid's execution, Amin frequently talked about him on social media
    and in sports communities. He even set Navid's photo as the wallpaper on
    his cell phone. (Interview with Ebrahim Es'haqi, July 24, 2024; Iran
    International TV YouTube channel, July 20, 2023). Amin Bazrgar's last
    Instagram post was also from the days after Navid Afkari's execution. He
    shared a photo of Navid with the caption, "Silence is betrayal" (Amin
    Bazrgar's Instagram page, ABC's archive). Amin's last Instagram story
    showed a clenched fist rising from flames, and he tagged Navid Afkari's
    account. (Radio Farda, November 30, 2023)." According to Ebrahim Es'haqi,
    "Everyone knew that he was a close friend of Navid Afkari. After Navid's
    tragic destiny, Amin was the only athlete in Shiraz who consistently
    supported Navid through his posts and statements." (IranWire, August 9,
    2023). Reports indicate that in the months following Navid Afkari's
    execution, Mr. Bazrgar often carried a can of spray paint in his backpack.
    He used it to write slogans protesting Afkari's execution on the street
    walls. His slogans emphasized one phrase: "Our silence is a betrayal -
    Navid Afkari. These activities had a significant impact on Amin Bazrgar's
    daily life. He stopped attending wrestling practice and stopped going to
    work. In addition to professional wrestling, Mr. Bazrgar was interested in
    other sports such as hiking and bodybuilding. (Interview with Ebrahim
    Es'haqi, July 24, 2024). Mr. Morteza Hadidi, another friend and club-mate
    of Mr. Bazrgar, described Amin's character, emphasizing his supportive
    nature: "You were a champion, always embodied honesty, knowledge, and
    selflessness; you were and always will be our captain. (Radio Zamaneh, May
    6, 2024). Ebrahim Es'haqi also described him as a "cheerful" person who
    enjoyed "dancing and singing" and someone who remained loyal to his
    friends. According to Es'haqi, "Amin was not a religious person, but he
    believed in God and his religion was humanity; he considered nothing above
    humanity. (Interview with Ebrahim Es'haqi, July 24, 2024)". Background of
    Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic
    Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated violence in
    Iran and around the world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic
    operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in kidnapping,
    disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose activities
    they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial
    killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders began in
    February 1979 and have continued since then, both inside and outside Iran.
    The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings
    outside Iran attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have
    been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
    in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France,
    Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in
    Europe; and the United States
