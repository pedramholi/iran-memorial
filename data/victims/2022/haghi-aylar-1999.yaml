    Haghi participated in the anti-government protest that took place in Tabriz
    on November 16, 2022, as part of the 2022 Iran protests. Government forces
    began to disperse the demonstration by using violence against the
    demonstrators. After the intervention of the police, Haghi took refuge in a
    building to escape the violence. Several officers who were chasing her
    followed her into the building and shot her in the back of the head, killing
    her. Her body was then thrown from a high-rise building.
