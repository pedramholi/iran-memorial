    Mr. Fo'ad Mohammadi believed in gender equality and held that a society
    can only be free when its women are free. Information regarding the
    arbitrary execution of Fo'ad Mohammadi, the son of Hajar and Esma'il, was
    gathered from multiple sources, including the Kurdistan Human Rights
    Network (November 16 and 19, 2022), Hengaw (November 16, 2022), Kurdpa
    (November 16, 2022, and November 15, 2023), Radio Zamaneh (November 16,
    2022), BBC Persian (November 16, 2022), Jina Women's News Agency (November
    16, 2022), Kolbar News Telegram channel (November 16, 2022, and March 8,
    2024), IranWire s Twitter account (November 16, 2022), and the Iranian
    state news agencies IRNA (November 15 and 17, 2022) and Tasnim (November
    16, 2022). Fo'ad Mohammadi was born in 1980 in the village of Mavian, near
    Kamyaran, Kurdistan Province. He was married with two children and ran a
    mobile repair and sales shop in Kamyaran's "Tejarat" shopping center
    (Kurdistan Human Rights Network, November 16, 2022; Hengaw, November 16,
    2022). There is little information about Mr. Mohammadi's life and
    activities. However, during his 40-day memorial, which was attended by a
    large crowd chanting "Martyr Fo'ad will never die," his wife gave a
    heartfelt tribute, saying: "My dear, you stood for equality between men
    and women and always said that society can never be free until women are
    free. My love, you stood against exploiting workers and reminded us that
    'we build houses for others but have none for ourselves. (Burial ceremony

    background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in custody of
    22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16, 2022. Amini
    had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for improper veiling on
    September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The news of her death
    triggered protests, which started with a widespread expression of outrage
    on social media and the gathering of a large crowd in front of the
    hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa
    was buried. Popular exasperation over the morality patrols and the veil in
    general, aggravated by misleading statements of the authorities regarding
    the cause of Mahsa s death and the impunity generally granted to state
    agents for the violence used against detainees led to months of nationwide
    protests. Initially led by young girls and women who burned their veils,
    and youth in general, protesters adopted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom,
    chanted during Amini s burial. The protest rapidly took on a clear
    anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an end to the Islamic
    Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was unprecedented. State
    efforts to withdraw the morality police from the streets and preventative
    arrests of journalists and political and civil society activists did not
    stop the protests. By the end of December 2022, protests had taken place
    in about 164 cities and towns, including localities that had never
    witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities, high schools, businesses,
    and groups including oil workers, merchants of the Tehran bazaar (among
    others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom had been arrested as of
    February 1st, 2023), artists, athletes, and even doctors joined these
    protests in various forms. Despite the violent crackdown and mass arrests,
    intense protests continued for weeks, at least through November 2022, with
    reports of sporadic activity continuing through the beginning of 2023. The
    State s crackdown was swift and accompanied by intermittent landline and
    cellular internet network shutdowns, as well as threats against and
    arrests of victims family members, factors which posed a serious challenge
    to monitoring protests and documenting casualties. The security forces
    used illegal, excessive, and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and
    military assault rifles against protesters. They often targeted protesters
    heads and chests, shot them at close range, and in the back. Security
    forces have targeted faces with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to
    lose their eyesight, and according to some reports women s genitalia. The
    bloodiest crackdown took place on September 30th in Zahedan, Baluchestan
    Province, where a protest began at the end of the Friday sermon. The death
    toll is reported to be above 90 for that day. Security forces shot
    protesters outside and worshipers inside the Mosala prayer hall. Many
    injured protesters, fearing arrest, did not go to hospitals where security
    forces have reportedly arrested injured protesters before and after they
    were treated. By February 1, 2023, the Human Rights Activists News Agency
    reported the number of recorded protests to be 1,262. The death toll,
    including protesters and passersby, stood at 527, of whom 71 were
    children. The number of arrests (including of wounded protesters) was
    estimated at a minimum at 22,000 , of whom 766 had already been tried and
    convicted. More than 10
