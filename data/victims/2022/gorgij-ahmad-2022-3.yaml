    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad Gorgij, along with 2 others*, was sent
    by an informed source to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center on March 15,
    2022. Mr. Ahmad Gorgij was 38 years old and single. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Gorgij was detained in Adelabad prison on Shiraz. There is no further
    information regarding the circumstances of his arrest and detention. Trial
    No information is available on Mr. Gorgij s trial. Charges According to
    the informed source, the charges against Mr. Gorgij were announced as drug
    related . The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Gorgij. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Gorgij s defense. Judgment There is no information on the verdict
    leading to this execution. Mr. Ahmad Gorgij was executed in Adelabad
    prison, in Shiraz on March 14, 2022. ----------------------- * Mr. Bashir
