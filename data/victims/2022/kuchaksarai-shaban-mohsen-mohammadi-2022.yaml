    Mohsen had a deep sense of patriotism. He dreamed of celebrating Nowruz
    beside the tomb of Cyrus the Great. Information regarding the arbitrary
    execution of Mr. Sha ban (Mohsen) Mohammadi Kuchaksara i was obtained from
    an interview with a family acquaintance conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center (ABC) on April 10, 2023. Additional information was taken
    from reports published by BBC Persian on October 2, 2023; Radio Zamaneh on
    September 30, 2022; IranWire on November 14, 2022 and September 25, 2024;
    and two videos published on the Channel Jadid website on September 21,
    2023 and 2024. According to the available information, Mr. Mohsen
    Mohammadi Kuchaksara i was born on May 7, 1985, and lived in Qaemshahr. He
    was the second of five children, was married, and was the father of two
    sons, aged five and eleven. He was a building electrician and master
    craftsman who dedicated himself day and night to his clients, despite
    having several apprentices. He often worked for free for low-income
    families and paid for their equipment and medicine himself. (BBC Persian,
    October 2, 2023; ABC interview, April 10, 2023). Mr. Mohammadi Kuchaksara
    i was described as a kind, social, and active person. He loved nature and
    enjoyed football and volleyball. He was a devoted fan of Esteghlal FC and
    Nassaji Mazandaran FC. He was always present at picnics and outings with
    family and friends. He often said: "No one has seen tomorrow; we must live
    in the moment." (ABC interview, April 10, 2023). He was deeply interested
    in ancient Iranian culture. He dreamed of celebrating Nowruz beside the
    tomb of Cyrus the Great. On one occasion, when he found the entrance
    blocked by security agents, he angrily protested. "Mohsen was very
    sensitive about such issues and always carried a strong sense of
    patriotism." (ABC interview, April 10, 2023). He candidly spoke out about
    those killed in the protests. A few days after Mahsa (Jina) Amini's death,
    he told his family: "Mahsa Amini also had parents, and this happened to
    all of them. Must we lose a loved one before we realize what is
    happening?" (ABC interview, April 10, 2023). On Wednesday, September 21,
    2022, Mr. Mohammadi Kuchaksara i participated in nationwide protests in
    Qaemshahr, Mazandaran Province. 2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest background
    Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in custody of 22-year old
    Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16, 2022. Amini had been
    arrested by the morality police in Tehran for improper veiling on
    September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The news of her death
    triggered protests, which started with a widespread expression of outrage
    on social media and the gathering of a large crowd in front of the
    hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa
    was buried. Popular exasperation over the morality patrols and the veil in
    general, aggravated by misleading statements of the authorities regarding
    the cause of Mahsa s death and the impunity generally granted to state
    agents for the violence used against detainees led to months of nationwide
    protests. Initially led by young girls and women who burned their veils,
    and youth in general, protesters adopted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom,
    chanted during Amini s burial. The protest rapidly took on a clear
    anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an end to the Islamic
    Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was unprecedented. State
    efforts to withdraw the morality police from the streets and preventative
    arrests of journalists and political and civil society activists did not
    stop the protests. By the end of December 2022, protests had taken place
    in about 164 cities and towns, including localities that had never
    witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities, high schools, businesses,
    and groups including oil workers, merchants of the Tehran bazaar (among
    others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom had been arrested as of
    February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even doctors joined these
    protests in various forms. Despite the violent crackdown and mass arrests,
    intense protests continued for weeks, at least through November 2022, with
    reports of sporadic activity continuing through the beginning of 2023. The
    State s crackdown was swift and accompanied by intermittent landline and
    cellular internet network shutdowns, as well as threats against and
    arrests of victims family members, factors which posed a serious challenge
    to monitoring protests and documenting casualties. The security forces
    used illegal, excessive, and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and
    military assault rifles against protesters. They often targeted protesters
    heads and chests, shot them at close range, and in the back. Security
    forces have targeted faces with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to
    lose their eyesight, and according to some reports women s genitalia.
