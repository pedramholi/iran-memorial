    When the family went to the cemetery and saw Mr. Mahmudi s body, they
    realized the body was still covered in blood and it had not been kept at
    the morgue since the time of his death, as is customary. Information about
    the arbitrary execution of Mr. Fereidun Mahmudi, son of Ahmad Mahmudi and
    Maliheh Mehrpur, was obtained through an interview by Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center with his relatives (April 13, 2023). Additional
    information to complete this file was taken from Kurdistan Human Rights
    Network websites (August 22, 2023), Kordpa (April 21, 2023), Radio Zamaneh
    (April 25, 2023), Radio Farda (August 14, 2023), Iran Wire (October 28,
    2022), Zan News Agency (August 25, 2023), HRANA (April 22, 2023), and
    existing documents in the archives of Boroumand Center. Mr. Mahmudi was
    born on February 10, 1991, in the Upper Baharestan (Hamalava) neighborhood
    in Saqqez. He spent his childhood in this town and he went to school until
    the end of eighth grade. After that, he had to leave school and enter the
    work force, in order to help his family make a living. At that time they
    left their hometown in order to go to work at a brick making operation.
    After a while, Mr. Mahmudi returned to Saqqez and went to work as a tile
    worker and plasterer. His last job was installing armature in buildings
    (Boroumand ABC's interview with relatives, April 13, 2023). Mr. Mahmudi
    was married and he had a small child. He loved his family. He had a quiet
    personality and he was kind. He was healthy and he took care of his
    health. He liked to watch soccer games and he followed the news about this
    sport (ABC's interview with family, April 13, 2023; Radio Zamaneh, April
    25, 2023). In August 2022, when Jina (Mahsa) Amini was killed in a police
    station in Tehran, Mr. Mahmudi was horrified and deeply disturbed .
    According to a family member, when Mr. Mahmudi heard that Ms. Amini had
    been killed because of her hijab, he repeatedly asked, How is it possible
    that someone who had an acceptable hijab and who was traveling with her
    brother, was killed through no fault of her own and her body was then
    handed over to her family? (ABC's interview with a relative, April 13,
    2023). 2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest background Nationwide protests were
    sparked by the death in custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa)
    Amini on September 16, 2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality
    police in Tehran for improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead
    to the hospital. The news of her death triggered protests, which started
    with a widespread expression of outrage on social media and the gathering
    of a large crowd in front of the hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez
    (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa was buried. Popular exasperation over
    the morality patrols and the veil in general, aggravated by misleading
    statements of the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s death and the
    impunity generally granted to state agents for the violence used against
    detainees led to months of nationwide protests. Initially led by young
    girls and women who burned their veils, and youth in general, protesters
    adopted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom, chanted during Amini s burial.
    The protest rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with protesters
    calling for an end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and duration of the
    protest was unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the morality police
    from the streets and preventative arrests of journalists and political and
    civil society activists did not stop the protests. By the end of December
    2022, protests had taken place in about 164 cities and towns, including
    localities that had never witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities,
    high schools, businesses, and groups including oil workers, merchants of
    the Tehran bazaar (among others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom
    had been arrested as of February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even
    doctors joined these protests in various forms. Despite the violent
    crackdown and mass arrests, intense protests continued for weeks, at least
    through November 2022, with reports of sporadic activity continuing
    through the beginning of 2023. The State s crackdown was swift and
    accompanied by intermittent landline and cellular internet network
    shutdowns, as well as threats against and arrests of victims family
    members, factors which posed a serious challenge to monitoring protests
    and documenting casualties. The security forces used illegal, excessive,
    and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and military assault rifles
    against protesters. They often targeted protesters heads and chests, shot
    them at close range, and in the back. Security forces have targeted faces
    with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to lose their eyesight, and
    according to some reports women s genitalia. The bloodiest crackdown took
    place on September 30th in Zahedan, Baluchestan Province, where a protest
    began at the end of the Friday sermon. The death toll is reported to be
    above 90 for that day.
