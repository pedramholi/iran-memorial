    He told his mother, If people like me don t go, who will stand up against
    all this injustice? Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Rahim
    Kelij, son of Anbia and Rajab Ali, was obtained through two interviews
    with an informed person conducted by ABC on August 25, 2024, and August
    16, 2025. Additional information was gathered from his death certificate
    (November 8, 2022), burial permit (September 22, 2022), the HRANA News
    Agency (December 9, 2022), Radio Zamaneh (September 26, 2023), and BBC
    Persian Television (September 22, 2024). Mr. Rahim Kelij was an unmarried
    man born on February 7, 1995, in Qaemshahr, Mazandaran Province. He was
    the only son in his family. He had earned an associate degree in computer
    software engineering from Mohammad Baqer University in Sari, and he owned
    a mobile phone repair shop in Qaemshahr. Mr. Kelij was an optimistic young
    man who looked to the future with hope. According to an informed source,
    he was "athletic, brave, generous, and a nature lover." (ABC interview
    with an informed individual, August 25, 2024). He loved animals,
    especially dogs, and had raised many since childhood. Sita, his last dog,
    was deeply attached to him. Cheerful by nature, he had trained
    professionally in bodybuilding until about a year before his death (Radio
    Zamaneh, September 26, 2023). In his personal notebook, Rahim wrote: "I
    will be a successful person I'm sure of it. I m at peace and handle all my
    problems calmly. I m a happy person. All this stress will pass, and one
    day these stories will end. I will become a successful man. One day, I ll
    be the best LCD repairman in Qaemshahr. In early September 2022, he took a
    photo of himself standing between two painted wings on a wall. He posted
    the photo on his Instagram account with the caption: "I have become a
    phoenix rising from the bright ashes of a burned generation." Because of
    this post, he became known as the "Phoenix of Iran." (ABC interview with
    an informed individual, August 25, 2024; Radio Zamaneh, September 26,
    2023). Following Mahsa Amini's death on September 16, 2022, protests
    erupted across Iran, including in Qaemshahr. On September 20, Rahim told
    his mother that demonstrations had taken place in Sari the night before
    and that he would have attended if he had known earlier. Despite their
    efforts to keep him from participating in the upcoming protests, his
    family failed. He told his mother, "If people like me don't stand up, who
    will?" (Radio Zamaneh, September 26, 2023; BBC Persian, September 22,
    2024). On September 21, 2022, Rahim left his shop in downtown Qaemshahr to
    join the protests. Wearing a white shirt, he stood at the front line.
    According to his friends, he was "very happy and clapping." Later that
    evening, when his family tried to reach him, his phone was already off.
    (Radio Zamaneh, September 26, 2023) 2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest background
    Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in custody of 22-year old
    Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16, 2022. Amini had been
    arrested by the morality police in Tehran for improper veiling on
    September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The news of her death
    triggered protests, which started with a widespread expression of outrage
    on social media and the gathering of a large crowd in front of the
    hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa
    was buried. Popular exasperation over the morality patrols and the veil in
    general, aggravated by misleading statements of the authorities regarding
    the cause of Mahsa s death and the impunity generally granted to state
    agents for the violence used against detainees led to months of nationwide
    protests. Initially led by young girls and women who burned their veils,
    and youth in general, protesters adopted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom,
    chanted during Amini s burial. The protest rapidly took on a clear
    anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an end to the Islamic
    Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was unprecedented. State
    efforts to withdraw the morality police from the streets and preventative
    arrests of journalists and political and civil society activists did not
    stop the protests. By the end of December 2022, protests had taken place
    in about 164 cities and towns, including localities that had never
    witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities, high schools, businesses,
    and groups including oil workers, merchants of the Tehran bazaar (among
    others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom had been arrested as of
    February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even doctors joined these
    protests in various forms. Despite the violent crackdown and mass arrests,
    intense protests continued for weeks, at least through November 2022, with
    reports of sporadic activity continuing through the beginning of 2023. The
    State s crackdown was swift and accompanied by intermittent landline and
    cellular internet network shutdowns, as well as threats against and
    arrests of victims family me
