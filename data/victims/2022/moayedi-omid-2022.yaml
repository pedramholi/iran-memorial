    Omid Mo'ayedi was fatally shot by security forces while trying to help a
    protester. Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Omid Mo'ayedi,
    son of Hamid and Farzaneh, was obtained through an ABC interview with an
    informed person on May 16, 2025. Additional information was gathered from
    the websites of Mehr News Agency (November 19, 2022), Eghtesad News
    (November 21, 2022), Tasnim News Agency (November 21, 2022), Young
    Journalists Club (November 22, 2022), Radio Farda (December 6, 2022), and
    Iran International (December 23, 2022; September 17, 2025). Omid Mo'ayedi
    was born in Shiraz on May 22, 2002 and has spent his entire life in the
    city. Since childhood, he has had a keen interest in football and managed
    to join the Vesal Shiraz youth football team. After graduating from high
    school, he pursued a degree in physical education at Shiraz University.
    While studying, he worked with his father in the field of traditional
    mirror making and interior design. Those who knew him described him as a
    "polite and decent" young man. (ABC interview with an informed person, May
    16, 2025) Mr. Mo'ayedi was critical of the political and social situation
    in Iran. He had participated in the November 2019 protests sparked by fuel
    price hikes. After the murder of Mahsa Amini and the start of nationwide
    protests, he became actively involved. The murder of Nika Shakarami
    particularly affected and angered him. (ABC Interview with an Informed
    Person, May 16, 2025) He was part of a family of four and had a brother
    named Navid. 2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest background Nationwide protests
    were sparked by the death in custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina
    (Mahsa) Amini on September 16, 2022. Amini had been arrested by the
    morality police in Tehran for improper veiling on September 13 and sent
    brain dead to the hospital. The news of her death triggered protests,
    which started with a widespread expression of outrage on social media and
    the gathering of a large crowd in front of the hospital,continued in the
    city of Saqqez (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa was buried. Popular
    exasperation over the morality patrols and the veil in general, aggravated
    by misleading statements of the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s
    death and the impunity generally granted to state agents for the violence
    used against detainees led to months of nationwide protests. Initially led
    by young girls and women who burned their veils, and youth in general,
    protesters adopted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom, chanted during Amini s
    burial. The protest rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with
    protesters calling for an end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and
    duration of the protest was unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the
    morality police from the streets and preventative arrests of journalists
    and political and civil society activists did not stop the protests. By
    the end of December 2022, protests had taken place in about 164 cities and
    towns, including localities that had never witnessed protests. Close to
    150 universities, high schools, businesses, and groups including oil
    workers, merchants of the Tehran bazaar (among others), teachers, lawyers
    (at least 49 of whom had been arrested as of February 1 st , 2023),
    artists, athletes, and even doctors joined these protests in various
    forms. Despite the violent crackdown and mass arrests, intense protests
    continued for weeks, at least through November 2022, with reports of
    sporadic activity continuing through the beginning of 2023. The State s
    crackdown was swift and accompanied by intermittent landline and cellular
    internet network shutdowns, as well as threats against and arrests of
    victims family members, factors which posed a serious challenge to
    monitoring protests and documenting casualties. The security forces used
    illegal, excessive, and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and military
    assault rifles against protesters. They often targeted protesters heads
    and chests, shot them at close range, and in the back. Security forces
    have targeted faces with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to lose
    their eyesight, and according to some reports women s genitalia. The
    bloodiest crackdown took place on September 30th in Zahedan, Baluchestan
    Province, where a protest began at the end of the Friday sermon. The death
    toll is reported to be above 90 for that day. Security forces shot
    protesters outside and worshipers inside the Mosala prayer hall. Many
    injured protesters, fearing arrest, did not go to hospitals where security
    forces have reportedly arrested injured protesters before and after they
    were treated. By February 1, 2023, the Human Rights Activists News Agency
    reported the number of recorded protests to be 1,262. The death toll,
    including protesters and passersby, stood at 527, of whom 71 were
    children. The number of arrests (including of wounded protesters) was
    estimated at a minimum at 22,000 , of whom 766 had already been tried and
    convicted. More than 100 protesters were a
