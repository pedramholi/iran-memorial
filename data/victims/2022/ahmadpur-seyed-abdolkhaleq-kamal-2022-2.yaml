    He actively participated in the protest demonstrations in the city of
    Mahabad, and he took bread and sandwiches to the demonstrators.
    Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Seyed Abdolkhaleq (Kamal)
    Ahmadpur, son of Taher and Maryam, was obtained from an interview
    conducted by Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with an informed person (May 1,
    2023). Additional information on this file has been collected from the
    Islamic Republic News Agency IRNA (November 19, 2022), Kurdistan News
    Agency - Kurdpa (November 18, 2022; June 1 and 8, 2023; June 24 and July
    9, 2023), Hengaw Human Rights Organization (November 19, 2022), and E
    temad Newspaper (November 21, 2022). Mr. Seyed Abdolkhaleq (Kamal)
    Ahmadpur was Kurdish. He was born on November 12, 1988 in Mahabad, Western
    Azerbaijan Province. He had gone to school through ninth grade. He was a
    master plasterer and he worked on interior decorations of buildings. Mr.
    Ahmadpur was married and he had two children. He also took care of his
    aged parents (Boroumand Center Interview, May 1, 2023). Mr. Ahmadpur was a
    man who Loved his family. He was well known, well respected, gregarious,
    humorous, and sociable . (Boroumand Center Interview, May 1, 2023).
    According to a knowledgeable source, Mr. Ahmadpur was against the Islamic
    Republic of Iran (Boroumand Center Interview, May 1, 2023). On November
    18, 2022, on Manba Street in Mahabad, where demonstrations were taking
    place, Mr. Ahmadpur was an active participant in the nationwide protests
    sparked by the killing of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested by the
    morality police in Tehran for improper veiling . He also provided bread
    and sandwiches for the protestors on the street (Kurdpa, June 1, 2023).
    2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest background Nationwide protests were sparked by
    the death in custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on
    September 16, 2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality police in
    Tehran for improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead to the
    hospital. The news of her death triggered protests, which started with a
    widespread expression of outrage on social media and the gathering of a
    large crowd in front of the hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez
    (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa was buried. Popular exasperation over
    the morality patrols and the veil in general, aggravated by misleading
    statements of the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s death and the
    impunity generally granted to state agents for the violence used against
    detainees led to months of nationwide protests. Initially led by young
    girls and women who burned their veils, and youth in general, protesters
    adopted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom, chanted during Amini s burial.
    The protest rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with protesters
    calling for an end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and duration of the
    protest was unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the morality police
    from the streets and preventative arrests of journalists and political and
    civil society activists did not stop the protests. By the end of December
    2022, protests had taken place in about 164 cities and towns, including
    localities that had never witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities,
    high schools, businesses, and groups including oil workers, merchants of
    the Tehran bazaar (among others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom
    had been arrested as of February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even
    doctors joined these protests in various forms. Despite the violent
    crackdown and mass arrests, intense protests continued for weeks, at least
    through November 2022, with reports of sporadic activity continuing
    through the beginning of 2023. The State s crackdown was swift and
    accompanied by intermittent landline and cellular internet network
    shutdowns, as well as threats against and arrests of victims family
    members, factors which posed a serious challenge to monitoring protests
    and documenting casualties. The security forces used illegal, excessive,
    and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and military assault rifles
    against protesters. They often targeted protesters heads and chests, shot
    them at close range, and in the back. Security forces have targeted faces
    with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to lose their eyesight, and
    according to some reports women s genitalia. Since the start of the
    nationwide protests, and particularly after reports in late September 2022
    that a police commander in Rask had raped a 15-year-old Baloch girl,
    Sistan and Baluchestan Province became the scene of deadly demonstrations.
    Unlike in other provinces, security forces in Balochistan relied
    exclusively on live ammunition. On September 30, 2022 (Zahedan s Bloody
    Friday), worshippers at Makki Mosque demanded a transparent investigation
    into the sexual assault and accountability from officials. A small group
    of them marched toward Police Station No. 16 while chanting protest
    slogans, where they were met with direct gunfire from security
