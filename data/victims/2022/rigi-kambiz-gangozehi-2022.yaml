    Kambiz Rigi, a 25-year-old taxi driver, was shot and killed during the
    Bloody Friday in Khash. Information regarding the arbitrary execution of
    Kambiz Ganguzehi, son of Allahbakhsh, was obtained from the Halvash
    website (November 4, 2022) and the Instagram page of Iran Revolution
    (March 13, 2023). Additional information was gathered from the ISNA News
    Agency (November 5 and 7, 2022); the official website of Molavi Abdolhamid
    (November 5, 2022); Radio Zamaneh (November 6, 2022); the Balochistan
    Human Rights Campaign (October 5, 2024); ISNA (January 14, 2025); the
    Baloch Activists Campaign (January 17, 2025); and Amnesty International
    (November 11, 2022). Little is known about Kambiz Ganguzehi Rigi's life,
    except that he was from Iran s Baluch ethnic community and worked as a
    taxi driver (Instagram, March 13, 2023). He was killed during the Friday
    prayer protest in Khash, which coincided with nationwide demonstrations
    following Mahsa Amini s death. Mr. Ganguzehi Rigi was in Khash on November
    4, 2022. 2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest background Nationwide protests were
    sparked by the death in custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa)
    Amini on September 16, 2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality
    police in Tehran for improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead
    to the hospital. The news of her death triggered protests, which started
    with a widespread expression of outrage on social media and the gathering
    of a large crowd in front of the hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez
    (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa was buried. Popular exasperation over
    the morality patrols and the veil in general, aggravated by misleading
    statements of the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s death and the
    impunity generally granted to state agents for the violence used against
    detainees led to months of nationwide protests. Initially led by young
    girls and women who burned their veils, and youth in general, protesters
    adopted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom, chanted during Amini s burial.
    The protest rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with protesters
    calling for an end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and duration of the
    protest was unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the morality police
    from the streets and preventative arrests of journalists and political and
    civil society activists did not stop the protests. By the end of December
    2022, protests had taken place in about 164 cities and towns, including
    localities that had never witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities,
    high schools, businesses, and groups including oil workers, merchants of
    the Tehran bazaar (among others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom
    had been arrested as of February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even
    doctors joined these protests in various forms. Despite the violent
    crackdown and mass arrests, intense protests continued for weeks, at least
    through November 2022, with reports of sporadic activity continuing
    through the beginning of 2023. The State s crackdown was swift and
    accompanied by intermittent landline and cellular internet network
    shutdowns, as well as threats against and arrests of victims family
    members, factors which posed a serious challenge to monitoring protests
    and documenting casualties. The security forces used illegal, excessive,
    and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and military assault rifles
    against protesters. They often targeted protesters heads and chests, shot
    them at close range, and in the back. Security forces have targeted faces
    with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to lose their eyesight, and
    according to some reports women s genitalia. Since the start of the
    nationwide protests, and particularly after reports in late September 2022
    that a police commander in Rask had raped a 15-year-old Baloch girl,
    Sistan and Baluchestan Province became the scene of deadly demonstrations.
    Unlike in other provinces, security forces in Balochistan relied
    exclusively on live ammunition. On September 30, 2022 (Zahedan s Bloody
    Friday), worshippers at Makki Mosque demanded a transparent investigation
    into the sexual assault and accountability from officials. A small group
    of them marched toward Police Station No. 16 while chanting protest
    slogans, where they were met with direct gunfire from security forces and
    plainclothes agents. Armed forces even fired into the mosque itself. At
    least 97 people were killed in Zahedan that day. In the aftermath, cities
    across Balochistan, including Khash, Saravan, and Rask, witnessed further
    protest gatherings. On November 4, 2022 (Khash s Bloody Friday), security
    forces again responded with extreme violence. After Friday prayers, they
    opened fire with live ammunition on protesters and even bystanders. At
    least 18 people, including two children, were killed and many others were
    wounded. The Zahedan protests continued every Friday for months. Under
    pressure, the Armed Forces Judiciary eventually indicted 11 members of the
    security forces on charges
