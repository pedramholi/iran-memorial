    He was making ends meet for his family of five with great difficulty,
    going door to door in villages around Shiraz to sell blankets and
    mattresses. He was the victim of poverty and a corrupt and ruthless
    judiciary. Information about the execution of Mr. Abdolreza Shafi'i was
    drawn from Twitter posts and information, including court documents sent
    to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran (ABC) by Mehdi
    Hajati, a lawyer who had practiced in Shiraz. (March 15, 2022) Additional
    information was drawn from Boroumand Center's interview with a person
    familiar with Mr. Shafi'i s case. (March 28, 2022) Mr. Shafi'i was a Shia
    Muslim and resident of Bavanat in Fars Province and had a high school
    education. He was married and had three children. He earned a living with
    difficulties by selling blankets and mattresses in villages around Shiraz.
    He liked soccer and was a good soccer player. (ABC interview, March 28,
    2022) Arrest and Detention At 2 AM on December 18, 2022, Akbarabad Police
    arrested Mr. Shafi'i's car after being tipped off regarding transport of
    synthetic drugs from Yazd Province to Fars Province. He was arrested after
    the police discovered two containers containing 20 liters of liquid in his
    car. (Branch 46 of the Supreme Court judgment) Mr. Shafi'i was detained
    and interrogated in Shahzdeh Qasem police station for 40 days without
    access to a lawyer before being transferred to Pirbano Prison, some 20 km
    outside Shiraz. Pirbano is a prison with limited amenities dedicated to
    drug offenders. (ABC interview March 15, 2022) Trial Based on the
    information in the Supreme Court judgment and information obtained by
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, Mr. Shafi'i trial was held in several stage
    due to the lack of sufficient information regarding the content and
    concentration of the liquid contained in the two containers found in his
    car. Branch 2 of Shiraz Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Shafi'i sometime
    before June 28, 2020. Mr. Shafi'i was present in court as well as a court
    assigned lawyer and in the absence of his family members. The other
    individuals involved in his case were not present in court. Branch 46 of
    the Supreme Court reviewed the appeal of Mr. Shafi'i in October 2020
    without the presence of the defendant or his attorney. Charges Based on
    the Supreme Court judgment dated September 29, 2020, Mr. Abdolreza Shafi'i
    was accused of manufacturing and transporting "21.2 kilos of
    methamphetamines [dissolved in water] and having transported it in the
    form of liquid to mislead agents." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The evidence in Mr. Shafi'i's case as enumerated in the Supreme
    Court judgment was "the police report, the manner of recovery of drugs
    from the defendant s vehicle; the defendant s admission that the drugs
    were discovered in his vehicle; his unjustifiable [assertion and]
    statements of defense to the effect that he had transported the same,
    [thinking] it was alcohol; the laboratory s multiple conclusions regarding
    the nature of the discovered narcotics and the manner of obtainment
    thereof; the Defendant s contradictory statements regarding the manner of
    [accepting], loading, and delivery of the drugs; and other available
    evidence..." The judgment mentions the laboratory's written conclusion
    that all the chemical reactions on the recovered liquid, as well as the
    process of converting the liquid to crystal meth were performed by the
    defendant. He transported the same in liquid form in order to deceive the
    police. After the liquid was recovered, it was converted into solid form
    without any further actions by the officers, whereupon the net weight of
    the crystal meth was determined to be 21.2 kilograms (47 pounds). All the
    stages of chemical conversions from liquid to crystal meth had already
    been performed by the defendant and it was not precursor crystal meth .
    Defense In his defense, Mr. Safi'ee stressed that he transported the
    containers, which he had been told, were filled with home-made drinking
    alcohol. The Supreme Court judgment also acknowledges that at
