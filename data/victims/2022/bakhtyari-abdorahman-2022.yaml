    2022 Protests - Sanandaj Following the death of Jina Mahsa Amini on
    September 15, 2022, protests commenced at Jina s funeral in her hometown
    of Saqqez and spread afterward to other cities in Kordestan. Sanandaj was
    the first city where protesters turned out in solidarity with the people
    of Saqqez, and during the months-long duration of the Women, Life, Freedom
    uprising, various streets and neighborhoods in Sanandaj witnessed ongoing
    anti-government protests. Sanandaj was the city with the highest number of
    Kurdish citizens who lost their lives in the uprising 22 of 123 total
    throughout Iran. State forces first killed protesters in this city on
    October 8, 2022. Repression of popular protests in Sanandaj was so intense
    that Amnesty International warned in an October 10, 2022 statement of
    widespread dimensions of repression, with state forces using weapons of
    war and firing at houses.
