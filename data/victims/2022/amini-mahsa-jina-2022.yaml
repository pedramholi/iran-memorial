    The arrest and subsequent death in custody of Mahsa (Jina) Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman from Saqqez, at the hands of Iran's morality police sparked the largest protest movement in the history of the Islamic Republic — the Women, Life, Freedom movement.

    Mahsa (Jina) Amini was born on October 8, 2000, into a Kurdish Sunni family in Saqqez, Kurdistan Province. Among her family and close relatives, she was always called Jina, a Kurdish name meaning "new life." Her official name was recorded as Mahsa due to restrictions on registering Kurdish names. She had one sibling, a younger brother named Ashkan, with whom she shared a very close bond.

    Ms. Amini attended Resalat Elementary School near her home in Saqqez. In high school, she chose the natural sciences track, aspiring to pursue medical or pharmaceutical studies. She completed a pharmacy technician course and was admitted to the University of Urmia in 2022 to study microbiology. According to her mother, she had purchased all the necessary medical instruments and always said: "My only goal is to serve humanity. I want to awaken the human spirit." She was also interested in radio broadcasting and often practiced at home.

    Her family described her as "healthy and calm" since childhood, someone who "always had a smile on her face." Her father called her "a quiet, modest person who minded her own business." A close cousin recalled: "Her parents never raised their voices at her," and said she was beloved by all members of the extended family. Her closest friend was her mother; they spent most of their time together.

    In September 2022, Mahsa traveled with her family to northern Iran, then to Tehran, to visit relatives. On September 13 at approximately 6:30 p.m., she and her brother were exiting the Shahid Haqqani metro station in Tehran when the morality police (Gasht-e Ershad) stopped her because of her attire. When her brother tried to intervene, telling the officers they were from out of town, they twisted his arm to restrain him. Mahsa was placed in a police van and taken to the Moral Security Police detention center on Vozara Street for a so-called "re-education and guidance class."

    Less than two hours after her arrest, Mahsa was transferred to Kasra Hospital displaying symptoms of brain death. Her family was not informed until they arrived at the hospital and found her in a coma, connected to life support. She passed away on September 16, 2022, after spending three days in a coma.

    The Iranian government claimed her death resulted from sudden cardiac arrest linked to pre-existing conditions. Her family disputed this account, pointing to visible bruises on her body. The UN Fact-Finding Mission later determined that physical violence inflicted by security forces during her detention caused her death. No official has ever been held accountable.

    Her funeral in Saqqez on September 17 became the first of thousands of protests that would spread to over 150 cities across Iran under the slogan "Zan, Zendegi, Azadi" — Woman, Life, Freedom.
