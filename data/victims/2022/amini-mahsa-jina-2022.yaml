    was also obtained from BBC Persian (October 27, 2022, and September 16,
    2023); ISNA (September 21, October 10, and October 26, 2022); Euronews

    Amini was born on October 8, 2000, into a Kurdish Sunni family in Saqqez,
    in Iran's Kurdistan Province. Since her family did not want her to start
    school a year later, her date of birth was officially recorded as
    September 15, 2000. Among her family and close relatives, she was always
    called Jina, a Kurdish name meaning "new life." According to her mother,
    her official name was recorded as Mahsa due to restrictions on registering
    Kurdish names and concerns about potential obstacles in school and
    university enrollment. Ms. Amini had only one sibling: a younger brother
    named Ashkan who was four years her junior. The two shared a very close
    bond (BBC Persian, September 18, 2022; September 18, 2023). Ms. Amini
    attended Resalat Elementary School near her home in Saqqez. In high
    school, she chose the natural sciences track, aspiring to pursue medical
    or pharmaceutical studies. In addition to completing a pharmacy technician
    course, she was admitted to the University of Urmia in 2022 to study
    microbiology and planned to move there for her studies. According to her
    mother, Ms. Amini was so interested in medicine that she had purchased all
    the necessary medical instruments. She always said, 'My only goal is to
    serve humanity. I want to awaken the human spirit' (BBC Persian, September
    18, 2022; BBC Persian, September 18, 2023). Jina was interested in radio
    broadcasting and often practiced at home. Although her father had set up a
    clothing store for her in Saqqez, she had little interest in the business
    and preferred to dedicate herself to academic pursuits and her personal
    passions, according to her mother. Her mother further noted that Jina did
    not have many friends and that her closest and dearest friend was her
    mother herself; they spent most of their time together (BBC Persian,
    September 18, 2023). According to her family and relatives, Ms. Amini had
    been "healthy and calm" since childhood and "always had a smile on her
    face." Her father described her as "a quiet, modest person who minded her
    own business" (Deutsche Welle, September 21, 2022). A cousin who was very
    close to her recalled: "Her parents never raised their voices at her," and
    said she was beloved by all members of the extended family (Ham-Mihan,
    September 18, 2022). In September 2022, Mahsa (Jina) Amini traveled with
    her family to northern Iran, then to Tehran. On her way to visit relatives
    at her aunt s house, she was arrested by the morality police (BBC Persian,
    September 18, 2023; Ham-Mihan, September 16 and 18, 2022). Arrest and
    detention On Tuesday, September 13, 2022, Ms. Mahsa (Jina) Amini was
    arrested by the morality police in Tehran. Less than two hours later, she
    was transferred to Kasra Hospital, displaying symptoms of brain death. She
    passed away on September 16, 2022, after spending three days in a coma. On
    September 13 at approximately 6:30 p.m., Ms. Amini and her brother were
    exiting the Shahid Haqqani metro station on the Haqqani Expressway in
    Tehran when the morality police stopped Ms. Amini because of her attire.
    When her brother tried to intervene, telling the officers that they were
    from out of town, they twisted his arm to restrain him. Ms. Amini was
    ultimately placed in a police van and taken to the Moral Security Police
    detention center on Vozara Street in Tehran for a "re-education and
    guidance class," according to officials (IranWire, September 14, 2022;
