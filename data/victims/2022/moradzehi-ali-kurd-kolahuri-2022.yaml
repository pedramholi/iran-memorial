    Ali was known for his kindness and hard work. He was a village
    schoolteacher and a skilled builder. The houses and gardens in Burtai and
    Mirjaveh that stand today are lasting proof of his hard work and talent.
    Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Ali Kord Kolahuri
    (Moradzehi), son of Yahya, was gathered from an ABC interview with an
    informed person (September 24, 2023); reports published on IranWire
    (November 3, 2023); and Halvash website and X network (November 4, 2022,
    and May 22, 2023). Additional information was obtained from reports
    published by ISNA (November 5 and 7, 2022); the Office of Molavi
    Abdolhamid website (November 5, 2022); Radio Zamaneh (November 6, 2022);
    the Baluchistan Human Rights Campaign (October 5, 2024); ISNA (January 13,
    2025); and the Baloch Activists Campaign (January 16, 2025). Ali Kord
    Kolahuri (Moradzehi) was born on May 22, 1997. He was single and lived in
    the village of Burtai in Mirjaveh County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province.
    He worked as an elementary school teacher at Shahid Mahmoud Kamalzehi
    School in Burtai while pursuing a master's degree at Azad University.
    (Halvash Twitter/X post, May 22, 2023). Mr. Kord Kolahuri (Moradzehi)
    worked as a skilled construction master in addition to teaching. Many
    houses and gardens in Burtai and Mirjaveh are the result of his efforts
    and skills. He was known for his dedication, good character, and
    willingness to help the underprivileged and those in need. (ABC interview
    with an informed individual, September 24, 2023). A week before he joined
    the protest in front of the Khash governor s office, his mother urged him
    to get married. He responded, "My next bride will be a heavenly maiden."
    According to an informed source, Ali Kord (Moradzehi) was deeply disturbed
    by the events of Zahedan s Bloody Friday and the Chabahar massacre, as
    well as the injustices inflicted upon the Baluch people. With courage, he
    said, We ve been oppressed all these years how long must we remain silent?
    (ABC interview with an informed individual, September 24, 2023). On
    November 4, 2022, Mr. Kord Kolahuri (Moradzehi) posted his last Instagram
    story from the Al-Khalil Mosque in Khash shortly before noon, writing: "Be
    patient. God knows what situation you are in." He then participated in the
    protest in front of the Khash governor s office. (ABC interview with an
    informed individual, September 24, 2023). 2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest
    background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in custody of
    22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16, 2022. Amini
    had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for improper veiling on
    September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The news of her death
    triggered protests, which started with a widespread expression of outrage
    on social media and the gathering of a large crowd in front of the
    hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa
    was buried. Popular exasperation over the morality patrols and the veil in
    general, aggravated by misleading statements of the authorities regarding
    the cause of Mahsa s death and the impunity generally granted to state
    agents for the violence used against detainees led to months of nationwide
    protests. Initially led by young girls and women who burned their veils,
    and youth in general, protesters adopted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom,
    chanted during Amini s burial. The protest rapidly took on a clear
    anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an end to the Islamic
    Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was unprecedented. State
    efforts to withdraw the morality police from the streets and preventative
    arrests of journalists and political and civil society activists did not
    stop the protests. By the end of December 2022, protests had taken place
    in about 164 cities and towns, including localities that had never
    witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities, high schools, businesses,
    and groups including oil workers, merchants of the Tehran bazaar (among
    others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom had been arrested as of
    February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even doctors joined these
    protests in various forms. Despite the violent crackdown and mass arrests,
    intense protests continued for weeks, at least through November 2022, with
    reports of sporadic activity continuing through the beginning of 2023. The
    State s crackdown was swift and accompanied by intermittent landline and
    cellular internet network shutdowns, as well as threats against and
    arrests of victims family members, factors which posed a serious challenge
    to monitoring protests and documenting casualties. The security forces
    used illegal, excessive, and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and
    military assault rifles against protesters. They often targeted protesters
    heads and chests, shot them at close range, and in the back. Security
    forces have targeted faces with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to
    lose their eyesight, and according
