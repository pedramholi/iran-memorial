    Mr. Mohammad Jamebozorg stood firm in defending his rights until the very
    last moments of his life. Information regarding the arbitrary execution of
    Mr. Mohammad Jamebozorg, son of Ezat, was obtained from an interview
    conducted by the Sharq Network website with Mr. Jamebozorg's son (April
    27, 2023; January 13, 2024). Additional details were gathered from the BBC
    Persian website (May 2 and May 7, 2023), the Voice of America YouTube
    channel (September 25, 2023), the Modara News website (September 2, 2024),
    Dadban (July 20 and October 19, 2025) and Mohammad Jamebozorg s son's
    Instagram page (July 20 and October 16, 2025). Mr. Mohammad Jamebozorg was
    born on March 23, 1963 in Tuyserkan, a city in Hamadan Province. He
    resided in the city of Malard, Tehran Province, with his wife, Mrs. Maryam
    Jafari, and their two sons, Mas'ud and Meysam. He owned and managed a
    carpet shop across the street from his home. (Sharq Network, April 27,
    2023; BBC Persian, September 3, 2024) Mr. Jamebozorg was killed in his
    home in the early hours of September 24, 2022, by IRGC-affiliated security
    forces during the "Woman, Life, Freedom" protests. 2022 (Mahsa Amini)
    Protest background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in
    custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16,
    2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for
    improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The
    news of her death triggered protests, which started with a widespread
    expression of outrage on social media and the gathering of a large crowd
    in front of the hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan
    Province), where Mahsa was buried. Popular exasperation over the morality
    patrols and the veil in general, aggravated by misleading statements of
    the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s death and the impunity
    generally granted to state agents for the violence used against detainees
    led to months of nationwide protests. Initially led by young girls and
    women who burned their veils, and youth in general, protesters adopted the
    slogan Women, Life, Freedom, chanted during Amini s burial. The protest
    rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an
    end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was
    unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the morality police from the
    streets and preventative arrests of journalists and political and civil
    society activists did not stop the protests. By the end of December 2022,
    protests had taken place in about 164 cities and towns, including
    localities that had never witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities,
    high schools, businesses, and groups including oil workers, merchants of
    the Tehran bazaar (among others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom
    had been arrested as of February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even
    doctors joined these protests in various forms. Despite the violent
    crackdown and mass arrests, intense protests continued for weeks, at least
    through November 2022, with reports of sporadic activity continuing
    through the beginning of 2023. The State s crackdown was swift and
    accompanied by intermittent landline and cellular internet network
    shutdowns, as well as threats against and arrests of victims family
    members, factors which posed a serious challenge to monitoring protests
    and documenting casualties. The security forces used illegal, excessive,
    and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and military assault rifles
    against protesters. They often targeted protesters heads and chests, shot
    them at close range, and in the back. Security forces have targeted faces
    with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to lose their eyesight, and
    according to some reports women s genitalia. Since the start of the
    nationwide protests, and particularly after reports in late September 2022
    that a police commander in Rask had raped a 15-year-old Baloch girl,
    Sistan and Baluchestan Province became the scene of deadly demonstrations.
    Unlike in other provinces, security forces in Balochistan relied
    exclusively on live ammunition. On September 30, 2022 (Zahedan s Bloody
    Friday), worshippers at Makki Mosque demanded a transparent investigation
    into the sexual assault and accountability from officials. A small group
    of them marched toward Police Station No. 16 while chanting protest
    slogans, where they were met with direct gunfire from security forces and
    plainclothes agents. Armed forces even fired into the mosque itself. At
    least 97 people were killed in Zahedan that day. In the aftermath, cities
    across Balochistan, including Khash, Saravan, and Rask, witnessed further
    protest gatherings. On November 4, 2022 (Khash s Bloody Friday), security
    forces again responded with extreme violence. After Friday prayers, they
    opened fire with live ammunition on protesters and even bystanders. At
    least 18 people, including two children, were killed and many others were
    wounded. The Zahedan protests continued every Frid
