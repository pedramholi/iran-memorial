    When officers shot Behnam, they prevented anyone from approaching to help
    or take him to the hospital. They threatened to open fire on anyone who
    tried to get close. Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Mr.
    Behnam Layeqpur, son of Hamideh Bigham Moqaddam and Ali Layeqpur, was
    obtained from an interview with an informed person conducted by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC) on April 7, 2023, as well as from
    observing the image of his death certificate. Additional information was
    taken from reports published by IranWire on October 6, 2022; Radio Zamaneh
    on October 12, 2022; Behnam Layeqpur s Instagram page, quoted by the
    Manoto TV Twitter account on May 12, 2023; two videos published by Voice
    of America on September 28 and November 5, 2022; and the Aban-e Khunin
    YouTube channel on November 3, 2022. Mr. Layeqpur was born on January 28,
    1986, in Rasht. He was the youngest child in his family and had one sister
    and one brother. As a teenager, he lost his father to illness. He owned a
    tattoo and piercing studio. According to those close to him, he was a
    kind, hardworking, nature-loving man who cared for four cats (ABC
    interview with an informed individual, April 7, 2023). With the onset of
    the nationwide protests following the death of Mahsa (Jina) Amini, Behnam
    announced on his professional Instagram page: "Out of respect for the
    people of Iran, we will not be engaging in any activities until further
    notice." He also took part in protest gatherings in Rasht. According to
    his sister, "Our mother was constantly worried and kept telling him not to
    participate in the demonstrations. But Behnam would turn off his phone and
    then tell our mother that he had been somewhere without reception"
    (IranWire, October 6, 2022; Radio Zamaneh, October 12, 2022). In his final
    stories on his personal Instagram page, he wrote, "What do you think our
    daughters are? Why do you treat them this way? Why have you created a
    situation where so many girls are afraid to be female in just these past
    two days? Why have you made so many people think of leaving country?" He
    also posted, "This life we are living is not what life truly means. Life
    is beyond this. Yesterday, I saw a 12-year-old child and a 70-year-old in
    the crowd. That speaks volumes. #Honor." (Behnam Layeqpur's Instagram
    page, quoted by Manoto TV's Twitter account on May 12, 2023). 2022 (Mahsa
    Amini) Protest background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in
    custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16,
    2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for
    improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The
    news of her death triggered protests, which started with a widespread
    expression of outrage on social media and the gathering of a large crowd
    in front of the hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan
    Province), where Mahsa was buried. Popular exasperation over the morality
    patrols and the veil in general, aggravated by misleading statements of
    the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s death and the impunity
    generally granted to state agents for the violence used against detainees
    led to months of nationwide protests. Initially led by young girls and
    women who burned their veils, and youth in general, protesters adopted the
    slogan Women, Life, Freedom, chanted during Amini s burial. The protest
    rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an
    end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was
    unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the morality police from the
    streets and preventative arrests of journalists and political and civil
    society activists did not stop the protests. By the end of December 2022,
    protests had taken place in about 164 cities and towns, including
    localities that had never witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities,
    high schools, businesses, and groups including oil workers, merchants of
    the Tehran bazaar (among others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom
    had been arrested as of February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even
    doctors joined these protests in various forms. Despite the violent
    crackdown and mass arrests, intense protests continued for weeks, at least
    through November 2022, with reports of sporadic activity continuing
    through the beginning of 2023. The State s crackdown was swift and
    accompanied by intermittent landline and cellular internet network
    shutdowns, as well as threats against and arrests of victims family
    members, factors which posed a serious challenge to monitoring protests
    and documenting casualties. The security forces used illegal, excessive,
    and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and military assault rifles
    against protesters. They often targeted protesters heads and chests, shot
    them at close range, and in the back. Security forces have targeted faces
    with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to lose their eyesight, and
    according to some reports women s genitalia.
