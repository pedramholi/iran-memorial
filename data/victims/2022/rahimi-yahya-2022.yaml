    Joint Description of the Kurdistan Human Rights Network (KHRN) and the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Centre (ABC): This file is part of the joint
    documentary efforts of the Kurdistan Human Rights Network (KHRN) and the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran (ABC). KHRN intends
    to document cases of extrajudicial executions related to Kurdish civilians
    and activists over time. For this purpose, it has utilized the research
    experiences and methodologies of ABC, which has been active for years in
    documenting extrajudicial executions and other human rights violations in
    Iran. The reports on this case and subsequent reports will be published in
    the Documentation section of the KHRN's website and ABC s Omid Memorial.
    Some of the interviews used in this documentation, as well as
    supplementary interviews, have been conducted by ABC, some by the KHRN,
    and some collaboratively. Information related to the case of Mr. Yahya
    Rahimi (Sarab Shahraki), son of Ahmad Rahimi and Ghadamkheyr Mirzaei, has
    been obtained through interviews with one of Rahimi s family members (May
    9, 2023) and an eyewitness (March 20, 2023). To complete the information
    for this case, sources including Fars News Agency (October 8, 2022), IRNA
    News Agency (December 1, 2022), ISNA News Agency (December 1, 2022), Radio
    Zamaneh's website (October 25, 2022), BBC Persian (December 10, 2022 and
    September 4, 2023), Radio Farda (November 1, 2022), and the website of
    Human Rights Watch (September 19, 2022) have been used. Mr. Yahya Rahimi,
    a Sunni Kurdish civilian, was born on November 30, 1991 in the city of
    Sanandaj, Kurdistan Province. He was 31 years old, having completed
    education up to the third year of middle school, and he had been working
    as a tile worker since 2016 (Interview with one of Rahimi s family
    members, May 9, 2023). His parents were farmers (BBC Persian, December 10,
    2022). Mr. Rahimi was married, and one year had passed since his marriage.
    A year before being killed, despite facing financial difficulties and even
    the need to work in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, he managed to save money
    and start a life together with his beloved partner (Interview with one of
    Rahimi s family members, May 9, 2023). Mr. Rahimi and his wife were living
    in a rental residence in the Nanaleh district on the outskirts of
    Sanandaj. They had aspirations to build their own home on a piece of land
    they had purchased (Interview with one of Rahimi s family members, May 9,
    2023). The Nanaleh district (Avraz neighborhood), where Mr. Rahimi resided
    until the last days of his life, is one of the densely populated
    peripheral areas of the city of Sanandaj, inhabited mainly by
    working-class families. This neighborhood was one of the main centers of
    protests during the 2022 uprising and was actively involved in street
    demonstrations for over two months without interruption (Joint research by
    ABC and KHRN). According to one of Mr. Rahimi's close acquaintances, he
    was a person who loved reading, especially Iranian history. He was a
    "protest-minded individual" who "wanted Iran to be a free, prosperous, and
    dignified country for its people." According to the interviewee, he was
    never a member of any organization or group, but he did have grievances
    about the current situation and had participated in protests against
    gasoline price hikes in November 2019. According to one of his relatives,
    after work and upon returning home, he spent a lot of time following news
    and events in Iran (Interview with one of Rahimi s family members, May 9,
    2023). One of Mr. Rahimi's close acquaintances described him as a
    "selfless, kind-hearted, and cheerful person" ( Interview with one of
    Rahimi s family members, May 9, 2023 ). 2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest
    background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in custody of Ms.
    Jina Mahsa Amini, a 22-year old Kurdish woman, on September 16, 2022.
    Amini had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for improper
    veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The protests,
    which started in front of the hospital and continued in Saqqez County
    (Kurdistan Province) where Mahsa was buried, were triggered by popular
    exasperation over the morality patrols, misleading statements of the
    authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s killing and the resulting
    impunity for the violence used against detainees, as well as the mandatory
    veil in general. This protest, initially led by young girls and women who
    burned their veils and youth in general who chanted the slogan Women,
    Life, Freedom, rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with protesters
    calling for an end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and duration of the
    protest was unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the morality police
    from the streets and preventative arrests of journalists and political and
    civil society activists did not stop the protests. By the end of December
    2022, protests had taken place in about 164 cities and towns, including
    localities that had never witnessed
