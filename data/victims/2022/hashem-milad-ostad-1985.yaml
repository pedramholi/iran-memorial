    Milad was shot as he rode a motorbike after taking part in protests in the
    capital. His parents alleged security forces pressured them to go along with
    state media reports that he was a Basij member killed by "rioters" and that
    security forces threatened to kill their two other sons and bury Milad's body
    secretly in a remote place if they did not co-operate.
