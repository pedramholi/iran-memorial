  Rahnavard was accused of fatally stabbing two Basij militia members and wounding
  four others during protests in Mashhad on November 17, 2022. He was arrested on
  November 19. His trial consisted of a single session before the Mashhad
  Revolutionary Court on November 29. He was publicly hanged from a crane on
  December 12, with hands and feet bound and a black bag over his head — just 23
  days after arrest. State media broadcast forced "confessions" in which his heavily
  bandaged left arm in a cast suggested torture. He was denied a lawyer of his choice.
  He was the second protester executed during the Woman, Life, Freedom movement and
  the first to be publicly hanged.
