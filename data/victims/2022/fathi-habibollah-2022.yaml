    Those close to Habibollah Fathi described him as a warmhearted,
    family-oriented man with strong social ties. He was a well-known and
    respected figure within the Divandareh community. Information regarding
    the life and arbitrary execution of Mr. Habibollah Fathi, son of Sa id and
    Golkhas, was obtained through an Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC)
    interview with one of his relatives on June 25, 2023. Additional
    information was gathered from the websites of HRANA (September 16, 2023),
    the Kurdistan Human Rights Network (October 2, 2023), Kurdpa (November 19,
    2023), as well as the website and X page of Iran International TV
    (December 23, 2022, and March 15, 2023), and documents from the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC) archives. Mr. Fathi was born on June
    24, 1960, in Haji Musa, a village near Divandareh in Kurdistan Province.
    His education was limited to basic literacy. He was married and the father
    of eight children. He worked independently, trading in the local market.
    (ABC interview with a relative, June 25, 2023). Mr. Fathi was politically
    active. According to a relative, he had been in contact with Kurdish
    political groups since he was young. At the start of the 1979 Revolution,
    he joined the Komala Organization and served as a Peshmerga for two years.
    After his brother, who was also a member of Komala, was arrested, Mr.
    Fathi left the organization. Some time later, government officials
    summoned him and his father to the prison to follow up on his brother s
    case. However, when they arrived, they were given his brother s
    bullet-riddled body. After his brother was executed, Mr. Fathi stepped
    back from political and organizational activities. Instead, he chose a
    path of civil engagement, which, according to a relative, was also marked
    by ongoing pressure and hardship (ABC interview with a relative, June 25,
    2023). During the nationwide protests triggered by the killing of Mahsa
    (Jina) Amini in 2022, Mr. Fathi actively participated in Divandareh. He
    stayed in contact with young demonstrators, protecting and advising them
    on personal safety. According to one of his relatives, it is believed that
    during the Divandareh protests, forces identified as part of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) marked him as a "leader of the
    demonstrations" (ABC interview with a relative, June 25, 2023). A relative
    described Mr. Fathi as a "family-oriented, kind, and supportive man with
    warm social relations," and therefore "a well-known figure in the city of
    Divandareh." According to this source, some local residents even turned to
    him for help in resolving social and community disputes (ABC interview
    with a relative, June 25, 2023). 2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest background
    Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in custody of 22-year old
    Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16, 2022. Amini had been
    arrested by the morality police in Tehran for improper veiling on
    September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The news of her death
    triggered protests, which started with a widespread expression of outrage
    on social media and the gathering of a large crowd in front of the
    hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa
    was buried. Popular exasperation over the morality patrols and the veil in
    general, aggravated by misleading statements of the authorities regarding
    the cause of Mahsa s death and the impunity generally granted to state
    agents for the violence used against detainees led to months of nationwide
    protests. Initially led by young girls and women who burned their veils,
    and youth in general, protesters adopted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom,
    chanted during Amini s burial. The protest rapidly took on a clear
    anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an end to the Islamic
    Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was unprecedented. State
    efforts to withdraw the morality police from the streets and preventative
    arrests of journalists and political and civil society activists did not
    stop the protests. By the end of December 2022, protests had taken place
    in about 164 cities and towns, including localities that had never
    witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities, high schools, businesses,
    and groups including oil workers, merchants of the Tehran bazaar (among
    others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom had been arrested as of
    February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even doctors joined these
    protests in various forms. Despite the violent crackdown and mass arrests,
    intense protests continued for weeks, at least through November 2022, with
    reports of sporadic activity continuing through the beginning of 2023. The
    State s crackdown was swift and accompanied by intermittent landline and
    cellular internet network shutdowns, as well as threats against and
    arrests of victims family members, factors which posed a serious challenge
    to monitoring protests and documenting casualties. The security forces
    used illegal, excessive, and lethal force with handguns,
