    Joint explanation of the Kurdistan Human Rights Network (Network) and the
    "Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran (ABC): This case is
    a part of the collaborative documentation of the Kurdistan Human Rights
    Network and the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center. The Kurdistan Human Rights
    Network intends to gradually document cases of extrajudicial executions of
    Kurdish citizens and activists. For this purpose, the network has used the
    experiences and research methodology of the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center,
    which has been active in the field of documenting human rights violations
    in Iran for many years. The report of this case and subsequent reports
    will be published in the "documentation" section of the Kurdistan Human
    Rights Network website and the "Omid Memorial" of the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center. Some of the original and follow-up interviews used in
    this documentation were conducted by the Center, some by the Network, and
    some in collaboration. Information about the extrajudicial execution of
    Mr. Ayoub (Ribaz) Salehivand, son of Abdullah Salehivand and Khadija
    Aramidehnia, was obtained via interviews on two different occasions with
    one of the family's relatives (March 4, 2022, and September 6, 2023) and
    another, with one of his friends (August 21, 2023). To complete this case
    s information, the material was obtained from Mr. Salehivand's personal
    Instagram page, Kurdistan Human Rights Network reports (November 23,
    2022), BBC Persian on X social media network, formerly known as Twitter
    (November 23, 2022) and Mr. Salehivand's death certificate. Mr. Salehivand
    was born on September 30, 2002, to a Kurdish and Sunni family. He spent
    his childhood and elementary education in Yusefkand village, Mahabad
    Township, in West Azerbaijan Province. According to one of Mr.
    Salehivand's close relatives, given that his interests did not correspond
    with the "scholastic system," he dropped out in the last year of high
    school and turned to industrial jobs. He was a construction rebar master
    and worked with his uncle. Mr. Salehivand was also interested in
    tattooing. He was self-taught and learned the art of tattooing from his
    friends (Interview with a relative, February 20, 2023). In the summer of
    2022, as the protests against the murder of Jina (Mahsa) Amini took off,
    despite his family's opposition and the violence of the security forces,
    Mr. Salehivand participated in many demonstrations. According to one of
    his relatives, in response to his family's opposition to his participation
    in the protests, he said: "It doesn't matter what happens to me; if we
    don't go, who will go to the protests? It is my responsibility and duty to
    participate." According to the interviewee, he and other protesters lit a
    fire on the main Mahabad-Orumieh road near his village during one of the
    protests (Interview with a relative, March 4, 2023). According to the same
    source, Mr. Salehivand had a "very fearless and courageous" personality,
    was interested in Kurdistan's political issues, and was familiar with
    "Kurdish history and the region." He was also an "introvert," and his
    speech was measured (Interview with a relative, March 4, 2023). 2022
    (Mahsa Amini) Protest background Nationwide protests were sparked by the
    death in custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on
    September 16, 2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality police in
    Tehran for improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead to the
    hospital. The protests, which started in front of the hospital and
    continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa was
    buried, were triggered by popular exasperation over the morality patrols,
    misleading statements of the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s
    death and the resulting impunity for the violence used against detainees,
    as well as the mandatory veil in general. This protest, initially led by
    young girls and women who burned their veils and youth in general who
    chanted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom, rapidly took on a clear
    anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an end to the Islamic
    Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was unprecedented. State
    efforts to withdraw the morality police from the streets and preventative
    arrests of journalists and political and civil society activists did not
    stop the protests. By the end of December 2022, protests had taken place
    in about 164 cities and towns, including localities that had never
    witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities, high schools, businesses,
    and groups including oil workers, merchants of the Tehran bazaar (among
    others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom had been arrested as of
    February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even doctors joined these
    protests in various forms. Despite the violent crackdown and mass arrests,
    intense protests continued for weeks, at least through November 2022, with
    reports of sporadic activity continuing through the beginning of 2023. The
    State s crackdown was swift and accompani
