dreams: >
  Mahsa dreamed of continuing her education and building a life of her own
  choosing. She was described as a quiet, gentle young woman who loved life.
beliefs: >
  Like many young Iranian women, Mahsa wanted the freedom to live without
  the constant surveillance and control of the morality police. Her death
  became the catalyst for the "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement — not because
  she was an activist, but because she was an ordinary young woman whose
  only "crime" was existing.

  Described by family and friends as kind, gentle, and full of life.
  She was visiting Tehran with her family when she was arrested.

# --- DEATH ---
date_of_death: 2022-09-16
age_at_death: 22
place_of_death: "Kasra Hospital, Tehran"
cause_of_death: "Head injuries sustained in morality police custody"
circumstances: >
  On September 13, 2022, Mahsa was arrested by Iran's Guidance Patrol
  (morality police) at the Shahid Haghani Expressway in Tehran for
  allegedly wearing her hijab "improperly." She was taken to the Vozara
  Detention Center. Within hours, she collapsed and was transferred to
  Kasra Hospital in a coma. A CT scan confirmed traumatic head injuries.
  She never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead on September 16.
  Authorities claimed she died of a heart attack, but her family and
  medical evidence contradicted this. A UN investigation concluded Iran
  was responsible for "physical violence" that killed her.
