    He was born and lived in Lahijan, a city in the province of Gilan. He was
    a stonemason by profession, known for his exceptional skill in carving
    detailed images, especially of the Faravahar symbol and Achaemenid
    soldiers. Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Javad Reza'i
    Lafmejani, son of Fatemeh and Parviz, was gathered from an interview
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC) with one of his close
    relatives (April 6, 2023), the Deutsche Welle website (November 28, 2022),
    the burial permit issued by the Gilan Province Forensic Medicine Office
    (November 17, 2022), and the death certificate (November 19, 2022), and
    interviews given by his brother, Mas'ud Reza'i, to Iran International TV
    (November 26 and December 8). Mr. Reza'i was married and had two children.
    He was born and raised in Lahijan, Gilan Province, where he has lived all
    his life. After completing his military service, he began working for a
    company while continuing his education, eventually earning an associate's
    degree in literature. When the company went bankrupt, he switched to
    masonry and tile work. His skills were impressive, especially in carving
    intricate designs such as the Faravahar symbol and Achaemenid soldiers.
    However, he had to give up this profession due to the strain the heavy
    work put on his back. He then worked for a time at a kiosk near Entezam
    Street in Lahijan (ABC's interview with a close relative). Mr. Reza'i lost
    his mother when he was in the third grade: "She was executed after the
    regime fabricated a ridiculous case against her. At just 10 years old,
    Javad had to face this issue and live with the pain. Perhaps the loss of
    his mother prevented him from pursuing many of his dreams." He experienced
    a difficult time at home after his mother's death: "For about four years
    after her death, he cooked at home, preparing meals for his father and
    older brothers, which helped him become very skilled in cooking. His
    school principal would even let him leave an hour early because he knew
    Javad had to prepare the meal. (ABC interview with a close relative). Mr.
    Reza'i had a deep passion for music and literature. His wife, Mrs.
    Khoshkalam, is an educator working in the Education Department of Lahijan.
    According to those close to him, Mr. Reza'i was a gentle, active, and
    cheerful person. He had a special love for animals, especially dogs and
    birds. He owned several dogs and spent hours playing and interacting with
    them (Deutsche Welle). Mr. Reza'i was also interested in current affairs
    and expressed critical opinions on his social media pages on various
    issues, including the executions and imprisonment of intellectuals and
    students, the indoctrination of children in schools, the incompetence of
    officials, and the government's foreign policy. For example, he referred
    to the Islamic Republic's state television and said, "Your lies have
    brought laughter to the people". He also objected to newspapers that had
    blurred the hair of Romina Ashrafi, a 14-year-old girl whom her father
    murdered: "An attitude that censors a little girl's hair is no different
    from the scythe that killed her." As the protests began in 2022, Mr.
    Reza'i became much more active, both on social media and in the streets.
    On several occasions, he and his friends wrote the slogan "Women, Life,
    Freedom" on the walls of their neighborhood at night. He often said, "For
    this revolution, we must pay a price, and that price is our blood." He
    also urged local shopkeepers to close their businesses in solidarity with
    the protests (ABC interview with a close relative). 2022 (Mahsa Amini)
    Protest background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in
    custody of 22-year-old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16,
    2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for
    improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The
    protests, which started in front of the hospital and continued in the city
    of Saqqez (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa was buried, were triggered by
    popular exasperation over the morality patrols, misleading statements of
    the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s death and the resulting
    impunity for the violence used against detainees, as well as the mandatory
    veil in general. This protest, initially led by young girls and women who
    burned their veils and youth in general who chanted the slogan Women,
    Life, Freedom, rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with protesters
    calling for an end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and duration of the
    protest was unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the morality police
    from the streets and preventative arrests of journalists and political and
    civil society activists did not stop the protests. By the end of December
    2022, protests had taken place in about 164 cities and towns, including
    localities that had never witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities,
    high schools, businesses, and groups including oil workers, merchants of
    the Tehran bazaar
