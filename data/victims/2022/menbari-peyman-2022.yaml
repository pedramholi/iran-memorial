    Whenever his mother and sisters begged him not to participate in the
    protests, Mr. Menbari responded, "If I don't go and neither does anyone
    else, then who will?" Information regarding the life and arbitrary
    execution of Peyman Menbari, son of Ayub Menbari and Sahebeh Veisi, was
    obtained through an interview with a relative (February 8, 2023) and an
    informed source (May 27, 2023). News of Mr. Menbari s killing was also
    reported by Human Rights Watch (December 21, 2022). Additional information
    was gathered from the websites of Human Rights Watch (December 21, 2022),
    BBC Persian (October 10, 2023), Radio Farda (November 25, 2023), IranWire
    (October 9, 2022), Radio Zamaneh (March 9, 2024), Kurdpa (November 28,
    2022; February 7, June 10, and July 1, 2023), as well as the social media
    page of Iran International TV on X (October 9, 2023). Peyman Menbari was
    born on June 31, 1997, in Niyar, a village in the Zhavehrud district of
    Sanandaj. He was born into a large, Sunni Kurdish family. His father
    supported their family of ten by working as a laborer. Peyman graduated
    from high school with high marks in the field of experimental sciences.
    According to relatives, he was interested in pursuing a degree in pharmacy
    but left school in 2019 after his father died from illness to help provide
    for his family. (ABC interview with a relative, February 8, 2023; Radio
    Farda, November 25, 2023). Mr. Menbari specialized in building stainless
    steel railings for homes. After an apprenticeship of about three years, he
    became highly skilled and eventually established himself as a master
    craftsman. According to a relative, Peyman was deeply concerned about poor
    people and often said, "Even though I live a relatively calm life and can
    make ends meet, I can t live in comfort when I see my neighbors struggling
    financially." He often felt distressed about this, and once his financial
    situation improved, he began helping impoverished families. (Radio
    Zamaneh, March 9, 2024). Peyman Menbari was socially conscious and deeply
    concerned about the state of society. According to a relative, he was
    upset by the suffering of the Iranian people and "always said that we have
    responsibilities on our shoulders. Now that the people are suffering, we
    cannot stay silent. I could live in comfort and choose to ignore it, but
    turning a blind eye would be shameful and dishonorable. Another close
    relative said that his dream was the freedom of Iran and that he wished to
    die a martyr s death for his homeland and the freedom of his people.
    Peyman once told a friend, "Blessed is the one who becomes a martyr for
    his homeland." (ABC interview with a relative, February 8, 2023; BBC
    Persian, October 10, 2023). According to relatives, Mr. Menbari actively
    participated in the 2022 protests in Sanandaj, which were organized on a
    neighborhood basis. They said his "passion for freedom" filled him with
    "remarkable enthusiasm" during that time. "From the day Mahsa Jina Amini
    died, he could not rest. He refused to attend any celebrations and spent
    every day of the protests in the streets. Whenever his mother and sisters
    pleaded with him not to go, he replied, If I don't go, and if no one else
    does either, then who will? (Radio Farda, November 25, 2023). In his last
    message to a friend, Peyman wrote, "Let us be martyred for freedom, but
    never live in captivity." (IranWire, October 9, 2022). According to a
    source close to the family, "Peyman's mother had told him not to go to the
    protests because something might happen to him." (BBC Persian, October 10,
    2023). In his final Instagram story, Peyman wrote, "This will be the best
    Saturday in history. We will protest, we will strike, and just as they say
    we will destroy; we will riot. If anyone stands in our way, we will fight;
    we will be wounded; we will be martyred. We will turn the streets of the
    city into their hell, and we will continue until my people, my family, and
    my city are completely free. (Screenshot of Peyman Menbari s Instagram
    story, cited by BBC Persian on October 10, 2023.) Peyman Menbari loved
    soccer and wrestled when he was younger. He also regularly went to the
    gym. He had a beautiful voice and often sang stirring Kurdish anthems at
    gatherings. (BBC Persian, October 10, 2023). He was young and had recently
    become engaged to a woman he had loved for six years. According to
    relatives, he had the same simple hopes and dreams as his peers. "Peyman
    had elaborate plans for autumn 2022: He was going to take his ailing
    mother to Tehran for arthritis treatment, take the family on a trip to
    northern Iran, see off his recently engaged sister, and create
    unforgettable memories with the woman he had finally proposed to after six
    years of dating." Relatives described him as a hardworking and studious
    person. Despite his young age, he was known for helping families in need
    (Radio Farda, November 25, 2023; ABC interview with a relative, February
    8, 2023). One niece described him as "a person with a very big heart,
    calm, and
