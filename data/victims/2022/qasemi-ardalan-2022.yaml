    Ardalan Qasemi was not ignorant of the social and political conditions
    around him. During the "Woman, Life, Freedom" protests, he expressed his
    opposition by writing protest slogans on city walls. Information regarding
    the arbitrary execution of Ardalan Qasemi, son of Mostafa Qasemi and
    Valieh Rashidpur, was obtained through three interviews conducted by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with one of his relatives on March 10, 2023;
    November 30, 2024; and January 18, 2025. Reports on Mr. Qasemi s arbitrary
    execution were also published by the Kurdistan Human Rights Network
    (November 13, 2022) and Hengaw (November 12, 2022). Additional information
    was gathered from the Fars News Agency website (November 13, 2022).
    Ardalan Qasemi was born on January 21, 1972, in Gilan-e Gharb, Kermanshah
    Province, to a Kurdish Shia family. He was the third child in a family of
    six. His childhood and adolescence occurred during the Iran-Iraq War,
    which led his family to move to various nearby towns and villages,
    including Eslamabad-e Gharb (formerly Shahabad), Taqi Village, and the Taq
    Taq Miani area. Mr. Qasemi completed his education up to the third year of
    middle school. After his family returned to Gilan-e Gharb, he often
    traveled to Kermanshah for work. From 1991, he resided in Kermanshah. He
    worked for a transportation cooperative, though he did less in his later
    years because of kidney failure. (ABC interview with a relative, March 10,
    2023; November 30, 2024) Relatives described him as "a very pleasant,
    kind, and articulate individual who was friendly with everyone, regardless
    of age. He valued close connections and maintained a broad circle of
    friends." During the 2022 protests, aware of the social situation around
    him, Mr. Qasemi expressed his concerns by writing protest slogans on city
    walls. ( ABC interview with a relative, March 10, 2023). 2022 (Mahsa
    Amini) Protest background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in
    custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16,
    2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for
    improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The
    news of her death triggered protests, which started with a widespread
    expression of outrage on social media and the gathering of a large crowd
    in front of the hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan
    Province), where Mahsa was buried. Popular exasperation over the morality
    patrols and the veil in general, aggravated by misleading statements of
    the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s death and the impunity
    generally granted to state agents for the violence used against detainees
    led to months of nationwide protests. Initially led by young girls and
    women who burned their veils, and youth in general, protesters adopted the
    slogan Women, Life, Freedom, chanted during Amini s burial. The protest
    rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an
    end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was
    unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the morality police from the
    streets and preventative arrests of journalists and political and civil
    society activists did not stop the protests. By the end of December 2022,
    protests had taken place in about 164 cities and towns, including
    localities that had never witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities,
    high schools, businesses, and groups including oil workers, merchants of
    the Tehran bazaar (among others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom
    had been arrested as of February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even
    doctors joined these protests in various forms. Despite the violent
    crackdown and mass arrests, intense protests continued for weeks, at least
    through November 2022, with reports of sporadic activity continuing
    through the beginning of 2023. The State s crackdown was swift and
    accompanied by intermittent landline and cellular internet network
    shutdowns, as well as threats against and arrests of victims family
    members, factors which posed a serious challenge to monitoring protests
    and documenting casualties. The security forces used illegal, excessive,
    and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and military assault rifles
    against protesters. They often targeted protesters heads and chests, shot
    them at close range, and in the back. Security forces have targeted faces
    with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to lose their eyesight, and
    according to some reports women s genitalia. Since the start of the
    nationwide protests, and particularly after reports in late September 2022
    that a police commander in Rask had raped a 15-year-old Baloch girl,
    Sistan and Baluchestan Province became the scene of deadly demonstrations.
    Unlike in other provinces, security forces in Balochistan relied
    exclusively on live ammunition. On September 30, 2022 (Zahedan s Bloody
    Friday), worshippers at Makki Mosque demanded a transparent investigation
    into the sexual assault and accountability from of
