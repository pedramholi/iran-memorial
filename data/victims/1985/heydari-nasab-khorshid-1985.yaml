    The execution of Ms. Khorshid Heydari-Nasab, daughter of Cherag’ali, along
    with 12 others, was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on October 22, 1985.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The newspaper report does not mention the
    charges brought against Ms. Heydari-Nasab. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms.
    Heydari-Nasab’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Kerman declared Ms. Heydari-Nasab a “corruptor on earth” and sentenced him
    to death. The Islamic Revolution’s Supreme Court confirmed the sentenced.
    She and 12 other individuals, including her brother Ebrahim, were hanged
    in the prison of the Police Department of Kerman on October 22, 1985.
