    The execution of Mr. Hassan Sadeqi, along with 21 others, was reported in
    the Kayhan Daily on April 28, 1985. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Sadeqi was charged with “being involved in dealing narcotics as well
    as selling 2 kg of heroin.” Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Sadeqi’s defense.

    Sadeqi to death. Having been confirmed by the Islamic Revolution’s Supreme
    Court, the sentence was carried out.
