    The execution of Mr. Hamid (Abbas) Qobadi (Mojahedin Khalq Iran) , along
    with 14 others, was announced in a communiqu by the Intelligence Office of
    Mazandaran. The communiqu was published in the Kayhan daily on March 11,
    1985. The communiqu is as follows: In the Name of God Due to the favors of
    God and the wise advice of our respectful Imam about ending the Forest
    commotion, as well as the continuous efforts and sacrifices of the Islamic
    Revolution s Revolutionary Guards, the hellish spidery organization of the
    hypocrites was destroyed in the verdant forests of Mazandaran. And all the
    partisans of estekbar (arrogance) were seized by the wrath of the avenging
    and omnipotent God. Away from their fugitive leaders, the traitors abroad,
    and their treacherous clamor, all the members were captured by the valiant
    men of Islam. Mr. Qorbani is also among the 282 individuals listed in a
    United Nations Report on The Situation of Human Right in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran (Note by the Secretary General), published on 13 November
    1985. The report lists these individuals as "Persons who were allegedly
    summarily and arbitrarily executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    1984-1985." In addition, he is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded
    in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The communiqu
    does not specify the charges against Mr. Qobadi. All 14 defendants are
    collectively charged with: membership in the hypocrites organization (term
    used for the Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization by the Islamic Republic
    authorities), martyring an unarmed shepherd who refused to collaborate
    with them with a knife and poniard - not shooting him in order not to
    waste a bullet-, martyring 6 members of Basij (Mobilization Forces) of
    Qaemshahr cruelly while they were asleep, as well as committing tens of
    crimes resulting in 21 martyrs and 23 wounded. Evidence of guilt There is
    no evidence presented in the communiqu that specifically incriminates Mr.
    Qobadi. According to the communiqu all the defendants were implicated
    through both their confessions during the trial in front of the families
    of those killed, and weapons found during search and seizure by the
    revolutionary guards. The report explains: upon searching the shelters of
    the defendants, the revolutionary guards found: tens of war weapons,
    military grenades, cyanide, se rahi (kind of explosive), walkie-talkies,
    and two military compasses, in addition to, many cartridges. There is no
    mention of the specifics of these confessions. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Qobadi s defense. Judgment Mr.Qobadi was sentenced to
    death. There is no information about the tribunal which issued the death
    sentence. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the
    sentence was carried out at dawn. _________________________ *The exclusion
