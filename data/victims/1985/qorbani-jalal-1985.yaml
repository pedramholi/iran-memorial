    The execution of Mr. Jalal Qorbani, son of Ali Asghar and known as Jalal
    Ahangar, along with 24 others, was reported in the Kayhan daily on January
    28, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial, other than Mr. Qorbani was tried at one of the
    tribunals of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office to combat Drugs
    in Tehran. Charges According to this report, Mr. Qorbani and another
    defendant were collectively charged with “being greatly and continuously
    active in supplying and distributing heroin, dealing 4.5 kg of heroin at
    three different times...” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the
    report, Mr. Qorbani or his codefendant had four convictions for supplying
    and distributing narcotics and was in possession of 47 g of heroin when
    was arrested. Defense No information is available on Mr. Qorbani’s
    defense. Judgment One of the tribunals of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecution Office to combat Drugs in Tehran sentenced Mr. Qorbani to
    death and the Supreme Court approved the verdict. Mr. Jalal Qorbani and 24
    other individuals were hanged at Qasr prison in Tehran on January 28,
    1985.
