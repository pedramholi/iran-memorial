    The executions of Mr. Shir Mohammad Najafzadeh, son of Najaf Qoli, and
    another defendant were reported in the Kayhan daily on April 20, 1985.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial, except that Mr. Najafzadeh was tried at Branch 137 of
    the Penal Court of Tehran. Charges According to this report, Mr.
    Najafzadeh was charged with “participation in a first-degree murder,
    storing an unauthorized weapon, threatening with a weapon and adultery
    with the victim’s wife.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Najafzadeh’s defense. Judgment Branch 137 of the Penal Court of Tehran
    sentenced Mr. Najafzadeh to death. The Supreme Court approved the verdict
    and Mr. Shir Mohammad Najafzadeh was executed in Qasr prison on June 26,
    1985. According to the newspaper report, “The victim’s wife was sentenced
    to 50 lashes and a prison term of eight and half years.”
