    The execution of Ms. Nahid Tavakkoli, daughter of Mohammad, along with 24
    others, was reported in the Kayhan daily on January 28, 1985. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial,
    other than Ms. Tavakkoli was tried at one of the tribunals of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs in Tehran. Charges
    According to this report, Ms. Tavakkoli and five other defendants were
    collectively charged with “being greatly and continuously active in
    supplying and distributing heroin, establishing a heroin-trafficking gang,
    buying 14 kg of heroin from Zahedan and selling it in Tehran.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to this report, one of the six
    defendants was in “possession of 3.330 kg of heroin at the time of arrest
    and 2.650 kg of heroin in 50-gram packages” was recovered later, he/she
    also has a criminal record for supplying and distributing heroin in
    Zahedan and selling it in Tehran. It is unclear whether the evidence was
    used against all six defendants. Defense No information is available on
    Ms. Tavakkoli’s defense. Judgment One of the tribunals of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs in Tehran sentenced Ms.
    Tavakkoli to death and the Supreme Court approved the verdict. Ms. Nahid
    Tavakkoli and 24 other individuals were hanged at Qasr prison in Tehran on
    January 28, 1985.
