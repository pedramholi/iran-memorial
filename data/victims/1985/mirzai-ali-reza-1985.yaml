    The execution of Mr. Ali Reza Mirza’i, son of Mohammad Reza was published
    in the Kayhan newspaper on January 22, 1985. This report refers to him as
    a young man. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Mr. Mirza’i was tried at Branch
    17 of the Criminal Court of Tabriz. No other information is available on
    his trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Mirzaee was charged with
    “sodomy, an act which is incompatible with chastity.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mirza’i’s defense. Judgment Branch 17 of the Criminal
    Court of Tabriz sentenced Mr. Mirza’i to death. The Supreme Judicial
    Council confirmed this sentence. He was hanged in public at Namaz Circle
    on Jomhuri Eslami Street of Tabriz in the morning of January 21, 1985.
