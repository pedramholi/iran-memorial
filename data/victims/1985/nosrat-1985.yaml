    The execution of Ms. Nosrat, along with another defendant, was reported in
    the Kayhan daily on October 12, 1985. There is no mention of the
    defendant’s last name in this report. Mr. Hossein Nazari, accused of
    having relations with the two women, was also executed. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Ms. Nosrat was charged with “repeated
    counts of adultery with Hossein Nazari, who was executed.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Ms. Nosrat’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of the Army in Gilan sentenced Ms. Nosrat to death. An elected
    assembly of the Supreme Judicial Council approved the sentence; she was
    shot by a firing squad in Rasht.
