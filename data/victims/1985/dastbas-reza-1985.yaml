    Mr. Reza Dastbas, son of Hossein, is one of the 12028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The execution of Mr. Dastbas, along with 5 others,
    was announced in a communiqué of the public relations department of the
    revolutionary prosecution’s office of Tehran and reported in the Kayhan
    newspaper on June 17, 1985. The newspaper report refers to them as “six
    members of the small group of infidel Hypocrites that is at war with God.”
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges According to this communiqué, Mr. Dastbas was
    charged with being “a member of the terrorist Hypocrites organization
    [‘Hypocrites’: term Islamic Republic authorities used to refer to the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization], setting fire to a car, which belonged to
    the Ministry of Petroleum, participating an attempted assassination which
    resulted in wounding of a Revolutionary Guards brother, assassinating 2
    Hezbollahi persons [members of the Party of God] and wounding another, as
    well as destroying their workplaces, throwing bombs and grenades at the
    Elhadi Institution and wounding its librarian, throwing bombs at the
    Foundation of the Dispossessed [Bonyad-e Mostaz’afan] on Apadana Street
    and martyring its accountant, as well as wounding another brother.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against the accused. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Dastbas’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tehran sentenced Mr. Dastbas to death. He and 5 others were
    executed in Evin prison on June 15, 1985 “in the presence of the honorable
    family members of the persons that they have martyred.”
