    The execution of Mr. Omar Gol, citizen of Afghanistan, was reported in the
    Kayhan newspaper on April 8, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to
    this report, Mr. Gol was charged with first-degree murder. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the report, Mr. Gol “claimed that he had murdered his host in
    order to revenge his father’s blood.” Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Gol’s defense. Judgment Mr. Gol was sentenced to death. The Supreme
    Court approved the sentence. He was hanged in Qasr prison in Tehran.
