circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Qadir Samavati, son of Ruhollah, along with 6 others,
    was announced in a communiqué of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution’s
    Office of Kerman and reported in the Kayhan newspaper on May 21, 1985.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Mr. Samavati was tried at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman. No other information is available on the
    trial. Charges According to the report, Mr. Samavati was charged with
    “dealing and distributing heroin, participating in buying and transporting
    12.3 kg of heroin at the time of his arrest.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available on Mr. Samavati’s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman sentenced Mr.
    Samavati to death. The Islamic Revolutionary Supreme Court approved the
    sentence. He and ten other men were hanged on May 21, 1985 at prison of
    the Police Department of Kerman.
