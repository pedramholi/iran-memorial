    The execution of Mr. Iraj Khosravi Setizi, along with six others, was
    reported in the Kayhan Daily on February 2, 1985. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Khosravi Setizi was charged with “organizing an armed drug-trafficking
    gang, dealing and distributing 2200 kg of opium and weapon trading.”
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Khosravi Setizi’s defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman declared Mr. Khosravi Setizi a
    corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by
    the Islamic Revolution’s Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in
    the prison of the Police Headquarters at night.
