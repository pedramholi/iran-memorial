    The execution of Mr. Aziz Morad Faraz, son of Ali, along with 4 others,
    was reported in the Kayhan daily on November 17, 1985. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to the newspaper’s report, Mr. Faraz and four other
    individuals were collectively charged with “extortion and inhuman
    activities through terrorizing people with weapons.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution refers to the confession of the accused as
    evidence provided against the defendants. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense No information is available on Mr. Faraz’s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Bakhtaran (Kermanshah)
    sentenced Mr. Aziz Morad Faraz to death. The Supreme Judicial Council
    approved the sentence. He and four other individuals were executed at
    Dizel Abad prison in Bakhtaran on November 15, 1985.
