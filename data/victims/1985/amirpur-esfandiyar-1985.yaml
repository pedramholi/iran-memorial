    The execution of Mr. Esfandiyar Amirpoor, along with six others, was
    reported in the Kayhan Daily on February 2, 1985. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Amirpoor was charged with “participation in a drug-trafficking gang,
    direct collaboration with the armed members of the gang and dealing and
    distributing 400 kg of opium.” Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Amirpoor’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman
    declared Mr. Amirpoor a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death.
    Having been confirmed by the Islamic Revolution’s Supreme Court, the
    sentence was carried out in the prison of the Police Headquarters at
    night.
