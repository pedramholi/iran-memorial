    He opposed the Shah s regime from early in life, netting him an arrest at
    only 16. He would go on to serve on the secretariat of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization. Information about Mr. Jamshid Sepahvand is based on an
    interview with a person close to him. Mr. Sepahvand was married and a high
    school graduate. During the previous regime, in 1974, he was arrested when
    he was only 16. He was charged with acting against the national security
    and imprisoned until 1978. After the Revolution, he joined the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization and led the organization s secretariat. After the split
    in the organization, he joined the Majority. During the Revolution, he was
    active in Lorestan. In 1981, he moved to Tehran. He was arrested in
    November, 1981, in a memorial ceremony for Siamak Asadian (known as
    Eskandar, a guerilla activist of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization who was
    killed in October 1981 during clashes with the Revolutionary Guards). He
    was detained for nine months which he spent at Khoram Abad and Evin
    prisons. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist-Leninist group,
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin
    America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the Organization, which had
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority considered the
    Islamic Republic to be a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime and
    supported it. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic
    targeted its members solely because of their political beliefs. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Sepahvand was arrested again on November 9, 1983, along with
    his wife, in a friend s house in Tehran (his wife was released from prison
    one and a half years later). The Revolutionary Guards had a warrant for
    all the residents of the house, who were also arrested. Mr. Sepahvand was
    detained at Evin Prison, section 209. He was denied the right to have an
    attorney or access to his file. His first visitation with his parents took
    place four months after his arrest, but these visitations were
    discontinued. According to his cellmates, he was tortured severely and was
    a symbol of resistance in those years. The interviewee states that a
    corner of Sepahvand s eye was torn and one of his hands damaged. Trial Mr.
    Jamshid Sepahvand was tried at Evin in the winter of 1985. No further
    detail is available about the trial. After some time he was interrogated
    again when some of his friends, who were arrested, disclosed new
    information about him. Whether or not a second trial was held is not
    known. Charges The official charges brought against Mr. Jamshid Sepahvand
    are unknown. However, individuals familiar with this case state that his
    charges may have been membership of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization,
    apostasy, atheism, and activism in Kordestan. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available about his defense. Judgment Mr. Jamshid Sepahvand was executed
    on September 23, 1985, at Evin Prison. The day before the execution, when
    his family members went to Evin for visitation, they were taken inside the
    prison with a minibus and had a face-to-face visitation with him. The
    defendant asked them if they requested such a visitation. Their negative
    reply indicated that he was going to be executed.* Fifteen days later, his
    family went to Evin to visit. The prison officials gave them his bag and
    belongings and, only after the family s persistence, gave them directions
    to a grave in Behesht-e Zahra cemetery as the location of his interment.
    ------------------------------------ *Generally, visitations took place in
    the presence of prison guards. Communication with prisoners was done
    through a telephone from behind a glass divider. Face-to-face visitations
    (not from behind the glass divider) were rare and, if they occurred
    without prior request, they could indicate that the prisoner would be
    executed.
