    Mr. Mohammad Ali Arjmand Haqiqi, son of Gudarz, is one of the 12028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The execution of Mr.
    Arjmand Haqiqi, along with 5 others, was announced in a communiqué of the
    public relations department of the revolutionary prosecution’s office of
    Tehran and reported in the Kayhan newspaper on June 17, 1985. The
    newspaper report refers to them as “six members of the small group of
    infidel Hypocrites that is at war with God.” Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to this communiqué, Mr. Arjmand Haqiqi was charged with “being
    in charge of the preliminary measures in the terror cells of the
    Hypocrites small group which is at war with God [‘Hypocrites’: term
    Islamic Republic authorities used to refer to the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization], transportation of unauthorized weapons such as colts,
    grenades, hand bombs and RPG 7 and delivering them to another member of
    the abovementioned small group for their ominous plans.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available on Mr. Arjmand Haqiqi’s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran sentenced
    Mr. Arjmand Haqiqi to death. He and 5 others were executed in Evin prison
    on June 15, 1985 “in the presence of the honorable family members of the
    persons that they have martyred.”
