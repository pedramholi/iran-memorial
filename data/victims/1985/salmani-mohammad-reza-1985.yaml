    Mr. Mohammad Reza Salmani, son of Abolqasem, is one of the 12028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The execution of Mr.
    Salmani, along with 5 others, was announced in a communiqué of the public
    relations department of the revolutionary prosecution’s office of Tehran
    and reported in the Kayhan newspaper on June 17, 1985. The newspaper
    report refers to them as “six members of the small group of infidel
    Hypocrites that is at war with God.” Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to this communiqué, Mr. Salmani was charged with being “a member
    of the terror cells of the Hypocrites organization [‘Hypocrites’: term
    Islamic Republic authorities used to refer to the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization], participating in three assassination operations, martyring
    and wounding 3 persons of the Hezbollahi [Party of God] nation, and
    attacking the Islamic Revolution’s Chief Public Prosecutor by an RPG 7.”
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against the accused. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Salmani’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tehran sentenced Mr. Salmani to death. He and 5 others were
    executed in Evin prison on June 15, 1985 “in the presence of the honorable
    family members of the persons that they have martyred.”
