    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Akbari, along with 14 others, was announced in
    a communiqué by the Intelligence Office of Mazandaran. Mr. Ahmad Akbari is
    also among the 282 individuals listed in a United Nations Report on The
    Situation of Human Right in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Note by the
    Secretary General), published on 13 November 1985. The report lists these
    individuals as "Persons who were allegedly summarily and arbitrarily
    executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran: 1984-1985."The communiqué was
    published in the Kayhan daily on March 11, 1985. The communiqué is as
    follows: “In the Name of God Due to the favors of God and the wise advice
    of our respectful Imam about ending the Forest commotion, as well as the
    continuous efforts and sacrifices of the Islamic Revolution’s
    Revolutionary Guards, the hellish spidery organization of the hypocrites
    was destroyed in the verdant forests of Mazandaran. And all the partisans
    of estekbar (arrogance) were seized by the wrath of the avenging and
    omnipotent God. Away from their fugitive leaders, the traitors abroad, and
    their treacherous clamor, all the members were captured by the valiant men
    of Islam.” Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges The communiqué does not specify the charges
    against Mr. Akbari. All 14 defendants are collectively charged with:
    “membership in the hypocrites organization (term used for the Mujahedin-e
    Khalq Organization by the Islamic Republic authorities), martyring an
    unarmed shepherd who refused to collaborate with them with a knife and
    poniard - not shooting him in order not to waste a bullet-, martyring 6
    members of Basij (Mobilization Forces) of Qaemshahr cruelly while they
    were asleep, as well as committing tens of crimes resulting in 21 martyrs
    and 23 wounded.” Evidence of guilt There is no evidence presented in the
    communiqué that specifically incriminates Mr. Akbari. According to the
    communiqué all the defendants were implicated through both their
    confessions during the trial in front of the families of those killed, and
    weapons found during search and seizure by the revolutionary guards. The
    report explains: “upon searching the shelters of the defendants, the
    revolutionary guards found: “tens of war weapons, military grenades,
    cyanide, ‘se rahi’ (kind of explosive), walkie-talkies, and two military
    compasses, in addition to, many cartridges.” There is no mention of the
    specifics of these confessions. Defense No information is available on
    Mr.Akbari’s defense. Judgment Mr. Akbari was sentenced to death. There is
