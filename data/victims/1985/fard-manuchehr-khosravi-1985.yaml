    The execution of Mr. Manuchehr Khosravi Fard, son of Ali Reza, along with
    24 others, was reported in the Kayhan daily on January 28, 1985. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial,
    other than Mr. Khosravi Fard was tried at one of the tribunals of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office to combat Drugs in Tehran.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Khosravi Fard and two other
    individuals were collectively charged with “being greatly and continuously
    active in supplying and distributing narcotics… storing 13 kg opium and
    selling it, supplying 38 kg of opium and selling it.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution states that “9.397 kg of opium was recovered”
    from Mr. Khosravi Fard and his two co-defendants. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Khosravi Fard’s defense. Judgment One of the tribunals
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office to combat Drugs in Tehran
    sentenced Mr. Khosravi Fard to death and the Supreme Court approved the
    verdict. Mr. Manuchehr Khosravi Fard and 24 other individuals were hanged
    at Qasr prison in Tehran on January 28, 1985.
