    The execution of Mr. Aziz Noruzi was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on
    December 25, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Mr. Noruzi was tried
    at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kashan (Esfahan province). No
    further information is available on the trial. Charges According to the
    report, Mr. Noruzi was charged with murder. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Noruzi’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Kashan sentenced Mr. Noruzi to death. The Supreme Judicial
    Council approved the sentence. Mr. Noruzi was executed in public.
