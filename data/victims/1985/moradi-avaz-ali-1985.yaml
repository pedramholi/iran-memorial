    The execution of Mr. Avaz Ali Moradi was reported in the Kayhan newspaper
    on May 23, 1985, quoting the public relations of Esfahan’s Justice
    Department. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Moradi was
    charged with first-degree murder. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Moradi’s defense. Judgment The Public Court of Esfahan sentenced Mr.
    Moradi to death. The Supreme Court and the High Judicial Council approved
    the sentence. Mr. Moradi was executed in the presence of the Prosecutor’s
    Deputy at prison of the Police Department Prison in Esfahan.
