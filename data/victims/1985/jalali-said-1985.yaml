    Mr. Sa’id Jalali, son of Jahangir, is one of the 12028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The execution of Mr. Jalali, along with 5 others,
    was announced in a communiqué of the public relations department of the
    revolutionary prosecution’s office of Tehran and reported in the Kayhan
    newspaper on June 17, 1985. The newspaper report refers to them as “six
    members of the small group of infidel Hypocrites that is at war with God.”
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges According to this communiqué, Mr. Jalali was
    charged with being “the commander of the terror cells of the Hypocrites
    [term Islamic Republic authorities used to refer to the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization], participating in 4 assassination operations, attack on
    Hezbollahi brothers [members of the Party of God] having wounded 3 and
    martyred 2, and participating in throwing an RPG-7 at the Chief Public
    Prosecutor.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Jalali’s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran sentenced Mr. Jalali to death. He and 5
    others were executed in Evin prison on June 15, 1985 “in the presence of
    the honorable family members of the persons that they have martyred.”
