    The information about Mr. Ali Jahani, affiliated with the Kurdish
    Democratic Party of Iran, has been drawn from an electronic form sent to
    Omid by his daughter. The Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI) was
    founded in 1945 with the objective to gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in
    north-west of Iran. After the Revolution, conflicts between the new
    central Shiite government and the mainly Sunni Kurdistan, regarding the
    role of minorities in the drafting of the constitution, specification of
    Shiite as the official state religion, and particularly the autonomy of
    the region, ended in armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and
    the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum
    of April 1, when people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic
    regime. On August 19, 1979 Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the “party
    of Satan” and declared it “unofficial and illegal.” Mass executions and
    fighting broke out and continued for several months in the region. By
    1983, PDKI had lost much of its influence in the region. Various leaders
    of the PDKI have been assassinated. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Jahani’s arrest and detention are not known other than he was
    arrested in Azad village. Trial There is no information regarding this
    trial other than it took place in Tehran and the proceedings lasted for 5
    months. Charges The charges brought against the defendant are not known.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence
    presented against the accused. Defense No information is available
    concerning Mr. Jahani’s defense. According to the electronic form, at the
    time when the alleged crime was committed, Mr. Jahani was in prison.
    Judgment No specific information is available about the verdict leading to
    this execution. Mr. Ali Jahani was hanged on December 19, 1985.
