    The execution of Mr. Baba Soleimanian was reported in the Kayhan Daily on
    January 24, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant
    s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Soleimanian
    was charged with murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. It notes however that the defendant had
    committed the crime after the family of the girl he loved and wanted to
    marry rejected him. Defense No information is available on Mr. Soleimanian
    s defense. Judgment Tabriz s Penal Court I sentenced Mr. Soleimanian to
    death. The sentence was carried out by one of the victim s relatives in
    the premises of the gendarmerie at dawn.
