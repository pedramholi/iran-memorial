    The execution of Mr. Gol Mohammad Nahtani, along with 13 others, was
    reported in the Kayhan Daily on May 23, 1985. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Nahtani was “a professional smuggler.” Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Nahtani’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Birjand
    sentenced Mr. Nahtani to death. After having been confirmed by the Supreme
    Court, the sentence was carried out.
