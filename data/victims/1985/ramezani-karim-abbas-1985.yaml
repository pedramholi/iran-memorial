circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Abbas Ramezani-Karim, son of Akbar, along with 12
    others, was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on October 22, 1985. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Ramezani-Karim was charged with
    “smuggling drugs for 8 years and buying and selling 830 kg of opium since
    the last time he was arrested.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution mentions that Mr. Ramezani-Karim had a criminal record. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Ramezani-Karim’s defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman declared Mr. Ramezani-Karim a
    “corruptor on earth” and sentenced him to death. The Islamic Revolution’s
    Supreme Court confirmed the sentenced. He and 12 other individuals were
    hanged in the prison of the Police Department of Kerman on October 22,
    1985.
