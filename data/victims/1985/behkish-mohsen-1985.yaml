    The information about Mr. Mohsen Behkish is based on an interview with a
    person close to him. He was a high school graduate and a sympathizer of
    the Fadayian Khalq Organization (Minority). In 1981, in order to escape
    the prosecution, he had to move and live in different cities. His sister,
    Zhara, a sympathizer of the same organization, died under torture in 1983.
    One of his brothers, Mohammad Ali, another sympathizer of the Fadayian
    Khalq Organization (Minority), was executed in 1988. His brother,
    Mohammad, was killed extra-judicially in 1981. Another brother, Mahmud, a
    sympathizer of the Fadayian Khalq Organization (Majority), was executed in
    1988. The Fadayian Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired
    by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America,
    was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 Revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadayian Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and
    was mainly active in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest

    of the Joint Committee in his parents’ house sometimes after August 25,
    1983. After entering the house, the Guards attacked him immediately and
    battered him in front of his parents in order for him to surrender the
    weapons that they thought he possessed. His detention places were the
    Joint Committee, Evin, and the Revolutionary Guards Base in Mashhad. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge
