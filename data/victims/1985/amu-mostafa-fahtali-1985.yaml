    The execution of Mr. Mostafa Fath’ali Amu, son of Mohammad Taqi, along

    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial, other than Mr. Fath’ali Amu was tried at one of the
    tribunals of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs
    in Tehran. Charges According to this report, Mr. Fath’ali Amu and three
    other defendants were collectively charged with “being highly active in
    supplying and distributing heroin, dealing 13.5 kg of heroin.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the report, Mr. Fath’ali Amu has
    had “10 convictions for supplying and distributing narcotics.” Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Fath’ali Amu’s defense. Judgment One of
    the tribunals of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat
    Drugs in Tehran sentenced Mr. Fath’ali Amu to death and the Supreme Court
    approved the verdict. Mr. Mostafa Fath’ali Amu and 24 other individuals
    were hanged at Qasr prison in Tehran on January 28, 1985.
