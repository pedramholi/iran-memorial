    The execution of Mr. Ali Asghar Molla-Hosseinzadeh, son of Gholam Ali,
    along with 10 others, was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on May 21,
    1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial Mr. Molla-Hosseinzadeh was tried at the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman. No other information is
    available on the trial. Charges According to the report, Mr.
    Molla-Hosseinzadeh was charged with “participation in an armed robbery,
    supplying and storing weapons, attacking the officers, being a member of
    the smuggling gang of the Molla-Hosseinzadeh brothers and drug dealing.”
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the report, Mr. Molla-Hosseinzadeh
    had a “criminal record.” Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Molla-Hosseinzadeh’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    of Kerman sentenced Mr. Molla-Hosseinzadeh to death. The Islamic
    Revolutionary Supreme Court approved the sentence. He and ten other men
    were hanged on May 21, 1985 at prison of the Police Department of Kerman.
