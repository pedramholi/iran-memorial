    The execution of Mr. Rahim Rahimi, an Afghani citizen, was reported in the
    Kayhan daily on March 4, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Rahimi was charged with “first-degree murder.of 2 Iranians and armed
    robbery” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rahimi's
    defense. Judgment The 13th division of Shiraz’s Penal Court sentenced Mr.
    Rahimi to death. After being confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence
    was carried out.
