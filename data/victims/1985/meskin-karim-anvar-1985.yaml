    The execution of Mr. Karim Anvar Meskin, son of Ahmad, along with 24
    others, was reported in the Kayhan daily on January 28, 1985. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial,
    other than Mr. Anvar Meskin was tried at one of the tribunals of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs in Tehran.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Anvar Meskin and two other
    defendants were collectively charged with “being highly and continuously
    active in supplying and distributing heroin, transporting 7.5 kg of heroin
    from Orumieh to Tehran and selling it at two different times, storing
    1.450 kg of heroin at Ebrahim’s house [one of the defendants] and storing
    more than 9 kg of heroin at home.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the
    report, Mr. Anvar Meskin has had “a criminal record for supplying and
    distributing heroin.” Defense No information is available on Mr. Anvar
    Meskin’s defense. Judgment One of the tribunals of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs in Tehran sentenced Mr.
    Anvar Meskin to death and the Supreme Court approved the verdict. Mr.
    Karim Anvar Meskin and 24 other individuals were hanged at Qasr prison in
    Tehran on January 28, 1985.
