    the Kayhan Daily on April 23, 1985. The validity of the criminal charges

    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
