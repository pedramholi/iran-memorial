circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Reza Hojabr Roshan, son of Shir Ali, along with 6
    others, was announced in a communiqué of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecution’s Office of Kerman and reported in the Kayhan newspaper on May
    21, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Mr. Hojabr Roshan was tried at
    the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman. No other information is
    available on the trial. Charges According to the report, Mr. Hojabr Roshan
    was charged with “dealing and distributing 2.25 kg of heroin as well as
    buying and transporting 10.3 kg of heroin.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hojabr Roshan’s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman sentenced
    Mr. Hojabr Roshan to death. The Islamic Revolutionary Supreme Court
    approved the sentence. He and ten other men were hanged on May 21, 1985 at
    prison of the Police Department of Kerman.
