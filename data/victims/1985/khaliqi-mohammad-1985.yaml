    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Khaliqi, son of Ahmad, along with 10 others,
    was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on May 21, 1985. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Mr. Khaliqi was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Kerman. No other information is available on the trial. Charges According
    to the report, Mr. Khaliqi was charged with “direct participation in an
    armed robbery, stealing 7 million tomans cash from the National Bank,
    shooting at officers, 4 house robberies, as well as two attempted house
    robberies.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the report,
    Mr. Khaliqi had a “criminal record.” Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Khaliqi’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Kerman sentenced Mr. Khaliqi to death. The Islamic Revolutionary Supreme
    Court approved the sentence. The newspaper report states that “the
    defendant was also sentenced to hand amputation. However, the plaintiffs
    declared that since he was to be executed, they would forgo hand
    amputation.” Mr. Khaliqi and ten other men were hanged on May 21, 1985 at
    prison of the Police Department of Kerman.
