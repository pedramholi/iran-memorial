    Information about the execution of Mr. Rahmatollah Vojdani (also spelled "
    Rahmatu'llah Vujdani") was obtained from a biography published in the
    Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran. Additional information was drawn
    from a reuters report published in Ettelaat daily on 27 February 1974.
    Rahmatollah Vojdani is also one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a
    1993 report published by the Baha i International Community. The report
    documents the persecution of the members of the Baha i faith in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran and lists those killed since 1978. Additional
    information has been drawn from various issues of The Baha i World . See
    for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Mr. Vojdani was born in 1928
    in Bandar, Abbas (ABPI, Bio). He was employed as a teacher by the Ministry
    of Education for a time, but due to persecution over his Baha i faith he
    was forced to change jobs frequently. Little is known about Mr. Vojdani s
    family except that he had lost his 22-year old son Faramarz who studied in
    the philippines in 1972. According to the Philippines Federal Bureau of
    Investigation, Faramarz Vojdani and two other students were found dead
    with mutilated bodies after having a heated debate with a group of Muslims
    from the southern part of the Philippines in the Lanao del Sur region.
    Five Muslims were persecuted for their murder in 1974. (Ettelaat, 27
    February, 1974) The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background
    The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979 (1) - to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence. (2) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the
    Baha i threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national
    security in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and
    Detention Mr. Vojdani was arrested on July 24th, 1984 and detained in
    Bandar Abbas. He was transferred to Evin Prison in Tehran before being
    returned to Bandar Abbas. According to information on the Baha i
    Persecution in Iran website, Mr. Vojdani was tortured during his
    imprisonment (ABPI). Trial There is no information about a trial held for
    Mr. Vojdani. Charges There is no information about the charges against Mr.
    Vojdani. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence There is no information
    about evidence used by the prosecution. Defense There is no information
    about Mr. Vojdani s defense The representatives of the Baha'i community
    stress that their members are being persecuted for their religious
    beliefs. They refute the validity of charges such as counter-revolutionary
    political activities or spying leveled against them in Iranian courts.
    They point out that the fundamental principles of their religion require
    them to show loyalty and obedience to their government and refrain from
    any political involvement. They believe that the accusation of espionage
    for Israel is unfounded and based solely on the fact that the Baha'i World
    Center is in Israel. They point out that this center was established on
    Mount Carmel in the late 19t
