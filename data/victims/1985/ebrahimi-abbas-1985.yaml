circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Abbas Ebrahimi, son of Ali, along with 12 others, was
    reported in the Kayhan newspaper on October 22, 1985. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Ebrahimi was charged with “drug trafficking
    for 20 years.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution mentions that Mr.
    Ebrahimi had a criminal record and carried 20 kg of opium at the time of
    arrest. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ebrahimi’s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman declared Mr.
    Ebrahimi a “corruptor on earth” and sentenced him to death. The Islamic
    Revolution’s Supreme Court confirmed the sentenced. He and 12 other
    individuals were hanged in the prison of the Police Department of Kerman
    on October 22, 1985.
