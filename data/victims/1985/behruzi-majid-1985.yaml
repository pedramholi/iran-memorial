    The executions of Mr. Majid Behruzi and another defendant were reported in
    the Kayhan daily on May 18, 1985. The newspaper referred to them as
    members of the Babak crime ring. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to the newspaper,
    Mr. Behruzi and his co-defendant were collectively charged with
    “kidnapping and seducing adolescents in Shiraz.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Behruzi’s defense. Judgment Mr. Majid Behruzi was hanged
    in public in Shiraz on May 17, 1985.
