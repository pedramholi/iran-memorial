    The execution of Mr. Khosro Azadi, along with two others, was reported in
    the Kayhan daily on May 19, 1985. The newspaper refers to these men as
    “members of a crime ring called Babak.” The news story also mentions two
    other members of the gang had been executed 2 days before. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Azadi was charged with “kidnapping
    and molesting adolescents in Shiraz.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Azadi’s defense. Judgment The 13th branch of Shiraz’s Penal Court
    sentenced Mr. Azadi to death. The Supreme Court approved the sentence. Mr.
    Khosro Azadi was executed along with two other men.
