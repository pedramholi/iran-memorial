    The information about Mr. Jahangir Behtaji has been collected through an
    interview with one of his relatives. (ABC interview) Additional
    information used in this page is based on research done by Abdorrahman
    Broumand Center. (ABC research) Mr. Behtaji studied agriculture at Shiraz
    University, where he was an anti-monarchy student activist. He was
    arrested in the early 1970s and, after some detention time at Kazerun
    prison in the Fars province, he was dismissed from the University and sent
    to Yazd to serve in the army as a private. After completing his military
    service and a short detention period, he enrolled at Tehran University as
    a biology major student. He was purged from the University during the
    Cultural Revolution in the spring of 1980. (ABC interview) The Cultural
    Revolution began after Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech in March 1980 and
    ordered that universities be purged of all those who opposed his regime
    and be transformed into learning environments [as opposed to political
    forums] where an all-Islamic curriculum is taught. The first wave of
    violence began on April 15, 1980 during a speech by Akbar Hashemi
    Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister
    of Interior] at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech, students
    supporting the regime took control of the University s central building
    and demanded that the university be purged from pro-Shah elements and
    other sellouts. On April 18th, the Council of the Islamic Revolution
    issued a communiqu accusing political groups of converting higher
    education institutions into headquarters of discordant political
    activities and naming them as obstacles to the radical transformation of
    the universities. The communiqu gave these groups three days (Saturday
    April 19 to Monday April 21) to shut down their activities in the
    universities. The Council stressed that the decision included libraries
    along with activities related to arts and sports. Before the end of the
    Council s deadline, serious clashes started between the Islamist
    associations, sometimes supported by security forces and paramilitary
    groups, and leftist student groups. The latter, which recruited members
    and had strong support in the universities, refused to evacuate. These
    clashes, which peaked at the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in
    the death of several people and the wounding of hundreds of others on
    university campuses around the country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic
    authorities announced the victory of the Cultural Revolution and the
    closure of all universities in order to Islamicize the curricula. The
    universities remained closed for two years. One of the outcomes of the
    Cultural Revolution was the purging of many university professors and
    students based on their political beliefs. (ABC research) When he was a
    student, Mr. Behtaji became a supporter of guerilla groups and during the
    Revolution he expanded his activism. His main area of activism was
    publication and distribution of Marxist flyers and books. After the
    Revolution, he became a member of Fadayian Khalq Organization Majority.
    Mr. Behtaji was known for his compassionate nature and modesty. He always
    helped others in any way he could. After the news of his execution spread,
    for 40 days his acquaintances went to visit his wife and mother to express
    their condolences. (ABC interview) The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Majority considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and
    anti-imperialist regime and supported it. After the spring of 1983,
    however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely because of their
    political beliefs. (ABC research) Arrest and detention Mr. Behtaji was
    arrested, late in the evening, on the 21st of June 1983 and taken to Evin
    prison. The location of his detention was not disclosed to his family.
    They made numerous inquiries at various government agencies and prisons
    until they found out that he was at Evin hospital through the receipt of
    money they had sent him. (When the family of a detainee was allowed, they
    could send money to the prisoner and they would obtain a receipt one or
    two weeks later. The receipt was signed by the prisoner and stamped with
    the stamp of the prison. By this means, the family would find out the
    location of detention and whether or not the prisoner was still alive.)
    (ABC Interview) During his first months at Evin, when most likely he was
    often interrogated, he did not have visitation rights. Later he was
    transferred to Gohar Dasht prison in Tehran province, where he was in
    solitary confinement for one year. Then he was returned to Evin. His
    family would not be informed o
