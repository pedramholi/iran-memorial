    During the reign of the Shah, Mr. Shahverdilu was a police officer in the
    division responsible for dealing with terrorist groups and saboteurs.
    After the revolution, he was one of the first people they came to arrest.
    Information regarding the life and the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Behruz
    Shahverdilu has been collected from an electronic form sent to Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center by one of his relatives (July 12, 2006), Army Monthly
    Publication Attachment #1, a publication of the military branch of the
    National Resistance Movement of Iran (March 1986), Pezhvak-e-Iran website
    (May 23, 2016), and from Turkish language newspapers Milliyet (May 8,
    2000), and Cumhurriyat (May 13 and October 25, 1986, February 12, 1989,
    March 16, 1990, and October 29, 1991). According to available information,
    Mr. Shahverdilu was born in Reza ieh in 1942. His elementary and secondary
    education was at the Police Officers Academy. He finished the three-year
    course of the Police Officers College at the top of his class as a Second
    Lieutenant. He started his service with the police and worked his way up
    to Major. He was married in 1967 and he had three children. According to
    his friends Mr. Shahverdilu was a brave man. (Pezhvak-e-Iran). During the
    reign of the Shah, he was a police officer in the division responsible for
    dealing with terrorist groups and saboteurs and also airplane hijackings.
    He was wounded several times during these operations (Army Monthly
    Publication Attachment #1). After the Revolution of 1979, Mr. Shahverdilu
    was one of the first people they came to arrest. He was able to escape
    while his home was surrounded by agents. During the time he was trying to
    evade secret agents and the Khomeini Regime s Guards (Pasdaran), his
    hiding place was discovered eleven times. Eventually he was able to leave
    through the mountains in 1979, and to seek asylum in a neighboring country
    (Turkiye). (Army Monthly Publication Attachment #1) After fleeing Iran,
    Mr. Shahverdilu joined the National Resistance Movement of Iran, abroad,
    and worked with them for over five years. He was in charge of one of the
    rescue teams of the military branch of the Resistance Movement of Iran
    (Army Monthly Publication Attachment #1) Background of Extrajudicial
    Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has
    a long history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the
    world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and
    outside the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing
    a large number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable.
    The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is
    not clear; however, these murders began in February 1979 and have
    continued since then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran
    attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been
    assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
    in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France,
    Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in
    Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases
    there has not been much published and the local authorities have not
    issued arrest warrants. But documentation, evidence, and traces obtained
    through investigations conducted by local police and judicial authorities
    confirm, however, the theory of state committed crimes. In certain cases,
    these investigations have resulted in the expulsion or arrest of Iranian
    diplomats. In limited cases outside Iran, the perpetrators of these
    murders have been arrested and put on trial and the evidence presented,
    revealed the defendants connection to Iran s government institutions, and
    an arrest warrant has been issued for Iran s Minister of Information. The
    manner in which these killings were organized and implemented in Iran and
    abroad, is indicative of a single pattern which, according to Roland
    Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor, contains common parameters and detailed
    planning. It can be ascertained from the similarities between these
    murders in different countries that the Iranian government is the
    principal entity who ordered the implementation of these crimes. Iranian
    authorities have not officially accepted responsibility for these murders
    and have even attributed their commission to internal strife in opposition
    groups. Nevertheless, since the very inception of the Islamic Republic
    regime, the Islamic Republic officials have justified these crimes from an
    ideological and legal standpoint. In the spring of 1979, Sadeq Khalkhali,
    the first Chief Shari a Judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts,
    officially announced the regime s decision to implement extrajudicial
    executions, and justified the decision: These people have been sentenced
    to death; from the Iranian peop
