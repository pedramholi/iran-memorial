    The execution of Mr. Hossein Kerdarian, son of Abbas, along with 24

    Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs in Tehran. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Kerdarian was charged with “being greatly
    and continuously active in supplying and distributing heroin, buying 150 g
    of heroin and selling it in 5-gram packages for 2 years.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the report, Mr. Kerdarian has had “a criminal record for
    supplying and distributing heroin and was in possession of 37 g of heroin
    when he was arrested.” Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Kerdarian’s defense. Judgment One of the tribunals of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs in Tehran sentenced Mr.
    Kerdarian to death and the Supreme Court approved the verdict. Mr. Hossein
    Kerdarian and 24 other individuals were hanged at Qasr prison in Tehran on
    January 28, 1985.
