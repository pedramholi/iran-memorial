    The execution of Mr. Ali Nazbaqeri, son of Amanollah, was reported in the
    Kayhan daily on December 16, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial, other than he was tried
    at Branch 14 of the Penal Court of Shiraz, Division One. Charges According
    to this report, Mr. Nazbaqeri was charged with murder. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Nazbaqeri’s defense. Judgment Branch 14 of the Penal
    Court of Shiraz condemned Mr. Nazbaqeri to death and the Supreme Court
    approved the verdict. Mr. Ali Nazbaqeri was executed at Adelabad prison in
    Shiraz.
