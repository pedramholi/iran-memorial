    The execution of Mr. Jamshid Heidari Adl and his brother Reza, sons of
    Mohammad, was announced in a communiqué of the public relations office of
    the Supreme Judicial Council and published in the Kayhan newspaper on
    March 6, 1985. The two brothers were also among the 282 individuals listed
    in a United Nations Report on The Situation of Human Right in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran (Note by the Secretary General), published on 13 November
    1985. The report lists these individuals as “Persons who were allegedly
    summarily and arbitrarily executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    1984-1985.” Moreover, they were two of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The communiqué of the public relations office of the
    Supreme Judicial Council called Mr. Heidari Adl and his brother “two of
    the active members of the terrorist group-let of Hypocrites,” referring to
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahed magazine confirms that these
    individuals were both affiliated with this Organization. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Heidari Adl’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial There is no information regarding this trial, other than
    he was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran. Charges
    According to the abovementioned communiqué, Mr. Heidari Adl and his
    brother were collectively charged with: “active membership in the
    group-let of hypocrites, being in charge of organizing the Hypocrites’
    clashes in illegal demonstrations, starting clashes with the Hezbollah
    Umma [Party of God Nation] and active participation in these clashes,
    stealing foreigners’ passports in order to use them for their own ominous
    plans, hijacking an Airbus plane to land it in Iraq, attacking the plane’s
    cockpit as well as the Law Enforcement Officers, which resulted in
    martyring a Hezbollahi brother and wounding two brothers of the
    Revolutionary Guards. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense No
    information is available concerning Mr. Heidari Adl’s defense. Judgment
    The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran sentenced Mr. Jamshid Heidary
    Adl to death. He and his brother were shot by a firing squad on March 5,
    1985 at Evin prison.
