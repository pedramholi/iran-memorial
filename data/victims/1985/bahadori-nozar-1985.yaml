    Mr. Nozar Bahadori, a high school graduate majoring in mathematics and
    physics, and a member of the Ettehadieh Kominist-ha, is one of the 12028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Additional information
    was sent through electronic form by a person close to Mr. Bahadori. The
    Ettehadieh Komonist-ha was created by exiled opponents of the Pahlavi
    regime who mostly belonged to the Student Confederation. They followed the
    teachings of Mao Tse-Tung and did not believe in guerilla warfare. The
    group became marked by ideological divides during the periods preceding
    and following the 1979 revolution which caused it to split into several
    factions. One of the most important rifts was triggered by the decision by
    a number of members to take up arms and take over a city in Iran. The
    uprising plan, devised in the midst of an active and violent
    anti-communist campaign by the revolutionary Islamic government, split the
    Ettehadieh in two factions: one believing in the armed movement and the
    other opposing it. Arrest and detention The defendant was arrested in his
    home in Masjed Soleyman (Khuzestan province) in 1981 at 9 a.m. No other
    information regarding his arrest and detention is available. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Bahadori are not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms.
    Bahadori’s defense. Judgment Mr. Nozar Bahadori was reportedly sentenced
    to 6 months in prison by a local tribunal. His sentence was later changed
    to 3 years and finally he was sentenced to death. No other information is
    available on the judicial process leading to his execution. He was shot by
    a firing squad on February 20, 1985.
