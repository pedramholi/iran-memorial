    The execution of Mr. Shah Karam Orkideh was reported in the Kayhan daily
    on May 13, 1985. Arrest and detention He was arrested on September 25,
    1984 when intending to commit armed robbery with 5 other robbers. No
    further information is available regarding the circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Orkideh was
    charged with “9 counts of armed robbery in Karaj and its suburb, the
    first-degree murder of Kamel Afghani, terrorizing people, disrupting the
    society, and establishing an armed-robbery gang.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Orkideh’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Karaj sentenced Mr. Shah Karam Orkideh to death. He was
    executed in Karaj.
