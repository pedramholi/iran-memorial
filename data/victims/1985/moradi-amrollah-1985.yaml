    The execution of Mr. Amrollah Moradi was reported in the Kayhan newspaper
    on April 9, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr.
    Moradi was charged with first-degree murder of his wife. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Moradi’s defense. Judgment Branch 56 of the Penal Court
    sentenced Mr. Amrollah Moradi to death. The Supreme Court approved the
    sentence. He was executed in Qasr prison in Tehran.
