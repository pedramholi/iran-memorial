circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Reza Timas, son of Feyz Mohammad, along with 12
    others, was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on October 22, 1985. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Timas was charged with “having
    contacts with armed smugglers, storing ammunitions and dealing 985 g of
    heroin, as well as one bag of opium.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Timas’s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman declared
    Mr. Timas a “corruptor on earth” and sentenced him to death. The Islamic
    Revolution’s Supreme Court confirmed the sentenced. He and 12 other
    individuals were hanged in the prison of the Police Department of Kerman
    on October 22, 1985.
