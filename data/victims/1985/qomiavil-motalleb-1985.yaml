    The execution of Mr. Motalleb Qomiavil, son of Ali, along with 24 others,
    was reported in the Kayhan daily on January 28, 1985. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial, other than Mr.
    Qomiavil was tried at one of the tribunals of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs in Tehran. Charges According to this
    report, Mr. Qomiavil was charged with “possessing 435 g of heroin when
    arrested, being highly active in supplying and distributing narcotics,
    distributing heroin in 50 and 100-gram packages, buying 1.320 kg.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the report Mr. Qomiavil has had “3
    previous convictions for supplying and distributing heroin and drug
    addiction and he was also in possession of 435 g of heroin at the time of
    his arrest. Defense No information is available on Mr. Qomiavil’s defense.
    Judgment One of the tribunals of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution
    Office to Combat Drugs in Tehran sentenced Mr. Qomiavil to death and the
    Supreme Court approved the verdict. Mr. Motalleb Qomiavil and 24 other
    individuals were hanged at Qasr prison in Tehran on January 28, 1985.
