    The execution of Mr. Yusef Ali Yusefnejad was reported in the Kayhan
    newspaper on January 14, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Yusefnejad was charged with first-degree murder. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the report, Mr. Yusefnejad confessed to the crime after his
    arrest. International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned
    the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. In the case of political detainees, these confessions are,
    at times, televised. The National Television broadcasts confessions during
    which prisoners plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and
    renounce their political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights
    organizations have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by
    those prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Yusefnejad’s defense. Judgment Branch 8 of Penal Court sentenced Mr.
    Yusefnejad to death. Having received 80 lashes, he was publicly hanged at
    7:20 a.m. on January 14, 1985 at Mahabad Circle in Orumieh.
