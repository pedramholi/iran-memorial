    The execution of Mr. Hassan Bazarani, son of Rashid, along with 24 others,
    was reported in the Kayhan daily on January 28, 1985. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial, other than Mr.
    Bazarani was tried at one of the tribunals of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs in Tehran. Charges According to this
    report, Mr. Bazarani and another defendant were collectively charged with
    “possessing 2.90 kg of heroin when arrested, selling 6 kg of heroin to the
    officers, selling 20-gram packages of heroin several times, being greatly
    and continuously active in supplying and distributing heroin”. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to this report, Mr. Bazarani has had
    “a criminal record for supplying and distributing narcotics” Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Bazarani’s defense. Judgment One of the
    tribunals of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs
    in Tehran sentenced Mr. Bazarani to death and the Supreme Court approved
    the verdict. Mr. Hassan Bazarani and 24 other individuals were hanged at
    Qasr prison in Tehran on January 28, 1985.
