    The execution of Mr. Hassanollah Rasuli, son of Sa’id, along with 24
    others, was reported in the Kayhan daily on January 28, 1985. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial,
    other than Mr. Rasuli was tried at one of the tribunals of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs in Tehran. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Rasuli and another defendant were
    collectively charged with “possessing 2.90 kg of heroin when arrested,
    selling 6 kg of heroin to the officers, selling 20-gram packages of heroin
    several times, being greatly and continuously active in supplying and
    distributing heroin”. Mr. Rasuli was reportedly an “armed smuggler.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to this report, Mr. Rasuli has had “a
    criminal record for supplying and distributing narcotics” Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Rasuli’s defense. Judgment One of the
    tribunals of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs
    in Tehran sentenced Mr. Rasuli to death and the Supreme Court approved the
    verdict. Mr. Hassanollah Rasuli and 24 other individuals were hanged at
    Qasr prison in Tehran on January 28, 1985.
