    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Hossein Naruee, along with six others, was
    reported in the Kayhan Daily on February 2, 1985. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Naruee was charged with “organizing a drug-trafficking gang, buying
    narcotics outside Iran's borders, importing it to the mountain area around
    Kerman, distributing approximately 30 tons of opium and weapon trading.”
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Naruee’s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman declared Mr. Naruee a corruptor on earth
    and sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by the Islamic
    Revolution’s Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in the prison of
    the Police Headquarters at night.
