    The execution of Mr. Hossein Sotudeh was reported in the Kayhan daily on
    January 16, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr.
    Sotudeh was charged with murder. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Sotudeh’s defense. Judgment Branch One of the Penal Court of Khoramabad
    sentenced Mr. Hossein Sotudeh to death. The Supreme Court approved the
    sentence and Mr. Sotudeh was executed on January 15, 1985 in Khoramabad.
