    The execution of Mr. Mahmud Tavakkolpur, son of Hossein was reported in
    the Kayhan newspaper on June 24, 1985. According to this report, he was a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Mr. Tavakkolpur was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Arak. No further information is available on the trial. Charges According
    to this report, Mr. Tavakkolpur was charged with “assassination of Mostafa
    Haqshenas, the former head of Islamic Revolutionary Committee of Arak,
    identifying and assassinating members of the Hezbollah [Party of God],
    several times and throwing grenades at the library of the Islamic
    Association.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the report, Mr. Tavakkolpur
    confessed to his crimes during his trial. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense No information is available on Mr. Tavakkolpur’s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Arak sentenced Mr.
    Tavakolpur to death. The Supreme Court approved the sentence. He was
    hanged in public in Arak.
