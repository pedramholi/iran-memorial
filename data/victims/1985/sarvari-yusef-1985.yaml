    The execution of Mr. Yusef Sarvari, son of Ahmad and born in and resident
    of Bandar Anzali (Gilan province) was reported in the Kayhan daily on
    November 17, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial, other than he was tried at Branch 1 of
    the Penal Court of Bandar Anzali. Charges Mr. Sarvari was charged with
    first-degree murder, which took place in 1984. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Sarvari’s defense. Judgment Branch 1 of the Penal Court
    of Bandar Anzali sentenced Mr. Sarvari to death and the Supreme Judicial
    Council approved the sentence. Mr. Yusef Sarvari was executed in public at
    Khomeini Square in Bandar Anzali. He was 19 years old.
