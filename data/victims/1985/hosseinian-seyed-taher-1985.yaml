    The execution of Mr. Seyed Taher Hosseinian, along with 21 others, was
    reported in the Kayhan Daily on April 28, 1985. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Hosseinian was charged with “organizing and membership in a
    drug-trafficking gang as well as being involved in supplying and
    distributing drugs (approximately 90 kg of opium repeatedly).” Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Hosseinian’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Zahedan sentenced Mr. Hosseinian to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out in
    the Islamic Penitentiary of Zahedan’s Police Headquarters at 22:40.
