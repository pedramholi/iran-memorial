    The execution of Mr. Ruhollah Azmudeh was reported in the Kayhan newspaper
    on December 9, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr.
    Azmudeh was charged with first-degree murder. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Azmudeh’s defense. Judgment Branch 14 of the Penal Court
    of Shiraz sentenced Mr. Ruhollah Azmudeh to death. The Supreme Court
    approved this verdict. Mr. Azmudeh was executed in the morning of December
    8, 1985 at Adelabad prison in Shiraz in the presence of the victim’s
    relatives. Ruhollah was 20 years old.
