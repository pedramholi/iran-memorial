    The execution of Mr. Abbas Mottajeri, son of Asghar, known as Asghar and
    Jamshid, along with 24 others, was reported in the Kayhan daily on January
    28, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on

    tribunals of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs
    in Tehran. Charges According to this report, Mr. Mottajeri and three other
    defendants were collectively charged with “being highly active in
    supplying and distributing heroin, dealing 13.5 kg of heroin.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the report, Mr. Mottajeri has had
    “10 convictions for supplying and distributing narcotics.” Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Mottajeri’s defense. Judgment One of the
    tribunals of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs
    in Tehran sentenced Mr. Mottajeri to death and the Supreme Court approved
    the verdict. Mr. Abbas Mottajeri and 24 other individuals were hanged at
    Qasr prison in Tehran on January 28, 1985.
