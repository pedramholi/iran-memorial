    The execution of Mr. Ali Bigdeli was reported in the Kayhan daily on
    February 19, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known but the report mentions
    that Mr. Bigedeli spent 14 years in prison. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial but according to the report his trial
    started in 1970 under the supervision of the former regime’s court.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Bigdeli was charged with
    first-degree murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Bigdeli’s defense. Judgment According to the newspaper, “six of the
    victim’s next of kin (avengers of blood) decided to accept his blood money
    and forego the penalty of retribution (death). However the victim’s wife
    and daughter request the court to condemn him to capital punishment.” The
    court sentenced Mr. Bigdeli to death and the Supreme Judicial Council
    approved the verdict. Mr. Ali Bigdeli was hanged at Qasr prison on
    February 18, 1985 in the presence of some prison authorities.
