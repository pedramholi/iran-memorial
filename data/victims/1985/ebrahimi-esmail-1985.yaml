    The execution of Lieutenant Colonel Esma’il Ebrahimi, along with two
    others, was reported in the Kayhan daily on January 3, 1985. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Lieutenant Colonel Ebrahimi was charged
    with “repeated banditry, armed robbery, and threatening people on the way
    between Khoram Abad and Qom.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    Lieutenant Colonel Ebrahimi’s defense. Judgment The 1st division of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Qom sentenced Lieutenant Colonel
    Ebrahimi to death. After being confirmed, the sentence was carried out in
    the Islamic Revolution’s Public Prosecutor’s Office. According to this
    report, the sentence was issued based on article 198 of the law of Hodud
    and Qesas (the law of talio and physical punishment) as well as article 11
    of the Islamic Punishment Law.
