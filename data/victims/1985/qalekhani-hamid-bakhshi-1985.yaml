    The execution of Mr. Hamid Bakhshi Qal’ekhani, son of Ahmad, along with 12
    others, was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on October 22, 1985. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Bakhshi Qal’ekhani and two other
    men, including his brother Mehdi, were collectively charged with
    “establishing a crime ring to smuggle heroin.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution mentions that Mr. Bakhshi Qal’ekhani had a “criminal record.”
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Bakhshi Qal’ekhani’s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman declared Mr. Bakhshi
    Qal’ekhani a “corruptor on earth” and sentenced him to death. The Islamic
    Revolution’s Supreme Court confirmed the sentenced. He, his brother Mehdi,
    and 11 other individuals were hanged in the prison of the Police
    Department of Kerman on October 22, 1985.
