    The execution of Mr. Ramezan Sadati, son of Shokrollah, was reported in
    the Kayhan daily on September 14, 1985. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr.
    Sadati was charged with first-degree murder. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Sadati’s defense. Judgment The Penal Court of Amol
    (Mazandaran province) sentenced Mr. Ramezan Sadati to death. The Supreme
    Judicial Council approved the sentence. He was hanged at the public
    parking of the City Hall of Amol in the presence of more than 4 thousand
    bystanders. He was 20 years old.
