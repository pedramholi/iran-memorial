    The execution of Mr. Mostafa Javanmardi, along with ten others, was
    reported in the Kayhan Daily on April 23, 1985. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report,

    distributing heroin, transporting heroin before being arrested as well as
    being convicted of supplying and distributing heroin seven times- three
    times before the revolution and four times after it.” Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on this unnamed defendant’s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Javanmardi to death. The
