    The executions of Mr. Khavar Gudarzi and another individual were reported
    in the Kayhan Daily on April 29, 1985. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Gudarzi was charged with fighting against
    the Muslim Ummah through being actively involved in a drug gang in Mashad
    and its suburb as well as Tehran, possessing and distributing 2.5 kg of
    heroin and collaboration in supplying 5.5 kg of heroin and opium. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Gudarzi s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Mashad sentenced Mr. Gudarzi to death. After the Islamic
    Revolution's Supreme Court confirmed the sentence, it was carried out. .
