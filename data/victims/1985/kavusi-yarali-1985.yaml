    The execution of Mr. Yar’ali Kavusi was reported in the Kayhan daily on
    April 8, 1985. Arrest and detention Mr. Kavusi was arrested by the police
    officers 24 hours after committing the crime on February 19, 1984. There
    is no further information regarding the circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. Charges Mr. Kavusi was charged with first-degree murder and
    robbery. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Kavusi’s
    defense. Judgment Mr. Kavusi was sentenced to death. He was executed in
    Gotvand (Khuzestan province) in the presence of the victim’s relatives in
    the afternoon of April 10, 1985.
