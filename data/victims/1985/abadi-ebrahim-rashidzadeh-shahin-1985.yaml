    The execution of Mr. Ebrahim Rashidzadeh Shahin Abadi, son of Nikala,
    along with 24 others, was reported in the Kayhan daily on January 28,
    1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial, other than Mr. Rashidzadeh Shahin Abadi was tried at
    one of the tribunals of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office to
    Combat Drugs in Tehran. Charges According to this report, Mr. Rashidzadeh
    Shahin Abadi and two other defendants were collectively charged with
    “being highly and continuously active in supplying and distributing
    heroin, transporting 7.5 kg of heroin from Orumieh to Tehran and selling
    it at two different times, storing 1.450 kg of heroin at Ebrahim’s house
    and storing more than 9 kg of heroin at home.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the report, Mr. Rashidzadeh Shahin Abadi has had “a criminal
    record for supplying and distributing heroin.” Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Rashidzadeh Shahin Abadi’s defense. Judgment One of the
    tribunals of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs
    in Tehran sentenced Mr. Rashidzadeh Shahin Abadi to death and the Supreme
    Court approved the verdict. Mr. Ebrahim Rashidzadeh Shahin Abadi and 24
    other individuals were hanged at Qasr prison in Tehran on January 28,
    1985.
