    The execution of Mr. Hasan Sepahvand, along with two others, was reported
    in the Kayhan daily on January 3, 1985. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Sepahvand was charged with “repeated
    banditry, armed robbery, and threatening people on the way between Khoram
    Abad and Qom.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Sepahvand’s defense. Judgment The 1st division of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Qom sentenced Mr. Sepahvand to death. After
    being confirmed, the sentence was carried out in the Islamic Revolution’s
    Public Prosecutor’s Office. According to this report, the sentence was
    issued based on article 198 of the law of Hodud and Qesas (the law of
    talio and physical punishment) as well as article 11 of the Islamic
    Punishment Law.
