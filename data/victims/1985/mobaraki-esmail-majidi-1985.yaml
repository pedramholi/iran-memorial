    The execution of Mr. Esmaeel Majidi Mobaraki was announced by the public
    relations office of the Islamic Revolution s Committee of Gilan and
    reported in the Kayhan Daily on June 25, 1985. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Majidi Mobaraki was charged with being
    involved in drug business, distributing and dealing opium, persuading
    prisoners to distribute heroin in prison, addicting other prisoners to
    narcotics and corrupting the society. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Majidi
    Mobaraki s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Rasht
    declared Mr. Majidi Mobaraki a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to
    death. Having been confirmed by the Islamic Revolution s Supreme Court,
    the sentence was carried out in public.
