    The information about Mr. Morteza Gazorani is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism by Rah-e Kargar Publications. He was
    born in Arak and a student at Tehran University majoring in Science. After
    the revolution, he joined the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran,
    Rah-e Kargar. He helped the organization by selling its publications and
    providing financial support. After June 20, 1981, he was transferred to
    Tehran and continued his political activities in working class areas.
    "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was
    established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They identified themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. The demonstration of June 20, 1981, took place in protest
    against the parliament's impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic
    Republic's systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) from participating in politics, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to
    meet with MKO leaders and his insistence that they disarm. Until that day,
    the MKO had supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to
    function within the framework of the new political system. On June 20, the
    Organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations all over the country. These
    demonstrations, which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing
    of dozens of demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and
    executions by the Revolutionary Guards and other para-military forces that
    targeted all opposition groups. The massive repression, unprecedented in
    the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized the months-old state
    harassment and suppression of dissidents and resulted in the banning of
    all forms of independent political dissent. Arrest and detention The
    details of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown. According to
    the above book, Mr. Morteza Gazorani was arrested in 1985 and transferred
