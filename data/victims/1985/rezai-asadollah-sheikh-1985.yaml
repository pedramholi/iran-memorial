    The execution of Mr. Asadollah Sarlak, along with ten others, was reported
    in the Kayhan Daily on April 21, 1985. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Sarlak was charged with “being actively and consistently involved in

    three times, dealing 6 kg of heroin two times, selling 50 and 100-gram
    packages of heroin, dealing 12.600 kg of heroin over a period of time and
    distributing it in northern Tehran and selling 1 kg of heroin.” Evidence
    of guilt The report of this execution does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Sarlak’s defense. Judgment The
