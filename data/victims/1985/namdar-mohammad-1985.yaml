    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Namdar was reported in the Kayhan daily on
    March 1, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Namdar was
    charged with first-degree murder. The murder allegedly occurred during a
    quarrel between the defendant and another man about 11 month earlier,
    during which Mr. Namdar stabbed the victim. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the report, Mr. Namdar had been previously convicted several
    times of resorting to the knife. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Namdar’s defense. Judgment Qom’s Penal Court sentenced Mr. Namdar to
    death. The sentence was carried out in prison at dawn.
