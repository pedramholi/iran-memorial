    The execution of Mr. Qodratollah Dara’i, along with 14 others, was
    announced in a communiqué by the Intelligence Office of Mazandaran. The
    communiqué was published in the Kayhan daily on March 11, 1985. The
    communiqué is as follows: “In the Name of God Due to the favors of God and
    the wise advice of our respectful Imam about ending the Forest commotion,
    as well as the continuous efforts and sacrifices of the Islamic
    Revolution’s Revolutionary Guards, the hellish spidery organization of the
    hypocrites was destroyed in the verdant forests of Mazandaran. And all the
    partisans of estekbar (arrogance) were seized by the wrath of the avenging
    and omnipotent God. Away from their fugitive leaders, the traitors abroad,
    and their treacherous clamor, all the members were captured by the valiant
    men of Islam.” This execution was also reported in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges The communiqué does not specify the charges
    against Mr. Dara’i. All 14 defendants are collectively charged with:
    “membership in the hypocrites organization (term used for the Mujahedin-e
    Khalq Organization by the Islamic Republic authorities), martyring an
    unarmed shepherd who refused to collaborate with them with a knife and
    poniard - not shooting him in order not to waste a bullet-, martyring 6
    members of Basij (Mobilization Forces) of Qaemshahr cruelly while they
    were asleep, as well as committing tens of crimes resulting in 21 martyrs
    and 23 wounded.” Evidence of guilt There is no evidence presented in the
    communiqué that specifically incriminates Mr. Dara’i. According to the
    communiqué all the defendants were implicated through both their
    confessions during the trial in front of the families of those killed, and
    weapons found during search and seizure by the revolutionary guards. The
    report explains: “upon searching the shelters of the defendants, the
    revolutionary guards found: “tens of war weapons, military grenades,
    cyanide, ‘se rahi’ (kind of explosive), walkie-talkies, and two military
    compasses, in addition to, many cartridges.” There is no mention of the
    specifics of these confessions. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Dara’i’s defense. Judgment Mr. Dara’i was sentenced to death. There is no
    information about the tribunal which issued the death sentence. Having
    been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried
    out at dawn.
