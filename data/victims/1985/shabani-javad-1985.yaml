    The execution of Mr. Javad Sha’bani was reported in the Kayhan newspaper
    on January 12, 1985. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial, other than he was tried at the Penal
    Court of Malayer (Hamedan province). Charges According to this report, Mr.
    Sha’bani was charged with murder. He had stabbed the murdered man during a
    fight. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Sha’bani’s defense. Judgment The Penal
    Court of Malayer sentenced Mr. Javad Sha’bani to death. The Supreme Court
    approved the sentence. He was hanged in prison in Malayer in the presence
    of the judiciary officials and the police.
