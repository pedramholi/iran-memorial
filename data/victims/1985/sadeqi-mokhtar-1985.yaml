    The execution of Mr. Mokhtar Sadeqi, son of Qasem, along with 12 others,
    was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on October 22, 1985. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Sadeqi was charged with “buying,
    seeling, and distributing 4700 kg of opium since the last time he was
    arrested.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution mentions that Mr.
    Sadeqi had a criminal record. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Sadeqi’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman
    declared Mr. Sadeqi a “corruptor on earth” and sentenced him to death. The
    Islamic Revolution’s Supreme Court confirmed the sentenced. He and 12
    other individuals were hanged in the prison of the Police Department of
    Kerman on October 22, 1985.
