    The information about Mr. Ahmad Reza Sho'a'i Na'ini is based on an
    interview with a person close to him. Mr. Ahmadreza Sho'a'i Na'ini was a
    member of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. During the previous regime, in
    1971, he was arrested and condemned to 11 years imprisonment when he was a
    student in the Technical School of Tehran University. Having spent 7 years
    in Tehran and Mashhad prisons, he was released from prison. According to
    the interviewee, during his detention period in Mashhad, he converted
    three religious students ( talabeh ) to atheist ideology. This caused the
    enmity of some religious figures that became influential after the
    Revolution when he was a prisoner in the Islamic Republic. The Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban
    Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded
    in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. In 1981,
    the organization, which had opted for open political and electoral
    activity after the revolution, split over the critique of the concept of
    urban guerilla warfare and the support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic,
    and though it did not abandon the theory of armed struggle, its activities
    were mainly limited to the political arena and the labor movement.
    Following the Mojahedin Khalq Organization s June 21st declaration of
    armed struggle, the Fadaiyan announced the organization of combatant
    cells. However, based on available information, these cells did not become
    operational. Many of the groups members and supporters were arrested and
    executed in the early 1980 s. Arrest and detention Mr. Ahmad Reza Sho'a'i
    Na'ini was arrested at a disclosed meeting in Shahr-e Ara in Tehran on
    December 31, 1983. He was detained at Evin prison, Koshu'i school (hall 6,
    room 90). According to his relatives, his kidneys failed after several
    days of torture. Consequently, he was taken to the prison hospital for
    dialysis. A nurse that knew him in the hospital relayed a message to his
    wife asking her to leave the country as soon as possible. Mr. Sho'a'i
    Na'ini was denied the right to have an attorney. His first visitation with
    his family took place a year after his arrest. In his last visitation, he
    showed his family members the marks of tortures on his feet and told them
    that they broke his hands too. During the same visitation, he asked them
    if they requested for a face-to-face visitation and since their reply was
    negative, he told them that he would be executed. (Visitations generally
    took place from behind a glass divider and through a telephone.
    Face-to-face interviews were rare, and, if without prior request, they
    could indicate that the prisoner was to be executed.) Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges No information is available
    on Mr. Ahmad Reza Sho'a'i Na'ini's charges. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available about his defense. Judgment Mr. Ahmadreza Sho'a'i Na'ini was
    executed at Evin prison on September 19, 1985. According to his cellmates,
    he was executed by firing squad. According to his relatives, his body was
    not returned to his family.
