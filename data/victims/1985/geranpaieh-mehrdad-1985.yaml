    Information about Mr. Mehrdad Geranpayeh is based on two electronic forms
    sent to Omid by a person familiar with his case. In these forms, memories
    of his friends are quoted, based on an article published on the website of
    Akhbar-rooz on September 3, 2011. His name is also listed among the
    victims of the Fadaiyan Khalq Minority Organization. According to the
    existing information, Mr. Geranpayeh was born into a large family in
    Hamadan, in 1960. He was single, a senior student in high school, and a
    sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Minority. According to his friends, he
    was athletic and loved climbing the high mountains of Iran. He was a kind,
    funny, and happy individual who always tried to inspire those around him.
    The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist-Leninist group inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. In
    1981, the organization, which had opted for open political and electoral
    activity after the revolution, split over a critique of the concept of
    urban guerilla warfare and the support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic,
    and though it did not abandon the theory of armed struggle, its activities
    were mainly limited to the political arena and the labor movement.
    Following the Mojahedin Khalq Organization s June 21st declaration of
    armed struggle, the Fadaiyan announced the organization of combatant
    cells. However, based on available information, these cells did not become
    operational. Many of the groups members and supporters were arrested and
    executed in the early 1980 s. Arrest and detention According to one
    electronic form, he was arrested in Hamadan in 1984, after two years
    living in hiding and without any connection to his organization. However,
    according to a report published on the Akhbar-e rooz website, which quoted
    a comrade after his organization was recognized in Hamadan in 1982, Mr.
    Geranpayeh first moved to Tehran, and then to Esfahan, where his sister
    lived. He was identified and arrested in Esfahan. Agents of the
    Intelligence Ministry of Hamadan interrogated him in Esfahan and then
    transferred him to Hamadan. According to this report, he was tortured
    severely, and, while receiving lashes, a piece of wood was forced into his
    throat to suppress his cries. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Mehrdad Geranpayeh s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr.
    Mehrdad Geranpayeh s charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Mehrdad Geranpayeh. Defense No information is available about Mr. Mehrdad
    Geranpayeh s defense. Judgment According to the information sent to Omid ,
    Mr. Mehrdad Geranpayeh was executed or killed at the Hamedan prison on
    September 15, 1985. When his family took some clothes for him, hoping to
    visit him, authorities showed them his body. Later, Mr. Geranpayeh s
    mother told one of his friends, We could not believe it. We thought he was
    not feeling well, lying down. We called him and went closer. It was
    unbelievable. The boy was gone.
