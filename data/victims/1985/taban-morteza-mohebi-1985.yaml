    News of the execution and information about Mr. Morteza Mohebi Taban, son
    of Abolfazl, was based on three interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation with a person close to him, a political prisoner who
    had been his cellmate for two years, and Ms. Vida Hajebi, who had been a
    member of the Central Committee of the Fadaiyan Khalq Majority Left
    Faction along with Mr. Taban before his arrest. Mr. Mohebi Taban was born
    in Tehran in 1953. He was the fifth child in his family and liked to read
    books since childhood. Before the revolution, during his high school
    years, he was a member of the Institute for the Intellectual Development
    of Children and Young Adults and won a scientific prize including a
    helicopter flight over Tehran. He worked during the summers to provide for
    his education and participated in supporting his family since adolescence.
    When he entered the Melli University, he gradually began his political
    activism by sympathizing with the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. After the
    revolution, when the organization divided into three factions, he joined
    the Left Faction and became a member of the three-member Executive Board
    of the organization. Two other members were Vida Hajebi and Morteza
    Karimi, the latter of whom was executed in April of 1983. Mr. Mohebi Taban
    was a hardworking, patient, and kind human being who always cared about
    others. Two of his relatives were also executed including his cousin,
    Siamak Qorbani, in September of 1981 and his brother-in-law, Amir Azanpur,
    in October of 1984. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist
    group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements
    of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to
    the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the Organization, which
    had renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic
    Republic and of theSoviet Union. A month after this split, other splits
    occurred. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority Left Faction was the first group to
    split over opposition to the Majority tendency to cooperate with the
    Islamic regime and its proximity to the Tudeh party. This group ended its
    activities after several years of publishing its views inside and outside
    of Iran. Arrest and detention Mr. Mohebi Taban was incidentally arrested
    on a street in Tehran after a demonstration by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on November 24, 1981. For some time his political affiliation
    remained unnoticed in prison; however, his political position was revealed
    by a prisoner. His family were able to visit him after being in the dark
    for a few months. He had an in-person visitation with a relative in the
    presence of Revolutionary Guards in prison in 1984. According to his
    cellmate, Mr. Mohebi Taban had been tortured so severely that for a period
    they took him to the prison clinic for a pain killer shot every morning.
    After a panel sent by Ayatollah Montazeri visited the prison, Mr. Mohebi
    Taban had complained about pains caused by torture and daily pain killers
    were ordered for him. According to his cellmate, marks of tortures were
    evident on his soles and feet. He was well-known in prison as the person
    who suffered the most torture and yet revealed no information. He had been
    taken for execution several times. At least three such occasions stand
    out, since Mr. Mohebi Taban gave mementos to various people each time.
    Once, he gave his watch, the second time his shirt, and the third time his
    socks to his cellmates before going for execution. According to Ms. Vida
    Hajebi, Mr. Mohebi Taban was against using cyanide before his arrest,
    arguing that one must resist and that the prison is a scene for struggle.
    According to Ms. Hajebi, he showed his resistance in action. He had
    widespread connections and knew of several safe houses but revealed
    nothing to his interrogators despite the severe torture he suffered.
    According to his cellmate, Mr. Mohebi Taban was a creative person. He
    created art works using cast-off and rudimentary materials in prison. He
    had a good relationship with all political prisoners with different
    affiliations. He was a mountain climber and knew of his imminent
    execution; therefore, he told a friend who was about to be released that:
    Whenever you reach a mountain peak, remember me by calling my name. Trial
    According to people close to Mr. Mohebi Taban, he had been tried several
    times. However, no information is available on his trials. Charges No
