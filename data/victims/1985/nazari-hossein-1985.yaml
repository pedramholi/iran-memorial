    The execution of Mr. Hossein Nazari, former police officer in Rasht, was
    reported in the Kayhan newspaper on October 9, 1985. Two women, named
    Nosrat and Khadijeh, were accused of having relations with Mr. Nazari and
    executed. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Nazari was
    charged with “committing 20 counts of adultery and having contacts with
    the group-lets, which are at war with God.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the report, the defendant “was arrested while committing
    adultery and confessed to all charges at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Rasht.” International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Nazari’s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Rasht sentenced Mr. Amrollah Nazari to death.
    The Supreme Judicial Council approved the verdict. Mr. Nazari was shot by
    a firing squad at the garrison of Basij forces in Rasht in the evening of
    October 8, 1985.
