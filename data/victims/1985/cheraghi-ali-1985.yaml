    Mr. Ali Cheraghi is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Further information was sent to Omid via an electronic form by a
    person familiar with the case. Mr. Cheraghi, born and residing in Takab,
    was a teacher. He was also a member of the Fadayian Khalq Organization
    (minority). The Fadayian Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin
    America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadayian Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic
    Republic and was mainly active in the political arena and the labor
    movement. There is a discrepancy between the two sources regarding the
    method used in Mr. Cheraghi s execution. Arrest and detention The details
    of this defendant s detention are not known. According to the form, Mr.
    Cheraghi was arrested on July 1, 1985 at around 4 p.m. at the Khomeini
    Avenue in Takab. He was held at the Takab Committee s Intelligence Office.
    He reportedly died under torture. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges The charges against the defendant are unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Cheraghi's defense. Judgment No
    specific information regarding the death sentence is available.
