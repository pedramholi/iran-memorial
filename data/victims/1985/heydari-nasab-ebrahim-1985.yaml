    The execution of Mr. Ebrahim Heydari-Nasab, son of Cherag’ali, along with
    12 others, was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on October 22, 1985.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Heydari-Nasab was
    charged with “buying and selling 910 kg of opium.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution mentions that Mr. Heydari-Nasab had a criminal record. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Heydari-Nasab’s defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman declared Mr. Heydari-Nasab a
    “corruptor on earth” and sentenced him to death. The Islamic Revolution’s
    Supreme Court confirmed the sentenced. He and 12 other individuals,
    including his sister Khorshid, were hanged in the prison of the Police
    Department of Kerman on October 22, 1985.
