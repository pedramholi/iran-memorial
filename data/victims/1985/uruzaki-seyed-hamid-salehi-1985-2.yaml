    was smart and creative, also interested in handicrafts particularly
    woodwork and his country's political events Information about the
    disappearance of Mr. Seyed Hamid Salehi Uruzaki, is taken from an
    interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with a relative
    (ABC interview) and an electronic form sent to Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center. (E-form) Mr. Hamid Salehi Uruzaki, son of Seyed Amanollah, was
    bornin Masjed Soleiman. His father was an employee of the Steel Company in
    Ahvaz. Mr. Salehi was single and had a high school diploma. He was smart,
    creative, and adventerous. He liked handicrafts and was particularly
    interested in woodwork. He had a lathe at home and made several beautiful
    wooden home decorations. (ABC interview) He satrted his political
    activities wth the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1979. According to the
    interviewee, Mr. Salehi was active in the MKO's armed struggle in the
    begininng of 1960s; however, there is no exact information of the nature
    of his activities. Between 1981 and 1985, Mr. Salehi's family was
    scattered into different cities of Khuzestan and Tehran provinces due to
    the Iran -Iraq war and the dangers they may have faced of his political
    activities. Mr. Salehi was living in a safe house and in hiding during
    1983. His family were remotely aware of his activities for a short period,
    but they had no more news of him since a year before his arrest. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention Mr. Salehi's family were told that he was
    arrested during a plotted accident in Kerman in 1983. He was then
    transferred to Ahvaz. Since the family was informed of his arrest in 1983,
    his mother referred to official authorities including the Prosecutor's
    Office in Ahvaz to follow up on his case. She also approached influencial
    civilians whom she knew might have had some connections to the state
    authorities, in order to collect some information about her son. None of
    the efforts had any result. According to the interviewee, Mr. Salehi's
    family believe that he was at least in prison in 1984 and 1985. There are
    no further details available on Mr. Salehi's arrest and detention. Trial
    There is no infomration available on Mr. Salehi's trial. Charges The
    charges brought against Mr. Salehi are not known. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Salehi. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Salehi's defense. Judgment According to the interview, Mr. Salehi
    disappeared either in 1984 or 1985 and his family did not find any
    evidence of him. The execution or killing of Mr. Salehi was never
    announced by official sources and the family stopped following up on his
    case out of fear of being pursued or pressured. Until her passing in 2017,
    his mother was still hopeful that her son was alive and would one day go
    home. There was no sign of Mr. Salehi anywhere out of the prison, either.
    _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO suppo
