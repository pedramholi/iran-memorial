circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Gholam Reza Ragh, along with 6 others, was announced
    in a communiqué of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution’s Office of
    Kerman and reported in the Kayhan newspaper on May 21, 1985. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial Mr. Ragh was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    of Kerman. No other information is available on the trial. Charges
    According to the report, Mr. Ragh was charged with “having connections
    with armed smugglers, as well as dealing and distributing 275 kg of
    opium.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Ragh’s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman sentenced Mr. Ragh to death. The Islamic
    Revolutionary Supreme Court approved the sentence. He and ten other men
    were hanged on May 21, 1985 at prison of the Police Department of Kerman.
