    The execution of Mr. Mehdi E’temadi, son of Mohammad, along with 24
    others, was reported in the Kayhan daily on January 28, 1985. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial,
    other than Mr. E’temadi was tried at one of the tribunals of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs in Tehran. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. E’temadi and two other defendants were
    collectively charged with “being greatly and continuously active in
    supplying and distributing heroin… collaboration in supplying 7 kg of
    heroin in Orumieh and selling it in Tehran, supplying 1 kg of heroin and
    selling it in 5-gram packages”. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the
    report, Mr. E’temadi had “18 previous convictions for supplying and
    distributing narcotics and possession of 2.98 kg of heroin at the time of
    his arrest.” Defense No information is available on Mr. E’temadi’s
    defense. Judgment One of the tribunals of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecution Office to Combat Drugs in Tehran sentenced Mr. E’temadi to
    death and the Supreme Court approved the verdict. Mr. Mehdi E’temadi and
    24 other individuals were hanged at Qasr prison in Tehran on January 28,
    1985.
