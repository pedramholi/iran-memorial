    The execution of Mr. Ja far Sohrabpur was reported in the Kayhan Daily on

    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Sohrabpur was
    charged with being involved in distributing narcotics, transporting 46
    packages of heroin and spreading corruption on earth. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Sohrabpur s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Rasht
    declared Mr. Sohrabpur a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death.
    Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out
    by the Revolutionary Guards of the Islamic Revolution s Committee in
    public.
