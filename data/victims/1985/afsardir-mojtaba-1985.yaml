    The execution of Mr. Mojtaba Afsardir, along with 14 others, was announced
    in a statement by the Intelligence Office of Mazandaran. The communiqué
    was published in the Kayhan daily on March 11, 1985. Additional
    information has been provided (sent to Omid through electronic forms) by
    individuals familiar with this case. According to the available
    information, Mr. Afsardir was born in Abadan in 1958. He was a student at
    Babolsar University (Mazandaran province), and a member of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. The statement of the Intelligence Office of Mazandaran
    reads: “In the Name of God “Due to the favors of God and the wise advice
    of our respectful Imam about ending the Forest commotion, as well as the
    continuous efforts and sacrifices of the Islamic Revolution’s
    Revolutionary Guards, the hellish spidery organization of the hypocrites
    was destroyed in the verdant forests of Mazandaran. And all the partisans
    of arrogance were seized by the wrath of the avenging and omnipotent God.
    Away from their fugitive leaders, the traitors abroad, and their
    treacherous clamor, all the members were captured by the valiant men of
    Islam...” Arrest and detention According to the received electronic forms,
    Mr. Afsardir probably was arrested in 1983 or 84. A few months before his
    execution, he had occasional visits with his family at the Revolutionary
    Guards station in Sari. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The statement of Intelligence Office of
    Mazandaran does not specify the charges against Mr. Afsardir. All 14
    defendants are collectively charged with: “membership in the hypocrites
    organization (term used for the Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization by the
    Islamic Republic authorities), martyring an unarmed shepherd who refused
    to collaborate with them with a knife and poniard - not shooting him in
    order not to waste a bullet-, martyring 6 members of Basij (Mobilization
    Forces) of Qaemshahr cruelly while they were asleep, as well as committing
    tens of crimes resulting in 21 martyrs and 23 wounded.” Evidence of guilt
    There is no evidence presented in the communiqué that specifically

    were implicated through both their confessions during the trial in front
    of the families of those killed, and weapons found during search and
