    The execution of Mr. Abbas Safi, son of Ali, along with 10 others, was
    reported in the Kayhan newspaper on May 21, 1985. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Mr. Safi was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman.
    No other information is available on the trial. Charges According to the
    report, Mr. Safi was charged with “direct participation in an armed
    robbery, stealing 7 million tomans cash from the National Bank in Kerman,
    selling stolen goods, and collaborating with the smuggling gang of the
    Molla-Hosseinzadeh brothers.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the
    report, Mr. Safi had a “criminal record.” Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Safi’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Kerman sentenced Mr. Safi to death. The Islamic Revolutionary
    Supreme Court approved the sentence. He and ten other men were hanged on
    May 21, 1985 at prison of the Police Department of Kerman.
