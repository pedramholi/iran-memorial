    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammadmehdi Mohammadi, son of Aliakbar,
    along with three others, was published in the Keyhan newspapers on
    December 23, 1981. The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Masjedsoleiman
    issued an announcement about this execution and released it to the media.
    The Public Relations Department of the Central Revolutionary and Public
    Prosecutor’s Office issued another announcement about the execution of Mr.
    Mohammadmehdi Mohammadi and four others on December 27, 1981. Mr.
    Mohammadmehdi Mohammadi is mentioned along with Mr. Hamid Chehelpolizadeh
    as possible sympathizers of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Minority) in
    the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. According
    to this report, Mr. Mohammadmehdi Mohammadi was executed along with three
    others. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges According to the announcement by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Masjedsoleiman, the charges against Mr.
    Mohammadmehdi Mohammadi were: "Sympathizing with the fighting groups,
    distributing books, publications, and cassettes for them, and organizing
    anti-revolutionaries under the cover of establishing a support fund for
    the relatives of these groups’ members." According to the announcement by
    the Public Relations Department of the Central Revolutionary and Public
    Prosecutor’s Office, his charges were "effective activity against the
    Islamic Republic regime, weakening the regime by distribution of communist
    books, publications, and posters, misleading the younger generation by
    organizing anti-revolutionaries under the pretext of creating a support
    fund for those who were purged in the educational field, and establishing
    connections among various individuals in the organization." The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Mohammadmehdi Mohammadi's defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Masjedsoleiman identified Mr.
    Mohammadmehdi Mohammadi as "Mofsed (corruptor on Earth), Baghi (rebel)
    against Imam and the Islamic Regime, and Mortad (apostate)" and condemned
    him to death. The ruling was carried out in Shushtar on December 21, 1981
    at midnight.
