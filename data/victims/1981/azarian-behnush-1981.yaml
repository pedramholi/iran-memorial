    The news of Ms. Behnush Azarian’s execution, and 22 others, comes from the
    Kayhan daily on June 22, 1981 that quotes the Islamic Republic’s Public
    Prosecutor’s Central Office. Furthermore, Ms. Azarian is one of the 1533
    executed prisoners listed by the Association of Iranian Women of Köln
    (Germany). The list published in 1997 is entitled: "A partial list of
    names of women executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran. Moreover, 2
    electronic forms (e-form) and e-mails were sent to Omid by persons
    familiar with her case. According to the available information, Ms.
    Azarian was born in Abadan (Khuzestan province) and resided in Tehran. She
    was a member of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (minority) and was taught
    guerrilla warfare. At the beginning of the 1979 Revolution, her father
    sent to the United States to join her siblings who were students there,
    but she returned to Iran after a few months stating that she could not
    bear to be away from events in Iran. She studied mechanical engineering.
    Ms. Azarian was reportedly 6 months pregnant at the time of her execution
    This execution was also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Ms.
    Azarian, a member of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (minority), a secular
    Marxist-Leninist revolutionary organization opposed to the Islamic
    Republic, was executed one day after the June 20, 1981 demonstration. The
    demonstration of June 20, 1981, took place in protest against the
    parliament's impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic's
    systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) from
    the country's political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet
    with MKO leaders, and his insistence for them to disarm. The MKO, a
    Marxist Islamist revolutionary organization, had until then supported the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function within the
    framework of the new political system. On June 20th, the Organization
    officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the regime by
    organizing mass demonstrations, in which some of the demonstrators were
    armed, all over the country. These protests, which were severely
    suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of demonstrators, were
    followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by the Revolutionary
    Guards and paramilitary forces that targeted not only the MKO, but all
    other opposition groups. The massive repression, unprecedented in the
    history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized as official government policy
    the months-old state harassment and suppression of dissidents and resulted
    in the banning of all forms of independent political dissent. Arrest and
    detention Ms. Azarian was arrested along with several other members of the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (minority), including her boyfriend and one of
    the leaders of the organization, in Tehran in a team house where she
    lived, in the winter of 1980. She was imprisoned at the Evin Prison and
    was not allowed visitation with her family (e-form). While in detention,
    Ms. Azarian was reportedly seen by her family and friends on state
    television, where she was brought to confess and denounce her association
    with the Fedayan Organization. (e-form) International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Trial According to the Kayhan daily report, Ms. Azarian, along with
    7 others, was tried by the Islamic Republic’s Central Court in the
    afternoon of June 21, 1981. The trial concluded the same evening. The
    defendant's family did not get a chance to provide her with an attorney.
    It is mentioned on one of the electronic forms that in a letter Ms.
    Azarian wrote that she and the others were tried, but were not allowed to
    speak during their trials. Charges Ms. Azarian’s charges were announced by
    the Islamic Republic’s Public Prosecutor’s Central Office and published in
    the Kayhan daily. The charges are as follows: “being a corruptor, having a
    lover, and having sexual relations outside of wedlock.” She and her
    fiancée were both accused of the same charges. Also the Prosecutor’s
    communiqué states that they were arrested “in relations with the recent
