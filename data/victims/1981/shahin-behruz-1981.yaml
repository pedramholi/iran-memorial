    News of the execution of Mr. Behruz Shahin, son of Abdollah, along with
    three others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on September 13, 1981.
    The Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor s Office
    announced these executions, the defendants' names and their charges. Mr.
    Behruz Shahin is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list
    of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains
    the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Mr. Behruz Shahin is one of the 12,028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of
    dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Masjedsoleiman, the
    charges against Mr. Behruz Shahin were announced as, activity in a team
    house and the military faction of the American organization of Peykar,
    possession of huge amounts of ammunition and destructive materials such as
    grenades, bullets, bombs, and similar materials in his house, and active
    participation in anti-revolutionary demonstrations resulting in killing
    and injuringof some [people]. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the above
    announcement, Mr. Behruz Shahin had a record of criminal activity. But the
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Behruz Shahin's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Masjedsoleiman identified Mr. Behruz Shahin as
    "Mofsed (corruptor on Earth) and Mohareb (fighter) against God the
    Prophet." He was condemned to death. The ruling was carried out when he
    was executed on September 10, 1981.
