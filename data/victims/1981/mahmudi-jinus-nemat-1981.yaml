    An atmospheric scientist, Ms. Ni mat Mahmudi compiled the nation s
    Geographic Atlas. Serene in all circumstances, she urged younger prisoners
    not to waste their days, and they, in turn, complimented her pink and
    purple jacket. Reference to the execution of Ms. Jinus Ne'mat Mahmudi
    (also spelled "Zhinus Ni'mat-Mahmudi"), the first female meteorologist in
    Iran, and seven other members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the
    Baha is in Iran, was made by the the President of the Central
    Revolutionary Court in an interview published in Kayhan on 30 Day 1360 (20
    January 1982). Ms. Mahmudi is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a
    1999 report published by the Baha i International Community. In addition,
    a report, The Persecution of the Baha i Community of Iran , in The Baha i
    World, Volume XIX, documents the persecutions of the members of the Faith
    in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978.
    More information has been drawn from other volumes of the The Baha i World
    , A Tribute to the Faithful by Mah Mehr Gulistanih, Haqiqat-e-Sadeh by
    Monireh Baradaran, Mrs. Mahmudi s cellmate, The Baha i Question: Iran s
    Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community as well as a
    report of a press conference by the President of the Central Revolutionary
    Court in Kayhan Newspaper Nr. 11488 published on 30 Day 1360 (20 January
    1982) and other reports provided by the Baha i International Community.
    Ms. Mahmudi worked as the Director of the Department of Meteorology of
    Iran. She authored the Geographic Atlas of Iran and taught atmospheric
    science and meteorology at various educational institutions including the
    University of Tehran. In addition to her membership on Local Spiritual
    Assemblies of Narmak and later Gohardasht, Ms. Mahmudi was appointed as
    one of the members of the Auxiliary Board to the Baha i Continental Board
    of Counselors for Asia in 1977. Following the Islamic Revolution, her
    pension was cut in February 1980 and she was officially expelled on 30
    March 1980, following charges related to her religion, and merits during
    her services to the Ministry of Defense and Department of Meteorology. Ms.
    Mahmudi is remembered by her cellmate for her kindness and courage : She
    knew she was going to be killed but she was very serene and kind. She
    advised the young inmates to not waste their time and volunteered to teach
    them physics while she was with them. She had a beautiful pink and purple
    jacket that everyone liked, so she left it for her cellmates to use when
    she was called for execution on the afternoon of her last day. The Baha is
    in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention Ms. Mahmudi was arrested
    on 14 December 1981 (23 Azar 1360) following a meeting of the National
    Assembly. The meeting was hosted at the home of a member of the Baha i
    community. After their meeting came to an end, the guests began to leave
    discreetly in order to not draw attention to their gathering, as was often
    the case during the early days of the revolution. A few minutes after she
    and another guest left, they were arrested by revolutionary guards who had
    surrounded the house. The guards then entered the house to arrest the rest
    of the members of the National Assembly and the hosts. They held Ms.
    Mahmudi and everyone else against the wall, blindfolded them, all the
    while shouting and asking about the ninth member of the Assembly
