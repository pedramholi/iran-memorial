    News of the execution of Ms. Jamileh Khaseri, daughter of Naser, along
    with three others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on
    September 2, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Public
    Prosecutor’s Office issued an announcement by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court in Ahvaz about these executions, the defendants' names, and their
    charges. Ms. Khaseri is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on
    the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. She is
    also among the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on
    September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges According to the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court in Ahvaz, the charges against Ms. Jamileh Khaseri were announced as,
    "active cooperation with the combat organization of Peykar, being the
    contact person for the organization in Khuzestan and Shiraz, and using all
    of her means to support the organization." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Ms. Khaseri's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Ahvaz identified Ms. Khaseri as "an enemy of God and His Prophet
    and a rebel against the Islamic regime." She was condemned to death and
    executed by a firing squad on September 1, 1981 at dawn.
