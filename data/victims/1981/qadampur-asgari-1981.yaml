    News of the execution of Mr. Asgari Qadampur, son of Hossein, a resident
    of Babol and a driver, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on November
    14, 1981. Arrest and detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. This trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Babol. Charges The charges against Mr. Asgari Qadampur were
    announced as, transporting and selling 20 grams of heroin and having a
    previous record of conviction. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Asgari Qadampur's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Babol identified Mr. Asgari Qadampur as Mofsed (corruptor on Earth) and
    condemned him to death. The ruling was carried out in Babol on November
    13, 1981 at 10 a.m.
