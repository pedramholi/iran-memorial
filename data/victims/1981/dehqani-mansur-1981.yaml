    News of the execution of Mr. Mansur Dehqani, son of Heidar, along with
    three others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on September
    2, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Public
    Prosecutor’s Office issued an announcement by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court in Ahvaz about these executions, the defendants’ names, and their
    charges. Mr. Dehqani is one of the 430 “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of
    Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the
    organization, more than 400 of whom have been executed. Additionally, his
    name appears among the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz charged Mr. Dehqani with “active
    cooperation with the anti-people organization of Peykar, which is at war
    with God, being the contact person of the Organization in Khuzestan,
    Kordestan, and Shiraz, and using all of his means to support the
    abovementioned Organization.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mansur Dehqani’s
    defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz identified Mr.
    Mansur Dehqani “at war with God and His Prophet and a rebel against the
    Islamic regime.” He was condemned to death and executed by firing squad in
    Ahvaz on September 1, 1981 at dawn. He was 24.
