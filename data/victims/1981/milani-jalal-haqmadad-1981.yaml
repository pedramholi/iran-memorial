    News of the execution of Mr. Jalal Haqmadad-Milani, son of Ali, along with
    thirty-four others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on September 28,
    1981, quoting a statement by the Public Relations Office of the
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s Office. The defendant s names and
    charges were published in this statement. Additional information is based
    on two electronic forms sent to Omid by two persons familiar with his
    case. This execution was also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985.
    The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. According to the electronic forms, Mr. Jalal Haqmadad-Milani,
    28, was born in Milan, Azarbaijan-e Gharbi. He had a bachelor s degree in
    psychology from Tabriz University. He was single, a teacher, and a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He was an activist during
    the Shah s regime. He liked reading and giving help to poorer people. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention According to the electronic forms, Mr.
    Jalal Haqmadad-Milani was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards on Milan
    Bridge, in Osku, during the Mojahedin demonstration for defending
    President Banisadr, on June 20, 1981, at noon. He was transferred to the
    Revolutionary Guards prison in Osku. He had no access to an attorney and
    no visitation with his family. He was detained with seventeen others in a
    two-by-one-and-a-half meter cell. Officials did not respond to his family
    s letters. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    According to the statement by the Public Relations Office of the
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s Office, the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Tabriz issued the ruling against Mr. Haqmadad-Milani and thirty four
    others. According to an electronic form, Mr. Haqmadad-Milani was tried
    ceremonially at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz on August 23,
    1981. He was first condemned to death, then to life imprisonment. The
    Appeal Court in Tehran reduced his sentence to 15 years imprisonment.
    Charges According to the statement by the Public Relations Office of the
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s Office, the charges against Mr. Jalal
    Haqmadad-Milani and thirty four others were announced as, cooperation and
    connection with the Mojahedin organization; membership in team houses;
    supply and possession of explosives and illegal weapons; participation in
    street demonstrations and clashes; approval of all policies of the
    Mojahedin including armed struggle; planning assassinations and creating
    fear and intimidation among the Muslim people; and conspiracy and uprising
    against the Islamic Republic. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to an electronic
    form, the evidence provided against Mr. Haqmadad-Milani was having
    displayed a placard in sympathy with the Mojahedin Organization and
    testimonies of the regime s agents in Osku and Milan. Defense Mr.
    Haqmadad-Milani had no opportunity to defend himself. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court condemned Mr. Jalal Haqmadad-Milani to death. The
    ruling was carried out on September 25, 1981, and he was executed by
    firing
