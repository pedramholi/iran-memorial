    The information about Mr. Ala'edin (Hamid) Kushali Etrati is taken from
    the website of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). He was born in
    Rasht. He was a well known athlete who played on various soccer teams. He
    was also a MKO sympathizer and a parliamentary candidate for this
    Organization. His wife, Ms. Esmat Shari'ati Maziani, and his brother Mr.
    Kamaloledin Kushali Etrati, also MKO sympathizers, were executed too. This
    execution was also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    12028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    unknown. According to the MKO website, Mr. Kushali Etrati was arrested
    shortly after the demonstrations of June 20, 1981 and spent seven months
    in the Rasht prison. He was reportedly tortured severely and when his body
    was delivered to his family, the marks of torture were alarmingly evident.
    The demonstration of June 20, 1981, were in protest against the
    parliament's impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic's
    systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) from
    the country's political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet
    with MKO leaders and his desire to neutralize them. Until that time, the
    MKO had supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to
    function within the framework of the new political system. On June 20th,
    the MKO officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the regime by
    organizing mass demonstrations throughout the country. These
    demonstrations were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of
    dozens of demonstrators. Afterwards there was a wave of mass arrests and
    executions by the Revolutionary Guards and paramilitary forces that
    targeted not only the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive
    repression was unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, and
    it legitimized the months-old state harassment and suppression of
    dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Trial No information is available about the defendant s
    trial. Charges No information is available on the charges against Mr.
    Kushali Etrati. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
    evidence provided against Mr. Kushali Etrati. Defence No information is
    available about the defendant s defence. Judgment No specific information
    is available about the defendant s execution. According to the MKO
    website, Mr. Kushali Etrati was executed in the forests close to the
    prison on December 28, 1981.
