    Mr. Rahmat s Talebinejad s name, is one of the 12028 individuals listed in
    an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist
    group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements
    of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to
    the Pahlavi regime. After the 1979 Revolution, the organization, which
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) opposed the Islamic
    Republic and was active mainly in the political arena and the labor
    movement. The Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority) supported and considered the
    Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime. After the
    spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Majority) members solely because of their political beliefs. Arrest and
