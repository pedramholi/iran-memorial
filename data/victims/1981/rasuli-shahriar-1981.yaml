    News of the execution of Mr. Shahriyar Rasuli, son of Alidad, along with
    twenty-two others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on November 12,
    1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor’s
    Office announced these executions, the defendants’ names and their
    charges, and released this to the media. News of the execution of Mr.
    Rasuli was also published in the book From an Ebullient Ideal a
    publication of former sympathizers of the Peykar Organization, in August
    of 1985. Mr. Rasuli is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on
    the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar.
    Additionally, Mr. Rasuli’s name is among the 12,028 individuals listed in
    an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Rasuli were announced as, “armed uprising against the
    Islamic Republic, distribution of announcements and publication for the
    Peykar Organization, apostasy, and frequenting the organizational safe
    houses.” These charges were announced for nine sympathizers of Peykar
    collectively. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Rasuli’s defense. Judgment َThe
