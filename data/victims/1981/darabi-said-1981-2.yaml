    The news of the execution of Mr. Sa’id Darabi along with that of 9 others,
    was released by the Public Relations of the General Prosecutor's Office in
    a communiqué published in the Jomhuri Eslami and Kayhan newspapers on
    November 29, 1981. This execution was also reported in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    in 1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Further information about Mr. Darabi was taken from MKO’s
    website. He was born in Borujerd, was a medical student at the Ahvaz
    University and a sympathizer of the MKO. After the demonstration of June
    20, 1981, he went underground. The demonstration of June 20, 1981, was a
    protest against the parliament's impeachment of President Banisadr and the
    Islamic Republic's systematic policy of excluding the MKO from the
    country's political scene, the Ayatollah Khomeini’s refusal to meet with
    MKO leaders and his desire to disarm them. Until that day, the MKO had
    supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function
    within the framework of the new political system. On June 20, 1981, the
    MKO officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the regime by
    organizing mass demonstrations throughout the country. These
    demonstrations, which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing
    of dozens of demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and
    executions by the Revolutionary Guards and paramilitary forces that
    targeted not only the MKO, but all opposition groups. The massive
    repression, unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic,
    legitimized the months-old state harassment and suppression of dissidents
    and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent political dissent.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are unknown. According to the MKO website, Mr. Darabi was
    arrested during a secret meeting in Bandar Mahshahr in 1981. During
    interrogations, he did not disclose his name. The prison officials knew
    him as "Hamed". Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. Charges According to the Public Prosecutor’s communiqué, the
    charges against Mr. Darabi were announced as: “overlooking and
    participating in burning of the cars of religious individuals, associating
    with individuals with the Hypocrits Organization [the regime’s name for
    the MKO] after the Organization’s declaration of armed struggle [against
    the regime], membership in the military section [of MKO], being active
    within team houses, storing arms and explosives, instigating and guiding
    sympathizers [of MKO] to commit terrorist acts” These charges are
    collective and brought against the defendant and three other individuals.
    The prosecution does not mention any specific offense for the defendant.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defence No information is available about
    the defendant’s defence. Judgment According to the newspaper accounts, the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Mahshahr declared Mr. Darabi a “corruptor
    on earth, fighter against God, and an enemy” and sentenced him to death.
    The sentence was carried out on November 26, 1981.
