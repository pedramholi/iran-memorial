    News of the execution of Ms. Behjat Malek Mohammadi, daughter of Ali
    Pasha, along with eighteen others, was published in the Keyhan newspapers
    on August 3, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Revolutionary
    and Public Prosecutor’s Office in Tabriz issued an announcement about
    these executions, the defendants' names and their charges, and released it
    to the press. News of the execution of Ms. Malek Mohammadi was also
    published in the Peykar publication, number 126, on November 9, 1981. She
    is also one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of
    “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. Moreover, her name
    is mentioned among the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Ms. Malek Mohammadi had a bachelor’s degree and was
    active in the Publication Center of the Peykar Organization in Tabriz. The
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by
    a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention According to the Peykar report, Ms. Malek Mohammadi was
    arrested, along with seven comrades, during an attack by the regime's
    agents on the Publication and Distribution Center of the organization in
    Tabriz on July 15, 1981. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor’s
    Office in Tabriz announced the charges against Ms. Malek Mohammadi as,
    "armed uprising against the Islamic Republic of Iran in connection with
    her membership in the Peykar Organization, using the organization's houses
    for all sorts of activities for publication of newspapers, posters, and
    placards for Peykar and Komoleh organizations, misleading innocent and
    ignorant youngsters, and cooperation with anti-Islam and anti-Koran armed
    groups of Komaleh, Fadaiyan Khalq (Ashraf Fraction), and others." These
    collective charges are the same for seven other defendants. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Malek Mohammadi's defense. Judgment
    َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz identified Ms. Malek Mohammadi
    as "an enemy of God and His Prophet, a rebel against the Islamic regime, a
    corruptor on earth, and an apostate." She was condemned to death. She was
    executed by a firing squad in Tabriz prison on July 30, 1981 at 11 p.m.
