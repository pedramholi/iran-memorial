    The information about Mr. Mohammad Javadkalbasi is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism by Rah-e Kargar Publications. Additional
    information is also drawn from an interview with one of his old friends.
    He was born in Esfahan in 1952. He was a husband and a father. An old
    friend of his still remembers his bright smile. Mr. Javadkalbasi was a
    student at the Herati High School in Esfehan. Since adolescence he was
    interested in politics. As a high school student, he would receive and
    read magazines of the Third Iran National Front political party. In 1968
    he organized a student demonstration to protest against the decision of
    the Ministry of Education to raise the minimum grade to pass a class.
    After Mr. Javadkalbasi was admitted to the Tabriz University as a history
    student, he moved to Tabriz. As a student, he was arrested in 1973 (under
    the previous regime) due to relations with a group, which supported the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. While in detention, his ideology leaned
    towards Marxism, a fact that triggered the anger of extremist Muslim
    cellmates. After his dissociation from the Mojahedin Organization and
    release from prison, Mr. Javadkalbasi joined the Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran (Rah-e Kargar), and became a member of the Esfahan
    Committee of the Organization and the head of the Workers’ section in the
    region. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran"
    was established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They identified themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Arrest and detention Mr. Mohammad Javadkalbasi was arrested in
    July 1981 along with three others in the residential house of the head of
    the Organization in Esfehan which served as the Organization’s Esfahan
    Committee headquarters. Reportedly one of the Muslim extremist former
    cellmates had reported him to the authorities. Mr. Javadkalbasi was taken
    to Kashefi Garden for interrogation. He was detained for 33 days during
    which he was tortured. When his body was returned to his family, evidence
    of torture could be easily detected on his body. Trial The entire process
    of arrest, interrogation, and trial took only 33 days. He was deprived of
    the right to be represented by a lawyer. Charges No information is
    available on Mr. Javadkalbasi’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available about his defense. Judgment Mr.
    Mohammad Javadkalbasi was executed by a firing squad in Esfahan on August
    2, 1981.
