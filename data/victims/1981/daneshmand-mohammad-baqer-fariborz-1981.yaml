    Information about Mr. Mohammadbaqer (Fariborz) Daneshmand, son of
    Mohammadesma il, is based on an electronic form sent to Omid by his
    cousin. According to this information, he was born in Rasht in 1964. He
    was sixteen years old and a high school student. Mr. Daneshmand was not
    affiliated with any political group. He was a passionate young man, who
    had been injured during the Revolution, when he was only 14, and a quiver
    was still in his body. His cousin remembers him as an enthusiastic and
    passionate adolescent who became active during the revolutionary days. He
    would perform his daily prayer and fasting [during Ramadan] and comment,
    jokingly, I eat before dawn, based on Farsi radio, and again, based on
    Arabic radio, since the sun sets one hour sooner in those countries. Mr.
    Mohammadbaqer (Fariborz) Daneshmand is one of the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No. 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. International laws have
    strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the
    age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the
    Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offense
    committed before the age of eighteen. According to his cousin, Mr.
    Daneshmand was very sad after his fifteen-year-old friend, Vahid A
    inparast, was executed. They had both gone to watch the demonstration on
    June 20, 1981, when Vahid had been arrested. In a note, found by his
    family after his execution, before going to the streets in October of
    1981, Mr. Daneshmand wrote: I cannot tolerate to see the crying eyes of
    Vahid s mother. I m going and hoping to be killed, too. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Mohammadbaqer (Fariborz) Daneshmand s
    arrest and detention are not known. According to the information sent to
    Omid, he was arrested in a street in Tehran in October of 1981. According
    to his will, Mr. Daneshmand had been shot and injured during a street
    clash. His family was not informed of his arrest. All their efforts to get
    information from officials were futile. Mr. Daneshmand was denied access
    an attorney. Trial No information is available on Mr. Daneshmand s trial.
    Charges No information is available on Mr. Daneshmand s charges. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Daneshmand.
    Defense No information is available about Mr. Daneshmand s defense.
    Judgment No specific information is available about Mr. Daneshmand s
    execution. According to the electronic form, Mr. Mohammadbaqer (Fariborz)
    Daneshmand was executed by firing squad in Tehran, the day after his
    arrest in October of 1981. The family read the news in a newspaper two
    days after his disappearance. They had to pay bullet money in order to
    know his burial place and receive his will.
