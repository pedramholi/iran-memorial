    News of the execution of Mr. Safarali Ranjuri Qayesh Qurshaq, son of Ali,
    and 34 other individuals, was published in Kayhan newspaper on Monday,
    September 28, 1981, quoting the communiqué of the Office of Public
    Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General’s Office. The
    names and crimes of the accused have been stated in this communiqué. Mr.
    Ranjuri Qayesh Qurshaq is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Based on available information, Mr. Ranjuri Qayesh
    Qurshaq was a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted
    the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members’ interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah’s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization’s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances of Ranjuri Qayesh
    Qurshaq’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. According to the communiqué of the
    Office of Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor
    General’s Office, the Tabriz Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal tried Mr.
    Ranjuri Qayesh Qurshaq and 34 other individuals. Charges The Office of
    Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General’s Office
    has stated the charges brought against Mr. Safarali Ranjuri Qayesh Qurshaq
    and 27 others as being “working with and being actively connected to the
    Hypocrites (derogatory terms used by the Islamic Republic to describe the
    MKO) organization, taking part in living in safe houses, procurement and
    possession of prohibited arms and explosive materials, participation in
    street demonstrations and skirmishes, approval and acceptance of
    Hypocrites’ position of adopting armed struggle, devising plans of terror
    and spreading fear and insecurity among the engaged Moslem people [of
    Iran], plotting rising against the Islamic Republic.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Ranjuri Qayesh Qurshaq. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Ranjuri Qayesh Qurshaq’s defense. Judgment
    *The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of
    their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic
    Republic authorities’ different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap
    between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin
    as “Hypocrites” and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
    treatment by governmental officials and the government officials’ efforts
    to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact
    that the regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and
    Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from this
    demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were arrested
    and executed in the following days and weeks. The day after the
    demonstration, the Islamic
