    News of the execution of Mr. Mas'ud Ayazi, son of Mohammadamin, along with
    three others, was published in the Keyhan newspapers on November 3, 1981.
    The Public Relations Department of the Central Revolutionary and Public
    Prosecutor’s Office issued an announcement about this execution and
    released it to the media. Mr. Mas'ud Ayazi is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Mas'ud Ayazi were announced as, "active
    participation in the war in Kordestan and cooperation with Komoleh and
    Democrat parties, direct participation in assassination of Mr. Jamshidi,
    head of the Komiteh in the region, participation in setting up the
    organizational houses in Mahabad, committing terrorist actions resulting
    in the killing of many Revolutionary Guards and army personnel, and
    possession of weapons and ammunition." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mas'ud Ayazi's defense. Judgment The Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Court identified Mr. Mas'ud Ayazi as "Baghi, Mofsed, and
    Mohareb" (Rebel, Corruptor, and Fighter against God and the Prophet) and
    condemned him to death. The ruling was carried out in the Evin prison yard
    in Tehran on November 3, 1981. No details are available about this
    execution.
