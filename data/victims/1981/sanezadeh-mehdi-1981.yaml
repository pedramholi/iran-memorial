    Mr. Mehdi Sane'zadeh is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Additional information has been sent to Omid via an
    electronic form. According to the form, he was affiliated with the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization and a political prisoner under the previous
    regime. The same source states that he was a mechanical engineer, a
    graduate of the Tehran s University of Technology and Science. However,
    the Mojahed magazine states that he was a government employee and a
    university student. He was married and had a child. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The exact
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Mr.Sane'zadeh was arrested on July 27, 1981 at noon in Tehran by the
    Revolutionary Guards. He was, then, transferred to Karaj and denied the
    right to attorney. Trial No information is available on the defendant s
    trial other than it took place in Karaj. Charges No information is
    available on the charges brought against Mr. Sane'zadeh. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Sane'zadeh s defense. Judgment The details of the verdict
    leading to this execution are not known. Mr. Sane'zadeh was executed by a
    firing squad in Karaj on August 6, 1981. _________________________ * The
    exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of their
    centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic
    authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the
    two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites
    and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin
    sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while distributing
    publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20,
    1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by
    governmental officials and the government officials efforts to impeach
    their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the
    regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets,
    some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The
    number of casualties that resulted from this demonstration is unknown but
    a large number of demonstrators were arrested and executed in the
    following days and weeks. The day after the demonstration, the Islamic
    Republic regime started a repressive campaign unprecedented in modern
    Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and sympathizers were arrested
    or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO announced an armed struggle against
    the Islamic Republic and assassinated a number of high-ranking officials
    and supporters of the Islamic regime. In the summer of 1981, the leader of
    the MKO and the impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in
    France, where they founded the National Council of Resistance. After the
    MKO leaders and many of its members were expelled from France, they went
    to Iraq and founded the National Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which
    entered Iranian territory a few times during the
