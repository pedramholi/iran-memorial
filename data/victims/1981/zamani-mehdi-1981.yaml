    The information about Mr. Mehdi Zamani has been drawn from an electronic
    form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. Mr. Zamani is
    also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    Additionally, the executions of Mr. Zamani along with 65 other persons
    were announced in the communiqu of the Public Relations of the Central
    Prosecutor s Office, and published in the Kayhan newspaper on October 4,
    1981. Mr. Zamani was affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Zamani s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial According to the sender of the
    electronic form, Mr. Mohammad Taqi Hadidi, a co-defendant of Mr. Zamani,
    had said that one day they both, along with two other individuals, were
    blindfolded and taken to what, they were told, was their trial. First
    their names were asked and their affiliation with the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Once they all confirmed that they supported the
    Organization, they were asked if they were willing to cooperate in the
    arrest of other supporters of this Organization. They refused. Then the
    verdict was announced: two of them were sentenced to execution (Mehdi
    Zamani and Mahmud Gholami) and the other two to life imprisonment
    (including Mohammad Taqi Hadidi). The exact date of this session is
    unknown. Charges The charges brought against the defendant are not known.
    However, the communiqu of the Public Relations of the Prosecutor s Office
    referred to Mr. Zamani and 29 other individuals as misled elements of the
    group-let of hypocrites (a name used by the authorities of the Islamic
    Republic to refer to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization). It appears that
    Mr. Zamani was charged with affiliation with this Organization. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence
    presented against the accused. Defense No information is available
    concerning Mr. Zamani s defense. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the verdict leading to this execution. Mr. Mehdi Zamani
    was shot by a firing squad on October 3, 1981 in Esfehan, along with 29
    other individuals. _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members
    from government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing
    houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Gu
