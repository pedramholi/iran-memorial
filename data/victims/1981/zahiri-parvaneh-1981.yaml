    She was only a junior at highschool who could have had a bright future
    ahead of her. News of the execution of Ms. Parvaneh Zahiri, daughter of
    Mohammad Hossein, was submitted to the Boroumand Center by a person close
    to her through electronic form. News of this and 21 other executions was
    published in Jomhuri-e Eslami and Kayhan newspapers, quoting the Public
    Relations Office of the Central (Tehran) Islamic Republic Revolutionary
    Prosecutor s Office. (May 22, and 23, 1981). The news was also published
    in Annex Number 261 of the Mojahed magazine (published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization) on September 6, 1985. This Annex includes a list
    comprising the names of 12028 individuals, most of whom were affiliated
    with political groups opposed to the [Islamic Republic] Regime. These
    individuals had either been executed after June 20, 1981, until the time
    of the publication of the Mojahed magazine, or had been killed in fights
    with the Islamic Republic law enforcement forces. Additional information
    about this case was gathered from what people close to her had written on
    the internet. International laws have strictly prohibited capital
    punishment for those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing a crime. As a party to the International Covenant on Civil and
    Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has
    the obligation not to impose capital punishment for an offence committed
    before the age of eighteen. Ms. Zahiri was born in the city of Kermanshah
    and was 17 years old. She was a junior in high school majoring in science,
    and was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted
    the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention Ms. Zahiri
    was arrested by [security] agents in the afternoon of June 20, 1981, under
    the Seyyed Khandan Bridge, while participating in an assembly and
    demonstrations organized by the MKO. She and several other young girls and
    boys were taken to Evin Prison on a bus. They were beaten at the Prison.
    She would not reveal her name during interrogations. Ms. Zahiri spent less
    than a day in detention. The June 20, 1981, demonstrations took place to
    protest the preparations by Majless ( Parliament ) to remove Bani Sadr
    (then President) from office; the denial of competence of MKO candidates
    and preventing them from participation in the country s political affairs;
    Ayatollah Khomeini s opposition to any type of negotiations with the MKO;
    and his insistence on disarming said Organization. The MKO, which, until
    then, had supported Ayatollah Khomeini s leadership and had tried to
    conduct its activities within the framework of the new political regime,
    changed its position and tried to topple the regime and make a power grab
    by initiating widespread demonstrations in which some of its supporters
    were armed. The fierce and brutal quashing of the June 20 demonstrations
    that resulted in the killing of dozens of individuals, and the wave of
    arrests that followed, legitimized, in effect, the attacks of the previous
    months on independent groups and political parties by paramilitary
    militias and the Revolutionary Guards, and by intensifying such crushing
    suppressions in a manner unprecedented in the history of the Islamic
    Republic, turned it into the government s official policy. Trial The
    Central (Tehran) Islamic Revolutionary Court tried Ms. Zahiri. According
    to the Central Islamic Revolutionary Court, the Islamic Court was convened
    to hear the
