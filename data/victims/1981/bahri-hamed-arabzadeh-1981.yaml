    News and information regarding the execution of Mr. Hamed Arabzadeh Bahri,
    son of Hassan, was provided to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center via an
    electronic form by a person close to him on April 10, 2014 (e-form).
    Additional information was obtained from Parvaz facebook page (July 31,
    2015) and E dame-e Langrudis facebook page (December 09, 2013). Mr. Hamed
    Arabzadeh Bahri (Eshkevari) (Mojahedin Khalq Iran ) is also one of the
    12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According to the
    available information, Mr. Arabzadeh Bahri was only 16 years old and
    single. He had finished elementary and middle schools with very good
    grades. At the age of 13, in 1979, he was active in the political
    activities and joined the Mojahedin Khalq Organization after the
    revolution. He was determined and steadfast in reciting the Qoran an and
    performing religious rites (E dam-e Langrudis Dec. 09, 2013) International
    laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment for those who were under
    the age of 18 at the time of committing a crime. As a party to the
    International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on
    the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation not to impose capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention Several agents arrested Mr. Arabzadeh
    Bahri in Langrud [a city in Gilan Province] on July 23, 1981. He spent one
    month and 12 days in Sepah prison of Langrud. His cellmates remember:
    Hamed never missed his religious rites, even with the difficult condition
    of prison and the hot summer weather, he did his fasting and prayers . E
    dam-e Langrudis Dec. 09, 2013) Trial Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Langrud tried Mr. Arabzadeh Bahri. He did not have access to a lawyer nad
    there is no information available on the details of his trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Arabzadeh Bahri was announced as Corruption on
    earth and waging war against God . E dam-e Langrudis Dec. 09, 2013) The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Arabzadeh Bahri.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Arabzadeh Bahri s defense.
    Judgment Islamic Revolutionary Court of Langrud sentenced Mr. Hamed
    Arabzadeh Bahri to death due to corruption on earth and waging war against
    God . Mr. Arabzadeh Bahri was executed with firing squad by Caspian Sea in
    Chamkhaleh [a village in Langrud] on September 03, 1981.
    --------------------------- *The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On
