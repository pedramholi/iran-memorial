    Mr. Mahan Qasempur (Ranjbaran Party of Iran) is one of the 12028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Ranjbaran Party of
    Iran was established, in Tehran, by a number of Marxist groups and parties

    followers of Mao Tse-Tung s school of thought. They opposed the USA and
    the USSR and supported Ruhollah Khomeini as an anti-imperialist leader.
    During the massive repression of 1981, the party was banned and its

    published outside Iran since 1981. Arrest and detention The circumstances
