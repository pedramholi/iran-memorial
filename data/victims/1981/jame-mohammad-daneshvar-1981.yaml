    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Daneshvar Jame’, son of Ahmad, along
    with eighteen others, was published in the Keyhan newspapers on August 3,
    1981. The Public Relations Department of the Revolutionary and Public
    Prosecutor’s Office in Tabriz issued an announcement about these
    executions, the defendants' names, and their charges. He is one of the 430
    individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr. Daneshvar
    Jame’ was active in the publishing section of the Peykar Organization and
    had three children. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the trial other than Mr. Daneshvar
    Jame’ was tried in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz. Charges The
    Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor’s Office in Tabriz announced the
    collective charges against Mr. Daneshvar Jame’ and six other defendants as
    “armed uprising against the Islamic Republic of Iran in connection with
    his membership in the Peykar Organization, using the organization's houses
    for all sorts of activities for publication of newspapers, posters, and
    placards for Peykar and Komaleh organizations, misleading innocent and
    ignorant youngsters, and cooperation with anti-Islam and anti-Koran armed
    groups of Komaleh, Fadaiyan Khalq (Ashraf Fraction), and others.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Daneshvar Jame’s defense. Judgment َThe
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz deemed Mr. Daneshvar to be “at war
    with God, a rebel against the Islamic regime, a corruptor on earth, and an
    apostate.” He was condemned to death and executed by a firing squad in the
    Tabriz prison yard on July 30, 1981 at 11 pm.
