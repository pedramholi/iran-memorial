    News of the execution of Mr. Ya qub Kasbparast, son of Mohammad Hanifeh,
    along with eighteen others, was published in the Keyhan newspaper on
    August 3, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Revolutionary and
    Public Prosecutor s Office in Tabriz issued an announcement about these
    executions, the defendants names, and their charges. He is also is one of
    the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985.
    Moreover, Mr. Kasbparast is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear
    on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. Further
    information was published in the Peykargar (publication of the Peykargar
    Student Union, No. 2, August 10, 1983). Mr. Kasbparast was a candidate for
    the membership of the Peykar Organization and a member of the Publishing
    Committee of this organization in Tabriz. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz tried Mr. Kasbparast. No
    information is available on the trial. Charges The Revolutionary
    Prosecutor s Office in Tabriz announced the charges against Mr. Kasbparast
    as, armed uprising against the Islamic Republic of Iran in connection with
    his membership in the Peykar Organization, using the organization s houses
    for all sorts of activities for publication of newspapers, posters, and
    placards for Peykar and Komoleh organizations, misleading innocent and
    ignorant youngsters, and cooperation with anti-Islam and anti-Koran armed
    groups of Komaleh, Fadaiyan Khalq (Ashraf branch), and others. These
    charges were brought against seven defendants collectively. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Kasbparast s defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz called Mr. Kasbparast at war with
    God and His Prophet, rebel against the Islamic regime, corruptor on earth,
    and apostate. He was condemned to death and executed by a firing squad in
    Tabriz prison on July 30, 1981 at 11 pm.
