circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Esma il Hassanvand, son of Khan Ali, along with six
    others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on July 12, 1981. A
    relative has confirmed his execution via an electronic form sent to Omid.
    Mr. Hassanvand is one of the 430 Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh
    va Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the
    organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the
    individuals on this list have been executed. Moreover, his name appears
    among the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6,
    1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Mr. Hassanvand was a high school student and a sympathizer of
    the Peykar Organization. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a social
    imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention There
    is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr.
    Hassanvand was charged with effective political activity for
    anti-revolutionary goals of the Peykar group-let, conspiracy against the
    Islamic Republic regime and the Muslim nation, participation in recent
    confrontations, and creating fear and intimidation. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Hassanvand was having a record of two
    previous convictions. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Hassanvand s defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Masjed-e Soleyman called Mr. Hassanvand as a corruptor on earth who is at
    war with God and His Prophet, and a rebel against the Imam and the Islamic
    Republic regime. He was condemned to death and executed by firing squad in
    Masjed-e Soleymanon July 11, 1981. He was 16 years old. International laws
    have strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were under
    the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the
    Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of
    the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an
    offence committed before the age of eighteen.
