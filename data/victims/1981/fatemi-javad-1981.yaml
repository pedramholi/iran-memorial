circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Javad Fatemi, son of Ebrahim, along with 4 other
    individuals, was announced in the communiqué of the Revolutionary Public
    Prosecution Office of Tabriz, and published in the Kayhan newspaper on
    June 13, 1981. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial other than he was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tabriz. Charges The charges brought individually against Mr.
    Fatemi are not known. According to the communiqué of the Revolutionary
    Public Prosecution Office, the collective charges brought against him and
    two other individuals were: “moral corruption, establishment of a
    corruption gang, and sodomy with innocent youth… whom they raped.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution only refers to “explicit and repeated
    confessions” regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Fatemi and his
    co-defendants. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on his defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz condemned Mr. Javad Fatemi to death. He
    was executed by a firing squad along with 4 other individuals on June 12,
    1981 at Tarbiz prison.
