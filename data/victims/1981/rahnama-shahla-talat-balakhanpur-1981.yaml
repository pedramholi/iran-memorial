    The information about Ms. Shahla Balakhanpur is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs on the Path to Freedom by Rah-e Kargar Publications. According to
    this book, she introduced herself as Tal'at Rahnama in the prison and was
    executed under that name. She was an obstetric student in Shahreray. After
    the revolution, she was active in the student movement. In early 1981; she
    joined the Rah-e Kargar Organization. Her main responsibilities were to
    sell and distribute the Organization’s publications in the streets. "Rah-e
    Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was
    established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They introduced themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Ms. Shahla Balakhanpur is one of the 12,028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Ms. Shahla Balakhanpur
    (as Tal'at Rahnama) is one of the 1,533 executed prisoners listed by the
    Association of Iranian Women of Köln (Germany). The list, "A Partial List
    of Women Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran” was published on
    September 10, 1997. This list has been updated by former political
    prisoners living throughout the world. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown.
    According to the above book, Ms. Shahla Balakhanpur was arrested in the
    streets of Tehran during the demonstration of June 20, 1981. She was
    detained for less than 24 hours before her execution. The demonstration of
    June 20, 1981, were to protest the parliament's impeachment of President
    Banisadr and the Islamic Republic's systematic policy of excluding the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) from politics, the refusal of Ayatollah
    Khomeini to meet with MKO leaders and his insistence to disarm them. Until
    then, the MKO had supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    agreed to function within the framework of the new political system. On
    June 20th, the Organization officially changed its policy and tried to
    overthrow the regime by organizing mass demonstrations, all over the
    country. These demonstrations, which were severely suppressed and resulted
    in the killing of dozens of demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass
    arrests and executions by the Revolutionary Guards and para-military
    forces that targeted all opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized the
    months-old policy of state harassment and suppression of dissidents which
    resulted in banning of all forms of independent political dissent. Trial
