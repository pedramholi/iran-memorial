    Years after defending their rights and civil standing in 1950 s Yazd,
    attorney Mehdi Amin Amin served fellow Baha is through his election to the
    National Spiritual Assembly. Reference to the execution of Mr. Mehdi (also
    spelled "Mihdi") Amin Amin, a lawyer, and seven other members of the
    National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha is in Iran, was made by the
    President of the Central Revolutionary Court in an interview published in
    Kayhan on 20 January 1982 (30 Day 1360). Mr. Amin Amin is one of the 206
    Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. In addition, a report, The Persecution of the
    Baha i Community of Iran , in The Baha i World, Volume XIX, documents the
    persecutions of the members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran
    and lists the Baha is killed since 1978. More information has been drawn
    from other volumes of the The Baha i World , A Tribute to the Faithful by
    Mah Mehr Gulistanih, The Baha i Question: Iran s Secret Blueprint for the
    Destruction of a Religious Community as well as a report on a press
    conference by the President of the Central Revolutionary Court in Kayhan
    Newspaper Nr. 11488 published on 20 January 1982 (30 Day 1360), A Faith
    Denied: The Persecution of the Baha is of Iran by the Iran Human Rights
    Documentation Centre, and other reports provided by the Baha i
    International Community. Mr. Amin Amin, a member of the Baha i legal
    affairs committee, was involved in defending the human rights of the Baha
    is in Yazd during the wave of persecution against the Baha is in the 1950
    s [See Section 3.2, A Faith Denied: The Persecution of the Baha is of
    Iran]. He was elected as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of
    the Baha is in August 1980 [Gulistanih, p.95]. The Baha is in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have
    subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the
    largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in
    1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their
    most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under
    the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to
    it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the
    time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified
    and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention Mr. Amin Amin was arrested
    on December 14, 1981 (23 Azar 1360) following a meeting of the National
    Assembly. The meeting was hosted at the home of a member of the Baha i
    community. After their meeting came to an end, the guests began to leave
    discreetly in order to not draw attention to their gathering, as was often
    the case during the early days of the revolution. A few minutes after the
    first two guests left, they were arrested by revolutionary guards who had
    surrounded the house. The guards then entered the house to arrest Mr. Amin
    Amin, the rest of the members of the National Assembly and the hosts. They
    held Mr. Amin Amin and everyone else against the wall, blindfolded them,
    all the while shouting and asking about the ninth member of the Assembly
    who was absent from that meeting. They then ordered Mr. Amin Amin and the
    others to get into specific cars. According to eyewitness reports, when
    asked where they were being taken and at whose order, the guards made no
    response. The group was taken to the building of the National Oil Company
    s Club, which served as Komiteh # 4 in Davudiyeh neighborhood. According
    to reports by two survivors, the morning after his arrest, the authorities
    gathered Mr. Amin Amin and the nine other Baha is arrested in an
    interrogation room and ordered them to fill out a questionnaire about
    names of Assembly members, relationship of the Baha is to Israel, and the
    amount and location of Baha i funds. The authorities interrogated him
    several times during his detainment. Trial The authorities provided no
    information to Mr. Amin A
