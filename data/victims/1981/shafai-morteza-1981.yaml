    The information regarding the execution of Mr. Morteza Shafa'i was
    released in a communiqu from the Esfahan Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal,
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on September 30, 1981. He was
    executed along with his wife and his 16-year-old son. Additional
    information about Mr. Shafa'i was obtained from the website of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He was born in Esfahan. He was a married
    medical doctor and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He
    provided financial support to the poor and created a fund to help pay for
    the health treatment costs for destitute patients. This execution was also
    reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes 12028 individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principals of
    Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of
    Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the
    Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic
    and social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention No detail
    information is available on Mr. Shafa'i's arrest and detention. He was
    arrested in May 1981, and was detained in Dastgerd prison in Esfahan.

    that it took place in Dastgerd prison, Esfahan, sometime in September
    1981. Charges Mr. Shafa'i was accused of "being a member of the armed wing

    Molotov cocktails and three way [explosives] in public places, [aiming] at
    the cars and shops of the revolutionary guards and those of the Basij and
    Hezbollahi people." The charges brought against her, along with 52 other
    victims, are collective and general. The prosecution does not mention any
    specific offense for a particular individual. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Shafa'i's defense.
    Judgment No detailed information is available on the defendant s
    execution. Mr. Morteza Shafa'i was executed by the firing squad in
    Dastgerd prison on September 27, 1981. ------------------------------ *
    The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of
    their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic
    Republic authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap
    between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin
    as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
    treatment by governmental officials and the government officials efforts
    to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact
    that the regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and
    Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from this
    demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were arrested
    and executed
