    The news about execution of Mr. Asghar Ja fari Jazayeri was announced by
    the public relations office of chief prosecutor of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court and was published in the Kayhan newspaper on September
    19, 1981. The press release reads as follows: For the cooperation of the
    heroic and the warrior people that belong to the party of God, the
    persistence of the army of the 20-million, and [the efforts] of the
    brothers in security forces, the hideous faces of the Hypocrites and the
    corruption nests of the hegemons mercenaries were exposed, hypocrisy is to
    be uprooted from our society, and the foundations for the Islamic social
    justice are being created. It is now more necessary than ever for this
    revolutionary nation to step forward and destroy the plots of the enemies
    of Islam. God willing and for the efforts of this vigilant nation, the
    death of the global imperialism is near. Mr. Ja fari is also one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Additional information
    regarding Mr. Ja fari Jazayeri was sent to the Boroumand Foundation via an
    electronic form by a person informed about his case. According to this
    information, Mr. Ja fari, son of Seyed Hossein, was born in Khorramabad in
    1954. He was a mathematics student at Tarbiat-Mo lem University
    (Pedagogical University) in Tehran. He was a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Minority, and his pseudonym was Javaheri. Despite the scarcity of
    information about Mr. Ja fari Jaza ri s case, the letters that he wrote in
    prison before the Revolution, indicate that he had a strong and caring
    personality. His will demonstrates that at the last hours of his life, Mr.
    Ja fariwas thoughtful of his financial and ethical obligations. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and
    was active mainly in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest
    and detention According to the information sent by the electronic form,
    Mr. Ja fari was arrested in a safe house in Tehran. Trial No information
    is available on the accused s trial. Charges Based on the press release by
    the public relations office of chief prosecutor of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court, the charges against Mr. Ja fari were as follows:
    supervising safe houses, participating in meetings, gatherings, and
    illegal armed demonstrations of the [ Fadaiyan Khalq Minority]
    Organization, and responsibility for communications with the Organization.
    The press release also states that Mr. Ja fari was charged with waging war
    against God, being corrupt on earth, being a member of the American
    Organization Peykar and one of the active members of the minority branch
    of the guerilla organization. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against Mr. Ja fari cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of Mr. Ja fari
    Jazayeri s execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against him. Defense No information is available on the
    accused s defense. Judgment The press release by the public relations
    office of chief prosecutor of the Islamic Revolutionary Court does not on
    which date Mr. Ja'fari was executed. According to the information provided
    by the addendum to the Mojahed magazine, he was executed by a firing squad
    on September 16, 1981 in Tehran.
