    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Reza Sa adat Niaki, son of Mohammad Reza,
    along with eighteen others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on
    September 19, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Public
    Prosecutor s Office issued an announcement concerning these executions,
    the defendants' names, and their charges, and released it to the Pars news
    agency. News of the execution of Mr. Sa adat Niaki was published in the
    Peykar publication, number 125, on November 2, 1981. According to this
    report, he was born to a middle-class family in Amol in 1952. He entered
    the Medical School of Tehran University in 1971. He began his political
    activities with the Marxist faction of the Mojahedin Khalq in 1976 and
    continued with the Peykar Organization after it was established. After the
    revolution, he was in charge of the Shomal Committee of Peykar. He was
    assigned to work as a doctor in Kordestan from 1979. He returned to Tehran
    in 1981. Additional information was sent by a relative of the defendant
    through an electronic form to the Omid site. According to this form, Mr.
    Sa adat Niaki was born to a middle-class family in Amol in 1953. He was an
    intern in Tehran University and worked as a doctor in Kordestan. He was a
    sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. He had three brothers and one
    sister. His brother, Mehran was killed in the Chalus prison when tortured
    on December 2, 1981. Mr. Sa adat Niaki is one of the 430 individuals whose
    names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh va
    Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the organization
    who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on
    this list have been executed. Mr. Alireza Sa adat Niaki is one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention According to the Peykar publication, Mr. Sa adat Niaki,
    along with three other sympathizers of Peykar, was arrested in a comrade s
    house in Tehran during an attack by the regime s agents in 1981. According
    to the electronic form, however, Mr. Sa adat Niaki was arrested in Mashhad
    and detained in the Evin prison, Section 209, and the Qezelhesar prison.
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Alireza Sa adat Niaki were announced as, "being an
    active member of the anti-people organization of Peykar, being in charge
    of logistics and connections for the Kordestan Committee of the
    Organization, and being in charge of propaganda in Amol and Babol for the
    Organization. According to the electronic form, the charge against Mr.
    Alireza Sa adat Niaki was atheist propaganda in Amol and Babol. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Sa adat Niaki's defense. Judgment َThe
    Central Islamic Revolutionary Court identified Mr. Sa adat Niaki as,
    "Mohareb (fighter) against God and the Prophet and Mofsed(corruptor on
    Earth)." He was condemned to death. The ruling was carried out and he was
    executed in the Evin prison yard in Tehran in September of 1981. According
    to the electronic form, Mr. Alireza Sa adat Niaki was executed by firing
    squad in the Evin prison yard on September 16, 1981.
