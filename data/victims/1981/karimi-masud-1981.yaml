    News of the execution of Mr. Masu'd Karimi, son of Mohsen, and 22 other
    individuals, was published in Kayhan newspaper and Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on Tuesday, August 18, 1981, quoting the communiqu of the Office
    of Public Relations of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s
    Office. The names and crimes of the accused have been stated in this
    announcement. Mr. Karimi is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Based on available information, Mr. Karimi was a
    supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Karimi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. According to the
    communiqu of the Office of Public Relations of the Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office, the Central Revolutionary Court tried
    Mr. Karimi and 22 other individuals. Charges The Office of Public
    Relations of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office has
    stated the charges brought against Mr. Karimi and 22 others as being
    terrorism, destruction, bombing, attacking Revolutionary Guard and
    Committee brothers, participating in the terrorist and fascist affair of
    June 20, assaulting and injuring the Moslem people [of Iran], armed
    uprising against the Islamic Republic Regime. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Karimi. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Karimi s defense. Judgment The Central Islamic Revolutionary Court
    declared Mr. Masu'd Karimi and 22 other individuals Mohareb with God and
    His Messenger ( One who wages war with God and the Prophet Mohammad, ) and
    Baqi against Islamic Rule ( One who has turned against Islam and Islamic
    Rule ) and sentenced them to death. The sentence was carried out on
    Tuesday, August 16, 1981, and he was shot by a firing squad at Evin
    Prison. Mr. Karimi was 20 years old. _________________________ *The
    exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of their
    centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic
    authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the
    two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites
    and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin
    sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while distributing
    publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20,
    1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by
    governmental officials and the government officials efforts to impeach
    their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the
    regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets,
    some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The
    number of casualties that resulted from this demonstration is unknown but
    a large number of demonstrators were arrested and executed in the
