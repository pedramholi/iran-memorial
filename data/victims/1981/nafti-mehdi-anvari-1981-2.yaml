    The execution of Dr. Mehdi Anvari Nafti, son of Masih, was announced by
    the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shiraz in Jomhouri Eslami (March 18th,
    1981) and Khabar Newspaper (March 18th, 1981). Additional information
    about Dr. Anvari Nafti was obtained through articles published in Kayhan
    Newspaper (August 16th, 1980), Iran News (April 12th, 1981), Baha i News
    Issue 610 (January, 1982), various documents published in the Archives of
    Baha i Persecution in Iran webpage (ABPI) and Asoo website (August 9th,
    2015). Dr. Anvari Nafti is also one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a
    1993 report published by the Baha i International Community. The report
    documents the persecution of the members of the Faith in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran and lists the members killed since 1978. Additional
    information has been drawn from various issues of The Baha i World . See
    for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Dr. Mehdi Anvari Nafti was
    born in 1921 in Taft, Shiraz (Jomhouri Eslami March 18th, 1981). He worked
    at his father s pharmacy from the age of 14, until opening his own store
    some 15 years later (ABPI, Bio). He married in 1956 and moved to Mashad
    with his wife so that she could attend medical school there. They later
    settled in Abadeh, where he became a member of the Local Spiritual
    Assembly and an assistant to the Auxiliary Board Members.(1) The Baha is
    in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979 (2)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(3) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Baha i National Spiritual Assembly After the
    Islamic Revolution In the organizational structure of the Baha i
    community, the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly is a body
    composed of nine individuals that are elected annually with the votes of
    adult Baha is in each country. This institution tends to the affairs and
    issues of the Baha i community on the national level. The National
    Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of guiding, coordinating, and
    moving forward the activities of each country s local spiritual
    assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl ( House of Justice
    ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the highest
    decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I s
    Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual
    assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz,
    were severely persecuted and the majority of their members were executed.
    In The Final Message of the Iran National Spiritual Assembly to the
    Friends of the Country , the Third Baha i National Spiritual Assembly,
    abiding by the principle of obeying the government, announced the closure
    of the Baha i organizations, and at the same time, sent an open letter to
    two thousand well-known and high-ranking government figures asking an end
    to the arrest, detention, torture, execution, and injustice against Baha
    is. (BBC Persian website, October 11, 2015). Judicial officials of the
    Islamic Republic have come up with [unreasonable and unacceptable]
    justifications for the persecution and the execution of the members of the
    National Spiritual Assemblies. In a speech on May 28, 1982, Ayatollah
    Khomeini said: The Baha is are not a religion, they re a [political]
    party; it s a party that was supported by Britai
