    Information about Mr. Vahid A inparast is based on an electronic form sent
    to Omid by a cousin of his friend, Fariborz Daneshmand. According to this
    information, he was a fifteen-year-old boy who, along with his friend
    Fariborz, went to watch a demonstration turning into a clash around
    Enqelab Square, in Tehran, in June of 1981. Mr. A inparast was the oldest
    child in his family. The electronic form sender remembers him as a
    youngster who loved to live, dressed well, and always smiled.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention
    on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offense committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. A inparast s arrest and detention are
    not known. According to information sent to Omid , he was arrested around
    Tehran s Enqelab Square, in 1981. According to his friend, Fariborz
    Daneshmand, when he and Vahid approached the demonstration location, they
    realized that there were some clashes; therefore, they ran away like
    others, but Vahid was arrested by plainclothes agents. The only contact
    that Mr. A inparast had with his family was a phone conversation that took
    place the same night, several hours after his arrest, during which he
    asked for his mother s help: Mother, tell them that I am not a sympathizer
    of any group. I was just there to watch. According to the electronic form
    sender, a man took the phone harshly and told his mother to go to the
    Komiteh for visitation the next morning. Trial No information is available
    on Mr. A inparast s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. A
    inparast s charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. A
    inparast. Defense No information is available about Mr. A inparast s
    defense. Judgment No specific information is available about Mr. A
    inparast s execution. According to the electronic form, Mr. Vahid A
    inparast was executed by firing squad in Tehran the day after his arrest
    in June of 1981. Authorities did not inform his family of the sentence.
    The family was only informed of the execution when they went to prison to
    visit him. This report quotes Vahid s mother, feeling a lump in her
    throat, saying, Vahid s voice and his entreaties are always in my ears. He
    was terrified and asked for my help. I could not do anything for him.
