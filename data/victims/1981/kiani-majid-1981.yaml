    News of the execution of Mr. Majid Kiani, son of Morad, along with
    fourteen others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August
    31, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Prosecution
    Office announced these executions in a statement. Mr. Kiani is one of the
    430 “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains
    the names of 400 members of the Organization who have been executed.
    Additionally, Mr. Kiani is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Kiani was a university student.
    The statement of the Central Revolutionary Prosecution Office states:
    “Hail to the fighters of the war against the world’s infidels under the
    leadership of blood-thirsty America, and hail to the heroic and
    martyr-producing nation, which obstruct criminals and merciless
    Hypocrites, and which reports these criminals against the Koran and Islam
    to the armed forces and the judiciary on a daily basis, and which accepts
    the calling of the Koran that ‘O Prophet, strive hard against the
    unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and be firm against them’” [9: 73]. The
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by
    a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The statement of the Central Prosecution Office asserts that Mr.
    Kiani was charged with lived “in a safe house of the Organization, was an
    active member of the Student Section of the American small group of
    Peykar, and was in charge of communications.” The statement also says that
    10 defendants, including Mr. Kiani were collectively charged with “having
    worked underground and served full-time for the hellish organization of
    Peykar and received salaries.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Kiani’s
    defense. Judgment َThe Central Islamic Revolutionary Court called Mr.
    Kiani “at war with God and His Prophet, corruptor on earth, and rebel.” He
    was condemned to death and shot by firing squad on August 29, 1981. He was
    21 years old.
