    Mr. Esma'il Bahraman is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Additional information about Mr.
    Bahraman is taken from the book Our Martyrs in the Path to Freedom by
    Rah-e Kargar publications, copyright 1988. He was born in Omidieh. He was
    a student in Jondishapur University of Ahvaz and a sympathizer of the
    Rah-e Kargar Organization. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    had rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action.
    They introduced themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown.
    According to the Rah-e Kargar book, Mr. Bahraman was arrested in Ramhormoz
    in late August 1981. During his last days, he was tortured so severely
    that his hand was barely attached to his body when he was executed. Trial
