    refused to deny his religion to protect his life. The news of the
    extrajudicial execution of Mr. Ezat ollah Atefi Afusi (also spelled "
    Izzat Atifi") , son of Jamileh and Mohammad Baqer, along with his brother,
    Bahman, and three other people, was obtained through Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center s interviews with Mr. Atefi Afusi s grandchild on March 18, 2012
    and June 15 and September 24, 2018 (ABC interview). Additional information
    in this regard was obtained through Abdorrahamn Boroumand Center s
    interview with an informed person who previously lived in the village of
    Afus on May 14, 2018 and documents available at Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center including a newsletter from the Baha i community and an October 6,
    1994 court order from an Islamic Revolutionary Court specially assigned to
    handle such cases per an order issued on September 7, 1989. Mr. Atefi is
    one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the
    Baha i International Community. The report documents the persecution of
    the members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the
    Baha is killed since 1979. Mr. Atefi was born in the village of Afus near
    Faridan, Esfahan, in 1927. He was a farmer, but also worked as a seasonal
    carpet yarn dyer. Because of his job and his honesty he had a good
    reputation and was well-known among the people in his village and the
    surrounding villages. He did not go to school, but learned to read and
    write. He was married with seven children. Mr. Atefi was a Baha i and had
    no political affiliation or connection with any political group. There was
    a long history of harassment of Baha is in areas where he worked and
    lived. One of Mr. Atefi s relatives had been murdered by some villagers at
    the provocation of Mullahs before the 1979 revolution. However, during
    more recent years (the interview were conducted in 2012), many people in
    the village have come to regret their behavior during the period when Baha
    is were arrested and executed. They now sympathize with the victims
    families. They regret cooperating with authorities and not opposing the
    executions. Because of his job and his honesty, Mr. Atefi had a good
    reputation and was well-known among the people in his village and the
    surrounding villages. Baha is situation in the village of Afus An informed
    person who previously lived in the village of Afus stated in an interview
    with Abdorrahaman Boroumand Center that about 100 Baha is had lived in the
    village of Afus before the Islamic revolution. According to the
    interviewee, about 13 Baha i families had lived in Afus, all of whom were
    driven out of the village shortly after the Islamic Revolution. Following
    the Islamic Revolution, the arrest order for the members of the Baha is
    Local Spiritual Assembly* in the village of Afus was issued and nine
    members of the Assembly left the village with their families for fear of
    harassment, persecution, arrest, and execution. After leaving the village,
    their properties, houses, and farms were confiscated, and they had no
    reason to return to their hometown. Background The authorities of the
    Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious
    community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300
    thousand members in 1979 ** - to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence. *** About 13 Baha i families had lived in Afus, all
    of whom were driven out of the village shortly after the Islamic
    Revolution. Arrest and detention On July 16, 1981, Mr. Atefi was arrested
    in his home by two agents of the Revolutionary Guards Headquarters and one
    plainclothes agent without any arrest warrant. According to the
    interviewee, the agents did not specify the reasons for detention. It was
    evident, however, that Mr. Atefi was arrested for being Baha i. Shortly
    before this arrest, the agents had arrested Mr. Atefi s brother as well.
    For more than 50 days, Mr. Atefi and his brother were held in Daran
    Prison, located 150 kilometers south of Esfahan. During this time, they
    did not have access to an attorney. In late August 1981, about two week
    prior to his extrajudicial death, Mr. Atefi visited his family for the
    last time (ABC interview). Trial According to available information, no
    court session was held to try Mr. Atefi. Mr. Atefi s family members are
    not aware of any court session, and Mr. Atefi never mentioned anything
    about a trial during his visitation with family. Charges According to the
    interviewee, Mr. Atefi s sole charge was believing in the Baha i religion
    . At his last visitation, Mr. At
