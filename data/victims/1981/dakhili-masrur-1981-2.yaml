    Information about the execution of Dr. Masrur Dakhili, son of Hossein and
    father of three, was released in a communique from the Public Relations
    office of the Tabriz Revolutionary Prosecutors Office published in Kayhan
    Daily Newspaper (August 3rd, 1981). Additional information was obtained
    from an Electronic Form submitted to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for
    Human Rights in Iran (ABC) on August 30th, 2007, and articles published by
    Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran and IranWire (December 12th, 2020).
    Dr. Masrur Dakhili is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993
    report published by the Baha i International Community. The report
    documents the persecution of the members of the Baha i faith in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran and lists those killed since 1978. Additional
    information has been drawn from various issues of The Baha i World . See
    for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Dr. Masrur Dakhili was born
    on November 10th, 1923, to a Baha i family in Maragheh, Azarbaijan
    province (IranWire). His father, Hossein Dakhili, was an employee of the
    Ministry of Post and Telegrams; he passed away when Dr. Khalili was 15.
    After finishing high school at 18, he moved to Tabriz to obtain a degree
    in electrical engineering, and was subsequently employed by Radio Tabriz
    as the Director (ABPI Bio, IranWire). At 25, Dr. Khalili attended medical
    school in Tabriz and was employed by the Red Cross in 1954. He married
    Farideh Sheikh-ol-Eslami in 1956, and they moved to Mahabad the next year
    where he was the director of the Respiratory Diseases unit at a hospital
    (ABPI Bio). For unkown reasons related to the political police SAVAK, he
    was forced to relocate to Tabriz where he retired in 1979. Following the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic and targeted attacks on several Baha
    i s, Dr. Khalili and his family relocated to Tehran. While there, he was
    informed that members of the Revolutionary Guard had confiscated their
    family home in Tabriz and were looking for him (IranWire). In his
    lifetime, Dr. Masrur Khalili, was a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly
    of Tabriz, and served as an Auxiliary Board Member (ABPI Bio). Dr. Khalili
    served his patients with generosity and benevolence, financially assisting
    patients of lower economic backgrounds. He was humorous and had a
    memorable smile that was known among his friends and patients (IranWire).
    The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of
    the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious
    community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300
    thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: "They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental.
    They will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: "Will
    they be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded:
    "No. Khomeini had previously "spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s
    regime, Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches.
    (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Spiritual Assemblies The affairs of the
    Baha i community are administered through a system of institutions, each
    with its defined sphere of action. At the local level, the affairs of the
    Baha i community are administered by the "Local Spiritual Assembly and
    nationally by a National Spiritual Assembly . In 1980 and 1981, the First,
    Second, and Third National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i
    Spiritual Assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan,
    and Tabriz, were severely persecuted and the majority of members were
    executed. Spiritual Assemblies have been banned by the Iranian government,
    denying Baha is the right to meet, elect, and operate their religious
    institutions. Judicial officials of the Islamic Republic have come up with
    [unreasonable and unacceptable] justifications for the persecution and the
    execution of the members of the National and Local Spiritual Assemblies.
