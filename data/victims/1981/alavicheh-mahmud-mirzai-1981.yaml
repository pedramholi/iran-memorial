    Information about Mr. Mahmud Mirza’i Alavicheh has been drawn from an
    electronic form sent to Omid by his brother. Mr. Mirza’i Alavicheh was
    born in Esfehan in 1959. As his older brother Ahmad (who was executed in
    1988), he became interested in the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1979.
    Having graduated from high school, he started his compulsory military
    service in Esfehan’s garrison, and voluntarily enlisted to serve in the
    military during the Iran-Iraq war. His return from war front coincided
    with the confrontations of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and the
    government of the Islamic Republic. He actively participated in such
    clashes despite military rules. When he was called to serve in Shahrekord
    (Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari province), he refused to go. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Mirza’i Alavicheh was arrested one day after the
    demonstration of June 20, 1981, organized by Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    According to his brother, “as many other sympathizers of this
    Organization, he was unaware of the significance and the consequences of
    the Demonstration of June 20. He thought of it as just another event in a
    series of struggles, such as the war, in the preceding months.” On June
    21, Mr. Mirza’i Alavicheh went to a public bathhouse called “Namnabat”
    located on Ebn-e Sina street in Esfehan, with a wounded arm. Around noon,
    forces from the Basij para-military group entered the bathhouse and
    arrested him for “absence from military service and participation in
    clashes against the regime.” Mr. Mirza’i Alavicheh was detained the base
    of the Revolutionary Guards, located in the former building of Savak
    political police headquarters. Despite the gathering of prisoners’
    families at prison, they were not allowed any visits. About 4 hours before
    the execution, at 11 p.m. on July 7, his brother Ahmad heard Mahmud’s
    voice saying that he thought he was to be transferred to a prison on an
    island in the Persian Gulf. The demonstration of June 20, 1981, took place
    in protest against the parliament’s impeachment of President Banisadr and
    the Islamic Republic’s systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) from the country’s political scene, the refusal of
    Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO leaders and his insistence for them to
    disarm. The MKO had until then supported the leadership of Ayatollah
    Khomeini and agreed to function within the framework of the new political
    system. On June 20th, the Organization officially changed its policy and
    tried to overthrow the regime by organizing mass demonstrations, in which
    some of the demonstrators were armed, all over the country. These
    demonstrations, which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing
    of dozens of demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and
    executions by the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that
    targeted not only the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive
    repression, unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic,
    legitimized as official government policy the months-old state harassment
    and suppression of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of
    independent political dissent. Trial There is no information regarding
    this trial. Charges Mr. Mirza’i Alavicheh was arrested for “absence from
    military service and participation in clashes against the regime.”
    Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence
    presented against the accused. Defense No information is available
    concerning Mr. Mirza’i Alavicheh’s defense. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the verdict leading to this execution. Mr.
    Mahmud Mirza’i Alavicheh was shot by a firing squad on July 8, 1981 at the
    base of the Revolutionary Guards Corps in Esfehan.
