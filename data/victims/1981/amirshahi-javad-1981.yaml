    The execution of Mr. Javad Amirshahi was announced in a public communiqué
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Semnan. The text of this
    communiqué was published in the Kayhan newspaper No. 11345 on Wednesday,
    the 29th of July 1981. Mr. Amirshahi is one of the 430 individuals whose
    name appears on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those members of the
    Organization who died after the Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the
    individuals on this list have been executed. The execution of Mr.
    Amirshahi was also announced in the addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No.
    261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization on the 6th of
    September 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to the communiqué of the Public Prosecution Office, the charges
    brought against Mr. Amirshahi are the following: 1. “Membership in the
    anti-Revolutionary Peykar Organization, which is at war with God;
    leadership in the development and implementation of the policies of the
    Organization; as well as being very active in this region” 2. “Preparation
    of false and treacherous reports against the Revolutionary Guards on the
    war front and weakening the soldiers’ moral” 3. “Creating cells for the
    theoretical and field activities of the organization and setting up
    training teams to advance the doctrinal agenda of the Organization” 4.
    “Reproduction and distribution of the Organization’s flyers, statements,
    and brochures, providing administrative and financial support for this
    Organization throughout Semnan” 5. “Apostasy, and diverting naïve and
    innocent youth” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on his defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Semnan declared Mr. Javad Amirshahi “corrupt and
    at war with God” and condemned him to death. The Supreme Judicial Council
    approved his death sentence. He was executed on the 23rd of July 1981.
    According to the background information on the communiqué of Public
    Prosecution Office, his body was buried in the cemetery assigned to
    non-Muslims.
