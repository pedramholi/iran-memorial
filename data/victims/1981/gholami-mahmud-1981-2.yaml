    The information about Mr. Mahmud Gholami has been drawn from an electronic
    form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. Mr. Gholami is
    also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    Additionally, the executions of Mr. Gholami along with 52 other persons
    were announced in the communiqué of the Public Relations of the Central
    Prosecutor’s Office, and published in the Kayhan newspaper on September
    29, 1981. Mr. Gholami was affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Gholami’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial According to the sender of the
    electronic form, Mr. Mohammad Taqi Hadidi, a co-defendant of Mr. Gholami,
    had said that one day they both, along with two other individuals, were
    blindfolded and taken to what, they were told, was their trial. First
    their names were asked and their affiliation with the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Once they all confirmed that they supported the
    Organization, they were asked if they were willing to cooperate in the
    arrest of other supporters of this Organization. They refused. Then the
    verdict was announced: two of them were sentenced to execution (Mahmud
    Gholami and Mehdi Zamani) and the other two to life imprisonment
    (including Mohammad Taqi Hadidi). The exact date of this session is
    unknown. Charges The communiqué of the Public Relations of the
    Prosecutor’s Office stated the collective charges brought against Mr.
    Gholami and 52 other individuals as “armed rebellion against the regime of
    the Islamic Republic, terrorism, attacking the brothers of the Basij [a
    para-military group] and the Revolutionary Guards, attacking the dormitory
    of the Basij, throwing cocktail Molotov to public [property] buildings,
    vehicles, and houses of the people of the Party of God.” The personal
    charges against Mr. Gholami are not known. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available concerning Mr. Zamani’s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Esfehan condemned
    Mr. Mahmud Gholami and 52 other individuals to death. They were shot by a
    firing squad in Esfehan on September 27, 1981.
