    News of the execution of Mr. Aliakbar Atrak, along with sixteen others,
    was published in the Kayhan newspaper on December 22, 1981. The Army
    Public Prosecutor s Office announced these executions, the defendants'
    names and their charges, and released this to the media. Additional
    information has been drawn from the indictment of other individuals who
    were also involved in the Nojeh coup, as published in the Jomhuri Eslami
    and Enqelab Esmali newspapers on July 20, 1980. Mr. Atrak was the manager
    of a Car Dealership. According to available information, the planners of
    the Nojeh coup were members of the armed forces and the Iran Party (social
    democrats and part of the Iranian National Front) who opposed the
    religious rule and believed in the separation of church and state. The
    core of the coup d tat plan was to fly aircraft from Nojeh base in Hamedan
    and bomb some military targets as well as the residence of Ayatollah
    Khomeini. Another team was to take over the radio-television building in
    Tehran in order to announce the coup and expose the motives to the
    population. Some Bakhtiari tribes were also participating in this coup.
    The Nojeh coup d tat plan was betrayed a few hours before being carried
    out. On July 9, 1980, the Islamic Republic of Iran authorities announced
    the discovering and dismantling of a civil and military network which had
    planned the coup d tat to overthrow the regime. Two months later, the
    organization Neghab, in a communiqu , claimed responsibility for this
    attempted uprising. The Organization attested that the path of Mossadegh
    is that of the people and today Bakhtiar is its authentic leader We have
    risen up to put an end to this curse [the Islamic regime] and to entrust
    the affairs of our land to the faithful disciple of Mossadegh Shapur
    Bakhtiar (Iran: In Defense of Human Rights, National Movement of the
    Iranian Resistance, Paris, 1983). Following the discovery of the plan for
    the coup, more than sixty officers and civilians were executed in several
    cities of Iran in less than a month. Most of the officers were still
    active in the army and had not been swept away in the first wave of purges
    which took place in the army after the fall of the monarchy. Executions of
    individuals involved in the Nojeh coup continued in the months and years
    to come; at least 200 persons were executed in connection with the coup.
    Nureddin Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh Party (the Iranian
    pro-Soviet communist party) mentioned the coup d tat in an article, dated
    May 2, 2000, posted on the Rah-e Tudeh website. Kianuri stressed the fact
    that the military branch of the Tudeh Party, which cooperated with the
    Islamic Republic s authorities, discovered and neutralized the above
    mentioned organization as well as other groups that planned a coup against
    the newly established regime. Arrest and detention There is no specific
    information on the Mr. Atrak s arrest and detention. Trial The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tehran Army tried Mr. Aliakbar Atrak. No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Aliakbar Atrak were announced: being in charge of purchasing
    vehicles for those involved in the coup, he purchased four station wagons
    and a jeep by receiving 400,000 Tomans cash. In addition to supplying
    vehicles and rides for those involved in the coup, he intended to supply
    weapons too. In an indictment dated July 19, 1980, the Public Prosecutor
    noted that those who planned the alleged coup d tat were supporters of the
    Shah and of the American imperialism who wanted to: bring about American
    social democracy and after two years of curfew and absolute oppression,
    put the monarchical system on referendum ( Jomhuri Eslami , July 20, 1980)
    The Public Prosecutor emphasized: This conspiracy was not planned in a
    vacuum and hence cannot be described in a single indictment; and these
    conspirators cannot be considered ordinary convicts. They are criminals
    who have undermined the newly regained truth, honor, and dignity of a
    liberated community of Muslim people. Considering this, and consulting
    verses of the holy Quran regarding the punishment of a rebel against the
    Islamic sovereign, it is imperative that the convicts receive their
    punishment according to the Shari a law. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    According to this report, during the investigation process, Mr. Atrak
    confessed that he heard about the coup from a person named Shoja Darvish,
    and he consciously agreed [to cooperate] with them. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Aliakbar Atrak's defense. It is not clear if he
    enjoyed the minimum standards of due process of law such as legal
    assistance of an attorney, etc Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Tehran Army identified Mr. Atrak guilty of "corruption on Earth and
    waging war on God." He was condemned to death. The ruling was carr
