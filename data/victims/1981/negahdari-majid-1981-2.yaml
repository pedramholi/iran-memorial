    The execution of Majid Negahdari and 14 other individuals was announced in
    the Kayhan newspaper on July 22, 1981. The Public Relations department of
    the Public Prosecution Office released the names of the convicted
    individuals to the media. Mr. Negahdari is one of the 430 individuals
    whose name appears on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those members of the
    Organization who died after the Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the
    individuals on this list have been executed. The Peykar magazine (the main
    publication of the Peykar organization), also referred to Mr. Negahdari in
    its issue 116, dated August 31, 1981. This execution was also announced in
    the addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin
    Khalgh Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes 12,028
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According to the Peykar
    , Mr. Negahdari was born in Shiraz on July 22, 1958. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China
    had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed
    all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    Public Prosecution Office did not release the charges brought against Mr.
    Negahdari to the media. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on his defense. Judgment In
    accordance with the verdict of the Revolutionary Tribunal, Mr. Majid
    Negahdari was executed by a firing squad at Evin Prison in Tehran on July
    22, 1981, on his 23rd birthday.
