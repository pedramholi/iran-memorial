    The Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor’s Office
    announced in a communiqué the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Ebrahimzadeh,
    son of Rahim, along with twenty two others. The communiqué was published
    in the Kayhan newspaper on November 12, 1981. Mr. Ebrahimzadeh is one of
    the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985.
    The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups,
    who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic
    security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    Moreover, Mr. Ebrahimzadeh is among the 430 individuals whose names appear
    on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. The
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by
    a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial,
    other than he was tried at the Islamic Rwevolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz.
    Charges The collective charges brought against Mr. Ebrahimzadeh and 8
    other men were announced as “armed rebellion against the Islamic Republic,
    distribution of leaflets and other publications of the Organization,
    apostasy, and living in safe-houses.” Personal charges against Mr.
    Ebrahimzadeh are not known. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ebrahimzadeh’s
    defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz condemned
    Mr. Ebrahimzadeh to death. He and 8 other men were shot by firing squad in
    Tabriz on November 9 or 10, 1981.
