    News of the execution of Ms. Farzaneh Samadi, daughter of Reza, along with
    twenty-two others, was published in the Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami
    newspapers on July 7, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central
    Public Prosecutor’s Office issued an announcement concerning these
    executions, the defendants' names, and their charges, and released it to
    the news agencies. An article about her was published in the Peykar
    publication, number 122, on October 12, 1981. Her name is mentioned on the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar, as well as
    the list of 12,028 individuals, published in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6,
    1985. The latter includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Ms. Samadi began her political activities with the Peykar
    Organization in 1980. She was a member of The Red Cell, a group of
    sympathizers of the Peykar organization in Kashan. As a teacher, she
    propagated the Organization’s views among the young students and others.
    The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges The Public Relations Department of the
    Central Public Prosecutor’s Office announced the charges against Mr.
    Farzaneh Samadi as "action against the Islam Republic Regime, activity to
    overthrow this regime, deceiving and misleading small and ignorant
    children, having a record of criminal activity against the Islamic
    Republic, and apostasy.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms. Samadi's defense.
    Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kashan identified Ms. Samadi
    as "a corruptor on earth, an enemy of God and a rebel." She was condemned
    to death. She was executed by firing squad in Evin prison on July 5, 1981.
    The court considered Ms. Samadi as apostate and prevented the burial of
    her body in the Muslim cemetery. She was buried in the non- Muslim
    cemetery without proper ceremonies.
