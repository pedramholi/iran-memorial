    The information about Ms. Khadijeh Arafteh has been drawn from an
    electronic form sent to Omid by a relative. Ms. Arafteh was born in
    Momseni (Fars province). She studied medicine and was affiliated with the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly in the
    political arena and the labor movement. The Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority)
    considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist
    regime and supported it. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic
    Republic targeted its members solely because of their political beliefs.
