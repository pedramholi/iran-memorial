    News of the execution of Mr. Morteza Farahmand, son of Azizollah, along
    with fourteen others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    August 31, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Prosecution Office
    announced these executions, the defendants’ names and their charges, and
    released it to the press. Mr. Farahmand is also one of the 430 individuals
    whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh
    va Peykar. Additionally, Mr. Farahmand is one of the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The communiqué of the
    Public Relations Department of the Prosecution Office states, “Greetings
    to the fighters of the battle against world infidels led by blood-thirsty
    America, and greetings to the nation which produces martyrs and heroes;
    [the nation that] impedes cruel and criminal Hypocrites and arrests a new
    group of them every day and brings them to the police or the judicial
    forces; [the nation that] accepts the calling of the Quran saying, ‘O
    Prophet! Strive hard against the unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and be
    firm against them.’” [IX: 73] The Peykar Organization for the Liberation
    of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to the announcement, the charges against Mr. Farahmand were
    announced as "being an active member of the apostate organization of
    Peykar and being in charge of Radio Peykar, especially during the May
    First program." Also, he and 14 others were chared with "having worked
    underground and served full-time for the hellish organization and received
    salaries." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Farahmand’s defense. Judgment
    َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran identified Mr. Farahmand as "an
    enemy of God and His Prophet, a corruptor on earth, and a rebel" and
    condemned him to death. He was executed by firing squad on August 29,
    1981.
