    The information regarding Mr. Shamsodin Amir Shahkarami’s execution was
    sent to Omid via electronic forms by a person familiar with this case and
    by a friend and cellmate of his. The sender of the second form spent a
    year with Mr. Amir Shahkarami in prison during the Shah period. According
    to his cellmate, Mr. Amir Shahkarimi was probably born in 1950 in Esfehan
    to in farmer family and held a high school diploma. He was involved in a
    religious movement in Esfehan in the previous regime and he was
    imprisoned. In prison he was introduced to Marxism and later he joined the
    Rah-e Kargar Organization. This execution was also reported in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They
    identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Shamsoddin Amir Shahkarami had been arrested and imprisoned under the
