    News of the execution of Mr. Khayam Qorbanpur, son of Mahbub, along with
    29 others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on December 1, 1981. The
    Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor’s Office
    issued an announcement concerning these executions, the defendants' names,
    and their charges, and released it to the Pars news agency. On December 4,
    1981, the Central Public Prosecutor’s Office issued a corrective
    announcement regarding the charges against five defendants. Additional
    information was sent by a friend of the defendant through an electronic
    form to the Omid site. According to this form, Mr. Khayam Qorbanpur was
    born to a middle class family in Tabriz in 1956. He was a student in the
    Technical Faculty of Tehran University. He entered the university in 1975.
    He was a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. Mr. Khayam Qorbanpur is
    one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of
    the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published
    on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of
    those members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979.
    More than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr.
    Khayam Qorbanpur is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to the electronic form, Mr. Khayam Qorbanpur was detained in the
    Evin prison in Tehran and interrogated by Lajvardi, Tehran’s Public
    Prosecutor at the time. The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges In the first announcement by the Central Public
    Prosecutor’s Office, the charges against Mr. Khayam Qorbanpur were
    announced as, "being a sympathizer of the communist organization of
    Peykar, membership in the Organizational Team, and having an illegitimate
    relationship with a girl as an organizational marriage." In the second
    announcement, the charges were announced as, "being an active sympathizer
    of the communist organization of Peykar, member in the Organizational
    Team, and one of the responsible members for the Student Section in
    Eastern Tehran. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Khayam Qorbanpur's defense.
    Judgment َThe Central Islamic Revolutionary Court identified Mr. Khayam
    Qorbanpur as, "Mohareb (fighter), Mofsed(corruptor on Earth), and Baghi
    (rebel) against the Islamic Republic of Iran." He was condemned to death.
    The ruling was carried out and he was executed by firing squad in Tehran
    on November 29, 1981. No exact information is available about the details
    of the court verdict.
