    The execution of Mr. Qodratollah Baqeri, a resident of Tir Tash, was

    towns of Sanandaj and Behshahr on July 13, 1981. This report mentions that
    Mr. Baqeri was a supporter of the "Mojahedin Khalq of Iran Organization or

    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial According to the
    newspaper report, Mr. Baqeri refused to reveal his identity during his
    detention and trial. No further information is available about this trial.
    Charges The report specifies that Mr. Baqeri and the four other convicts
    were charged with "threatening and intimidating Muslim people," "insulting
    the combatant clergy and the Islamic Republic," "repeated clashes with the
    people," "disseminating rumors and organizing demonstrations in favor of
    the impeached President Bani-Sadr, which demonstrations resulted in
    burning tires and throwing stones at security forces," "organizing secret
    political gatherings and team houses," "disturbing the mind of the youth
    by misleading them with wrong ideas," "distributing political leaflets and
    posters," "defending the political ideas of the People's Mojahedin
    Organization," "participating in disarming Revolutionary Guard brothers,
    and consistently opposing the Islamic Revolution." Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Baqeri's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Behshahr found Mr. Baqeri guilty of "corruption on earth" and
    "rebellion against God and the People". He was executed at dawn on July
    12, 1981.
