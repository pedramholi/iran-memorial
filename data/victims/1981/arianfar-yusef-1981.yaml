    The execution of Mr. Yusef Arianfar, son of Vali, along with 19 other
    individuals, was announced in a communiqué of Public Relations of the
    Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office and published in the Kayhan newspaper on
    September 12, 1981. Mr. Yusef Arianfar is one of the 430 individuals whose
    names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those members of the
    organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the
    individuals on this list have been executed. He is also one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Arianfar were announced as “membership in
    Peykar and Vahdat-e Enqelabi Organizations, reporting to the Organization
    from a glass factory, distributing banned leaflets in the factory,
    provoking workers, organizing strikes, recruiting members for the
    organization, corrupting individuals, and activity against the Islamic
    Republic regime.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Arianfar’s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qazvin condemned Mr. Yusef
    Arianfar to death. He was executed in Qazvin on September 8, 1981. He was
    24 years old.
