    News of the execution of Mr. Akbar Dadkhah, son of Azim, along with
    twenty-four others, was published in the (Kayhan) newspaper on October 19,
    1981, quoting a statement by the Public Relations Office of the Central
    Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s Office. The defendant s names
    and charges were published in this statement. Additional information is
    based on an electronic form sent to Omid by a person familiar with his
    case. This execution was also reported in an addendum to the (Mojahed)
    magazine (No. 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985.
    The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. According to the electronic form report, Mr. Akbar Dadkhah, 16,
    was an eighth-grade student and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. International laws have strictly prohibited capital
    punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offense committed before the
    age of eighteen. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary,
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released, along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members, based on
    Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the
    Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini
    and supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene
    and infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention According to the electronic form, Mr.
    Akbar Dadkhah was arrested for being a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, in Tehran, during the summer of 1981. He was interrogated at
    the Evin prison, where his spinal cord was injured due to torture. Mr.
    Dadkhah was denied an attorney. Trial According to the statement by the
    Public Relations Office of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor s Office, the Islamic Revolutionary Court had issued the ruling
    against Mr. Dadkhah and twenty-four others. No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges According to the Public Relations Office of
    the Central Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s Office, the charges
    against Mr. Akbar Dadkhah were announced as: making Molotov cocktails and
    participation in operational team activities; extensive activities in
    organizational teams and being present in team houses; and participation
    in street meetings and bloody clashes. According to the electronic form,
    the charge against Mr. Dadkhah was his sympathy and his activity for the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the electronic
    form, the evidence provided against Mr. Dadkhah was possession of a
    pamphlet of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Defense According to the
    electronic form, Mr. Dadkhah was denied an attorney. No information is
    available regarding his defense. Judgment The Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Court identified Mr. Akbar Dadkhah as Mofsed (corruptor on
    Earth) and condemned him to death. He was executed by firing squad in the
    Evin prison. According to the electronic form, the ruling was carried out
    on October 16, 1981, while he was in a wheelchair. Mr. Dadkhah was 16
    years old. ------------------------------------- * The exclusion of MKO
