    The execution of Mr. Gholam Reza Karverdian Chapchi, a resident of Tehran,
    and three others was announced in a communique of the public relations
    office of the Chief Public Prosecutor on December 6, 1981(Jomhuri Eslami
    daily). The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired
    by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America,
    was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    In 1981, the organization, which had opted for open political and
    electoral activity after the revolution, split over the critique of the
    concept of urban guerilla warfare and the support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic
    Republic, and though it did not abandon the theory of armed struggle, its
    activities were mainly limited to the political arena and the labor
    movement. Following the Mojahedin Khalq Organization s June 21st
    declaration of armed struggle, the Fadaiyan announced the organization of
    combatant cells. However, based on available information, these cells did
    not become operational. Many of the groups members and supporters were
    arrested and executed in the early 1980 s. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.

    publications in Karaj", "participating in the demonstrations of January 7,
    1981", and "planning a terror attack against the guard at the passport
    office in order to steal his gun." Evidence of guilt No details of
    evidence presented against Mr. Karverdian Chapchi are available. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Karverdian Chapchi's defense. Judgment

    sentenced to death.
