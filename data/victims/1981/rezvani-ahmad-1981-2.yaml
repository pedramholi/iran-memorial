    was killed extrajudicially, only because he was a Baha i. The news of the
    extrajudicial death of Mr. Ahmad Rezvani (also spelled "Ridvani") along
    with four other people, was obtained through Abdorrahman Boroumand Center
    s interviews with an informed person on March 18, 2012 (ABC interview).
    Additional information in this regard was obtained through Archives of
    Baha i s Persecution in Iran s website (ABPI website). Mr. Rezvani is one
    of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report documents the persecution of the
    members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is
    killed since 1979. Mr. Rezvani was born in April 23, 1926 in the village
    of Chigan, Faridan County, Esfahan Province. He was known as a
    hard-working man. Mr. Rezvani was a Baha i and because of that, he
    suffered much persecution at the hands of people in his village. He
    married at the age of 26 and then moved to the Qaleh-ye Malek village to
    promote his religion. Shortly after the Islamic revolution in 1979, the
    persecution against the Baha is was intensified. In 1981, Mr. Rezvani s
    family and another Baha i family in the Qaleh-ye Malek village were forced
    to flee their village and move to Esfahan. After about 40 days, the
    village s council send them a letter and assured them that if they
    returned to the village, they would be safe. Although he did not trust
    that promise, Mr. Rezvani returned to the village (ABPI website). In 1981,
    due to the harassment of Baha is, Mr. Rezvani s family was forced to flee
    their village and move to Esfahan. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected
    the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest
    religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979*- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.** Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the time
    of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified and
    institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah
    Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain instances,
    even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to Iran, in
    response to a question regarding political and religious freedom of Baha
    is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated:
    They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They will
    not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they be
    free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Mr. Rezvani did not access to a lawyer during
    his detention. Arrest and detention On August 17, 1981, Mr. Rezvani was
    arrested upon returning the Qaleh-ye Malek village. Shortly after the
    arrest, he was transferred to Daran Prison, located 150 kilometers south
    of Esfahan. He did not have access to a lawyer during his detention (ABPI
    website). Trial According to available information, no court session was
    held to try Mr. Rezvani. Charges According to the interviewee, Mr. Rezvani
    s sole charge was believing in the Baha i religion (ABC interview). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Mr.
    Rezvani s sole charge was believing in the Baha i religion . Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against Mr. Rezvani. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Rezvani s defense. The representatives of the Baha i
    community stress that their members are being persecuted for their
    religious beliefs. They note that Baha is requests to access their files
    are usually denied, and access to attorneys is often denied. However, the
    representatives of the Baha i community stress that their members are

    requests to access their files are usually denied, and access to attorneys
    is often denied. They refute the validity of charges such as
    counter-revolutionary political activities or spying leveled against them
    in Iranian courts. They point out that the fundamental principles of their
    religion require them to show loyalty and obedience to their government
    and refrain from any political involvement. They believ
