    Information about the execution of Dr. Parviz Firuzi, son of Reza and
    father of two, and 8 other Baha is was obtained from a communique from the
    Public Relations office of the Tabriz Revolutionary Prosecutors Office,
    published in Kayhan Daily Newspaper (August 3rd, 1981). Additional
    information covering his biography were included in an article from the
    Archives of Baha i Persecutions in Iran titled Parviz Firouzi- Executed by
    firing squad in Tabriz on 29th July 1981 and an IranWire feature titled
    Executed by the Revolutionary Court: A Baha i Pharmacist and His Father
    (January 29, 2021). Dr. Parviz Firuzi is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is
    listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i International Community.
    The report documents the persecution of the members of the Baha i faith in
    the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists members killed since 1978.
    Additional information has been drawn from various issues of The Baha i
    World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Dr. Parviz
    Firouzi was born on April 5th, 1942 in Tabriz, East Azarbaijan Province
    (ABPI). At a very young age, his family relocated to Ahar, where he
    obtained his elementary education, before moving back to Tabriz to
    complete his High School Diploma (ABPI). Dr. Firuzi received a doctorate
    degree from the College of Pharmaceutical Medicine at Tabriz University
    (ABPI) in 1969. Following graduation, he served in the Health Corps in
    Qasr-e Shirin for a short time, before returning to Tabriz where, after
    facing a period of unemployment, he was put in charge of running a
    pharmacy on Shahpur Street (IranWire). In Tabriz, Dr. Firuzi served as an
    assistant to the Auxiliary Board(1), before being elected to the Local
    Spiritual Assembly of Tabriz in 1979 (ABPI). A few months after his
    election, Dr. Firuzi s house was raided by armed agents who confiscated
    his documents (IranWire). After reporting the incident to the police, he
    was summoned to the Revolutionary Court of Tabriz, where he was accused of
    insulting government officials and threatened to be punished with 80
    lashes. The punishment was not carried out (IranWire). The Baha is in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979(2)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(3) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Baha i National Spiritual Assembly After the
    Islamic Revolution In the organizational structure of the Baha i
    community, the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly is a body
    composed of nine individuals that are elected annually with the votes of
    adult Baha is in each country. This institution tends to the affairs and
    issues of the Baha i community on the national level. The National
    Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of guiding, coordinating, and
    moving forward the activities of each country s local spiritual
    assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl ( House of Justice
    ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the highest
    decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I s
    Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual
    assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz,
    were severely persecuted and the majority of their members were executed.
