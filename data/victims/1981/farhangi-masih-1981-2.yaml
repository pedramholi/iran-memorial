    The information regarding the life and execution of Dr. Masih Farhangi
    originates in a publication entitled: The Biography and Good Services of
    Dr. Masih Farhangi (Biography), edited by his daughter, Dr. Farhang
    Farhangi, and published in 2017 in Ontario, Canada. This Biography
    contains the transcripts of excerpts of Mrs. Alavian s interview about Mr.
    Farhangi and his religious activities; it also includes the memoirs of his
    spouse Mrs. Qamar-ol-Moluk Seif (Farhangi). Mr. Masih Farhangi is also one
    of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report documents the persecution of the
    members of the faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is
    killed since 1978. Additional information has been drawn from various
    issues of the The Baha i World (See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986,
    Haifa 1994.) The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    Baha i religious community is the largest minority group in Iran, with
    approximately 300,000 members in 1979 (more current figures are not
    available).* The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected Baha
    is to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of an official religious minority; they cannot
    profess and practice their faith and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence. About Dr. Masih Farhangi Mashih Farhangi s father converted
    to the Baha i religion when he was still a young man. His son Masih
    officially became a Baha i when he reached the age of 15. In 1937 Masih
    graduated from medical school, and a year later in 1938 he married
    Qamar-ol-Moluk. Together they had two daughters, Farhang and Shahla, and
    two sons, Fariborz and Shahbaz. As he started to practice medicine he also
    became active in Baha i community life in Iran. He joined the Baha'i
    continental board of counsellors**, and served in the Baha i spiritual
    assemblies*** of Iran and Iraq. During his life, Dr. Farhangi travelled
    extensively around the world to promote Baha i religion. He was very
    popular among his patients. In Iran s northern city of Rasht, where he
    used to practice, his patients affectionately nicknamed him Dr. One
    Prescription, meaning he was able to cure his patients with the first
    prescription. According to his spouse, he would not charge destitute
    patients, and was willing to go to patients who were unable to go to his
    office ( Biography , p. 170). He loved reading and had a fine wit and
    beautiful handwriting. Painting was his favorite hobby, and he took
    pleasure in copying paintings of the masters. Dr. Farhangi also loved
    poetry and literature, and he himself wrote poetry ( Biography , p.
    174-93). A few months before the victory of the Islamic revolution in
    Iran, Islamist militants intensified their activism against active
    notables of the Baha i community and targeted Dr. Farhangi.. One day the
    son of a cleric slapped him in the street ( Biography , p. 123). Dr.
    Farhangi filed a complaint at the police station but the police did not
    follow up on his complaint. With the intensification of the pressure on
    him and his family, Dr. Farhangi closed his practice in Rasht and moved to
    the capital city, Tehran. According to Ms. Farhangi, the family had the
    opportunity to live outside Iran, but Mr. Farhangi preferred to continue
    to serve his fellow Iranians, which he did, even when imprisoned in Evin
    Prison. Fellow prisoners who visited his family reported that Mr. Farhangi
    was a great help to them and others in prison who were sick and in
    distress ( Biography , p. 123-24, 142-44, 153). Arrest and detention Mrs.
    Farhangi who was home at the time of arrest, reports that at 8:00 PM on
    February 7, 1980, two revolutionary guards, one of whom was armed, rang
    the home doorbell and pushed their way into the house: First they cut the
    telephone line and took our phonebook. Two other individuals joined them
    shortly after and started to search the house: They emptied all our
    suitcases in the middle of the room as if they were looking for money and
    jewelry. The other two took all the books and put them in large bags they
    took everything they found out of the house: camera, tape-recorder, radio,
    money, jewelry This lasted until midnight When they finished, they made a
    list and told Masih to sign it. He said, What should I sign: for all I
    know you may have put drugs in the bags, and then you would charge me with
    trafficking? The guards emptied the bags to show he had not put anything
    else in them. And they took Masih with them. Masih said goodbye [to us]
    and asked us to remain calm. ( Biography , p.129). In her account, Mrs.
    Farhangi does not mention any arrest warrant. After two da
