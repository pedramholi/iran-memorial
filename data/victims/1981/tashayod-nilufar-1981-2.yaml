    Ms. Nilufar Tashayod’s execution was announced in the addendum of the
    Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated
    with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes
    with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the
    publication date of the magazine. Additional information about Ms.
    Tashayod is taken from the book Our Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism by
    Rah-e Kargar Publications and an electronic form sent to Omid by an
    individual familiar with this case. The recollections of one of her
    cellmates, Mahtab P., published on the Didgah website have also helped
    provide the information about Ms. Tashayod. Ms. Nilufar Tashayod was born
    in a well-to-do family in Tehran in 1965. She was still young when in 1971
    her two brothers were arrested for political activity against the
    monarchy. Visits with her brothers at prison as well as her parents’
    relations with families of other political prisoners led Nilufar to become
    interested in politics. She started her political activity two years after
    the 1979 Revolution in the students’ unit of the Rah-e Kargar
    Organization. She distributed leaflets at school and petitioned for the
    formation of a school council with the participation of students. She was
    expelled from the Tarbiat high school for her political activities. Her
    older brother, Ali Reza Tashayod, an active member of the Rah-e Kargar
    Organization, was arrested in 1982 and executed during the mass killing of
    political prisoners in 1988. Her other brother, Mohammad Ali was a member
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and had a secret life due to his
    political activities. “Rah-e Kargar” or the “Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran” was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They
    identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini’s leadership. Arrest and detention
    According the above book, Ms. Nilufar Tashayod was arrested during the
    demonstration of June 20, 1981. She was detained in a section of Evin
    prison known as “the apartments.” She tried to keep her real identity from
    the prison authorities due to her brothers’ political activism. After her
    real identity was disclosed, she was interrogated on various occasions and
    tortured. According to the recollections of one of her cellmates published
    in the Didgah website, she was once flogged so much with cables that she
    urinated blood after she returned to the cell. (Extreme foot whipping
    causes internal hemorrhage.) The demonstrations of June 20, 1981, were a
    protest of the parliament’s impeachment of President Banisadr and the
    Islamic Republic’s systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) from the country’s political scene, the refusal of
    Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO leaders and his insistence on
    disarming them. Until that day, the MKO had supported the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function within the framework of the new
    political system. On June 20th, the Organization officially changed its
    policy and tried to overthrow the regime by organizing mass demonstrations
    throughout the country, in which some of the demonstrators were armed.
    These demonstrations, which were severely suppressed and resulted in the
    killing of dozens of demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass
    arrests and executions by the Revolutionary Guards and para-military
    forces that targeted all opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized the
    months-old state policy of harassment and suppression of dissidents and
    resulted in the banning of all forms of independent political dissent.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. She was denied
    the right to legal council and any visitation rights. Charges No
    information is available on Ms. Nilufar Tashayod’s charges. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available about
    her defense. Judgment No specific information is available about her death
    sentence. According to the Mojahed magazine, Ms. Nilufar Tashayod was
    executed by a firing squad on September 19, 1981. Her cellmate, Mahtab P.,
    says she was executed on the 20th and states that the watch that Nilufar
    had given her as a souvenir stopped on September 20. At the time of her
    execution, Nilufar was only 15 years old. Her cellmate describes her last
    hours and writes: “I lay next
