    News of the execution of Mr. Kheyrollah Hosseini, son of Seifollah, along
    with 22 others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August
    12, 1981. He is also one of the 430 individuals whose name appears on the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list
    contains the names of those members of the Organization who died after the
    Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Additionally, his name is mentioned in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    1985. According to the form, he was a mathematics teacher. Moreover, the
    book From an Ebullient Ideal published by former sympathizers of the
    Peykar Organization in August of 1985. Mr. Hosseini was a sympathizer of
    the Peykar Organization and active in the Mahalat section of the
    organization in Tabriz. His will was dated August 9, 1981. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges Mr. Hosseini and 4 other defendants were collectively charged with
    “armed uprising against the Islamic Republic, membership of the American
    group-let of Peykar, publication and distribution of leaflets for the
    abovementioned Organization, establishing cells and groups for
    overthrowing the Islamic Republic, and being in charge of the Peykar
    Organization in East Azarbaijan.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Hosseini’s defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz
    called Mr. Hosseini “at war with God amd His Prophet and an apostate.” He
    was executed by firing squad in Tabriz prison on August 9, 1981.
