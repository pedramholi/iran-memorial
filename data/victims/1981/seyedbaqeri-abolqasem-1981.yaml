    The information about Mr. Abolqasem Seyedbaqeri has been sent to Omid by
    someone familiar with this case. Mr. Seyedbaqeri is also one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No. 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) in 1985. The list
    includes individuals affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Before the
    Islamic Revolution in 1979, Mr. Seyedbaqeri was a member of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization. He was in close contact with the families of political
    prisoners of the previous regime. He was arrested prior to the Revolution
    and was condemned to death; however, because of the mediation of a person
    close to the Monarch, his sentenced was reduced to life in prison. He was
    released from prison in October or November of 1978, along with other
    political prisoners, and resumed his activities with the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization. In the following months, he and some friends started the
    publication of the Kar magazine, the main publication of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization. After a split within the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization,
    he joined the Minority faction and was in charge of the military wing in
    the north of Iran. As repression of political dissidents intensified in
    June 1981, many activists were arrested and executed, and Mr. Seyedbaqeri
    was forced to go into hiding. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements in Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their
    support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan
    Khalq Minority group opposed the Islamic Republic and was most active in
    the political arena, and in the labor movement. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Seyedbaqeri was arrested in August or September of 1981 and transferred to
    Evin prison. He had been living in hiding prior to his arrest but visited
    his mother at night. His mother, who was worried about him, told some
    relatives about the visits with her son. A Hezbollahi relative informed
    the authorities of Mr. Seyedbaqeri’s affiliation and whereabouts. (
    Hezbollah means the ‘party of God,’ referring to individuals who actively
    supported the Islamic Republic and of those who informed authorities of
    “counter-revolutionaries”). During his last visit with his mother, agents
    of a revolutionary committee surrounded their house, jumped over the
    walls, and entered. In order to protect his mother from harm, Mr.
    Seyedbaqeri surrendered to the state agents without resistance. During his
    detention, Mr. Seyedbaqeri’s family members visited various branches of
    the revolutionary committees, the headquarters of the Revolutionary
    Guards, and the Qasr and Evin prisons, but the authorities refused to
    inform them of his whereabouts. Trial No information is available about
    the trial of Mr. Seyedbaqeri. Charges The charge brought against Mr.
    Seyedbaqeri is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available about Mr. Seyedbaqeri’s
    defense. Judgment On September 16, 1981, the national radio announced,
    “Qasem Seyedbaqeri son of Mohammad,” among the names of individuals who
    had been executed. Having heard the news, his family members visited Evin
    prison many times in order to retrieve his body and his belongings. After
    a few visits, prison authorities told them that there were no belongings
    and that his body had been buried, without telling them in which cemetery
    he was buried. Having contacted other families whose loved ones were
    recently executed, the Seyedbaqeri family found out that bodies were
    buried in a cemetery on the way to Khavaran, known as the Cemetery of
    Armenians. They went to this cemetery only to find out that the graves did
    not bear the name of the person buried there. Mr. Seyedbaqeri’s family
    members consulted other relatives and decided to find the driver of the
    ambulance, who transported bodies to the cemetery. They cautiously
    observed the cemetery, found the ambulance driver and followed him home.
    Some of Mr. Seyedbaqeri’s family members went to the driver’s house one
    night, begged and bribed him to give them the burial location of
    Abolqasem. The driver, who was frightened of the authorities, nevertheless
    told the family members the location of the grave. They exhumed
    Abolqasem’s body from the grave. They noticed bullet wounds on his body.
    Abolqasem was still wearing the same clothes that he was wearing at the
    time of his arrest. Afterwards, the family frequently visited the
    cemetery. State agents and Basiji officials insulted them when they
    visited. Once, a young man of Basij (a paramilitary gro
