    News of the execution of Mr. Nosratollah Biranvand (wrongly published as
    Nosrat Birum Vand), along with eighteen others, was published in Keyhan
    and Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on August 16, 1981. The Public Relations
    Department of the Revolutionary Prosecution Office of Tehran issued a
    communiqu about the executions and released it to the Pars news agency.
    Mr. Biranvand is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar magazine published a
    short article about him on September 21, 1981. The communiqu of the
    Revolutionary Prosecution Office, which calls the convicts sworn agents of
    the superpowers , begins with a reference to the Koran: It is but a just
    recompense for those who make war on God and His apostle and endeavor to
    spread corruption on earth, that they are being slain in great numbers, or
    crucified in great numbers, or have, in result of their perverseness,
    their hands and feet cut off in great numbers, or are being [entirely]
    banished from [the face of] the earth: such is their ignominy in this
    world . But in the life to come [yet more] awesome suffering awaits them
    [5:33]. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Biranvand are
    collective, vague, and include eighteen other defendants. In the
    announcement by the Revolutionary Prosecution Office there is no reference
    to a specific crime committed by any single defendant. The announcement
    charges Mr. Biranvand with being a high level member of the Communication
    and Financial department, and in charge of connections with the American
    Organization of Peykar. He and eighteen others were collectively charged
    with attacking innocent people, assault and battery, murder, frequenting
    the safe houses, activities for overthrowing the Islamic Republic regime,
    planning to assassinate officials, intending to carry out plans for world
    imperialism headed by the US. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Biranvand s defense.
    Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court called Mr. Biranvand an enemy of
    God and condemned him to death. He was executed in Evin prison in Tehran
    on August 15, 1981. He was 21 years old.
