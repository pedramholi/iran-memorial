    Ms. Tahereh Aqakhani Moqadam is one of the 1,533 executed prisoners listed
    by the Association of Iranian Women of K ln (Germany). The list, published
    on September 10, 1997, is entitled: A partial list of names of women
    executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran. This list has been updated by
    former political prisoners living in various countries. Also, Ms. Aqakhani
    Moqadam is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Additional information about Ms. Aqakhani Moqadam
    was sent to the Boroumand Foundation via an electronic form by a person
    informed about this case. According to this information, Ms. Aqakhani
    Moqadam, daughter of Noruz Ali, was born in Tehran in 1959. Her mother was
    a homemaker and her father was in the army. He passed away when she was
    eight. Ms. Aqakhani Moqadam was a physics student in Melli University and
    a sympathizer of the Nabard Organization, Khat-e Se . Her husband, Ali
    Alemzadeh, who was in charge of the Labor Committee of the Nabard
    Organization, was also executed with her on June 21, 2981. Nabard
    Organization (for the Struggle for the Liberation of Working Class) was
    founded by a small group of members after a split in the Peykar
    Organization in the summer of 1978. There were little or no principal or
    theoretical differences between Nabard and Peykar. Peykar was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. The founding tenets of Peykar included the
    rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet
    policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a
    Social imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. Nabard s activities, mostly publishing, ceased
    after the government's brutal crackdown on dissidents in 1981. Arrest and
    detention According to the information sent by the electronic form, Ms.
    Aqakhani Moqadam was arrested at her organizational house in 1980 and
    transferred to the Evin prison. According to her cellmates, she was
    tortured several times in spite of being pregnant. Ms. Aqakhani Moqadam
    was denied any visitation or phone calls due to what her interrogators
    called her lack of cooperation. Trial No information is available on Ms.
    Aqakhani Moqadam s trial. Charges The charges against the accused are
    unknown. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this accused
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. Evidence of guilt The report of Ms. Aqakhani Moqadam s execution
    did not provide any specific information on the evidence presented against
    her. Defense No information is available on Ms. Aqakhani Moqadam s
    defense. Judgment According to the information provided in the electronic
    form, Ms. Aqakhani Moqadam was executed in the Evin prison on June 21,
    1981. According to the the addendum to the Mojahed magazine, she was
    executed by a firing squad.
