circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Taj Mohammad Naruyi and five others was reported by
    the correspondent of the Ettela’at daily in Kerman (July 6, 1981). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr.
    Naruyi had been charged with "participation in creating a drug trafficking
    band and participation in selling 1 kilogram of heroin and 26 kilograms of
    hashish." Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    any information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Naruyi's defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman declared Mr. Naruyi a "corruptor
    on earth." The death sentence was carried out at 6:00 am.
