    Mr. Mas ud Asadi is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Additional information about Mr. Asadi s case was sent to the
    Boroumand Foundation via an electronic form by a person informed about
    this case. According to this information, Mr. Asadi, son of Haj Yahya, was
    born in Samirom. He had a Bachelor s degree in physics and was a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention According
    to the information sent by the electronic form, Mr. Asadi was arrested in
    Samirom in 1981. Trial No information is available on Mr. Asadi s trial.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Asadi are unknown. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against Mr. Asadi cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of Mr. Asadi s execution did not provide any specific information
    on the evidence presented against him. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Asadi s defense. Judgment According to the information sent by the
    electronic form, Mr. Asadi was executed in Samirom in 1981. According to
    the addendum to the Mojahed magazine, he was executed by a firing squad in
    public in Samirom in August/September 1981. *The exclusion of MKO members
    from government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing
    houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981,
    the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and
    assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the
    Islamic regime. * In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the
    impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they
    founded the National Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many
    of its members were expelled from France, they went to Iraq and founded
    the National Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which entered Iranian
    territory a few times during the Iran-Iraq war. They were defeated in July
    1988 during their last operation, the Forugh Javidan Operation. A few days
    after this operation
