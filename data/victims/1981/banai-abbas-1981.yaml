    News of the execution of Mr. Abbas Bana i, son of Mohammad, along with
    eighteen others, was published in Keyhan and Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on
    August 16, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central
    Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor s Office issued an announcement about
    this execution and released it to the Pars news agency. Mr. Abbas Bana i
    is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of
    the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published
    on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of
    those members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979.
    More than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr.
    Abbas Bana i is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. h3 Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Abbas Bana i are collective, vague, and include
    eighteen other defendants. In the announcement by the Central
    Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor s Office there is no reference to a
    specific crime committed by any single defendant. The announcement charges
    Mr. Abbas Bana i with attacking innocent people, assault and battery,
    murder, frequenting the organization s houses, activities for overthrowing
    the Islamic Republic regime, and planning to assassinate officials. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
