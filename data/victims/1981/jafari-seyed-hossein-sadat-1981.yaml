    The information about Mr. Seyed Hossein Sadat Ja’fari, son of Mohammad,
    was sent to Omid by a relative, through an electronic form. His execution
    was announced in a statement by the public relations department of the
    prosecution office of Tehran province (published in the Kayhan newspaper
    on September 19, 1981). Mr. Sadat Ja’fari is also one of the 12028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Sadat Ja’fari was
    born in Lahijan (in the northern province of Gilan) in 1961. He was a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization* and based on the
    information available, he was politically active during the revolution of
    1979. The statement of the prosecution office that announced his
    execution, begins with this verse of the Quran, “God has promised the
    hypocrites, both men and women, as well as the deniers of the truth, the
    fire of hell…” (IX: 68). The statement says, “Heroic and militant nation…
    with your cooperation and with the endeavors of the 20 million strong
    military of our brothers in the armed forces, the ugly face of hypocrites
    has been unveiled, and with the discovery of the den of corruption of
    mercenaries of the super-powers, duplicity will be uprooted from our
    society, and the society of Islamic justice will be founded… The Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecution Office has been established on the basis of
    Islamic rules and principles and is trying to create a healthy atmosphere
    and the realization of divine justice…” The statement goes on to announce
    the execution of “19 people who are at war with God and his prophet, and
    who are corruptors on earth.” Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. The Sadat Ja’fari
    family found out that he was arrested in July 1981 when security agents
    went to their house to search it. He was held incommunicado in Evin
    prison. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The
    newspaper report refers to the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran.
    Charges The prosecution office announced that Mr. Sadat Ja’fari was
    charged with “membership in the anti-people organization of Hypocrites [a
    name Iranian official use to refer to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization],
    living in safe-houses, being a member of sabotage and terror groups,
    having thrown Molotov cocktails at police stations as well as other public
    and private buildings, arson of automobiles, stores, and assassination of
    Revolutionary Guards.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Sadat Ja’fari’s
    defense. He was denied a defense attorney. Judgment Mr. Sadat Ja’fari was
    shot by firing squad on September 16, 1981 at Evin prison in Tehran. He
    was 20 years old. His family found out about the execution through a radio
    announcement. When they went to the prison to receive his body, will, and
    belongings, they were only given the location of his burial at the
    Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. * The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members’ interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah’s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization’s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly oppos
