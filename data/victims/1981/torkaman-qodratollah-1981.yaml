    News of the execution of Mr. Qodratollah Torkaman, son of Musa and a
    Major, along with sixteen others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on
    December 22, 1981. The Army Public Prosecutor s Office announced these
    executions, the defendants' names and their charges, and released this to
    the media. Additional information has been drawn from the indictment of
    other individuals who were also involved in the Nojeh coup, as published
    in the Jomhuri Eslami and Enqelab Esmali newspapers on July 20, 1980.
    According to available information, the planners of the Nojeh coup were
    members of the armed forces and the Iran Party (social democrats and part
    of the Iranian National Front) who opposed the religious rule and believed
    in the separation of church and state. The core of the coup d tat plan was
    to fly aircraft from Nojeh base in Hamedan and bomb some military targets
    as well as the residence of Ayatollah Khomeini. Another team was to take
    over the radio-television building in Tehran in order to announce the coup
    and expose the motives to the population. Some Bakhtiari tribes were also
    participating in this coup. The Nojeh coup d tat plan was betrayed a few
    hours before being carried out. On July 9, 1980, the Islamic Republic of
    Iran authorities announced the discovering and dismantling of a civil and
    military network which had planned the coup d tat to overthrow the regime.
    Two months later, the organization Neghab, in a communiqu , claimed
    responsibility for this attempted uprising. The Organization attested that
    the path of Mossadegh is that of the people and today Bakhtiar is its
    authentic leader We have risen up to put an end to this curse [the Islamic
    regime] and to entrust the affairs of our land to the faithful disciple of
    Mossadegh Shapur Bakhtiar (Iran: In Defense of Human Rights, National
    Movement of the Iranian Resistance, Paris, 1983). Following the discovery
    of the plan for the coup, more than sixty officers and civilians were
    executed in several cities of Iran in less than a month. Most of the
    officers were still active in the army and had not been swept away in the
    first wave of purges which took place in the army after the fall of the
    monarchy. Executions of individuals involved in the Nojeh coup continued
    in the months and years to come; at least 200 persons were executed in
    connection with the coup. Nureddin Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh
    Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet communist party) mentioned the coup d tat in
    an article, dated May 2, 2000, posted on the Rah-e Tudeh website. Kianuri
    stressed the fact that the military branch of the Tudeh Party, which
    cooperated with the Islamic Republic s authorities, discovered and
    neutralized the above mentioned organization as well as other groups that
    planned a coup against the newly established regime. Arrest and detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention.
    Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran Army tried Mr. Qodratollah
    Torkaman. No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    The Revolutionary Tribunal announced the charges against Mr. Torkaman as,
    Major (Sarhang) Qodratollah Torkaman, son of Musa, was a member of an
    airplane-hijacking gang and, through that gang, became aware of the coup.
    In addition to concealing the matter and failing to inform the responsible
    authorities, he was also extensively active in procuring weapons. He also
    attempted to recruit truck drivers to bring weapons from the western part
    of the country to Tehran. Letters belonging to him were obtained in prison
    that indicated his actions in the coup. He also tried inside the prison to
    use bribes to have the letters delivered to the people he intended.. In an
    indictment dated July 19, 1980, the Public Prosecutor noted that those who
    planned the alleged coup d tat were supporters of the Shah and of the
    American imperialism who wanted to: bring about American social democracy
    and after two years of curfew and absolute oppression, put the monarchical
    system on referendum ( Jomhuri Eslami , July 20, 1980) The Public
    Prosecutor emphasized: This conspiracy is not an isolated incident that
    can be addressed in the lines of an indictment, and these conspirators
    cannot be regarded as ordinary defendants before a court. They are
    criminals who have made a mockery of the truth, dignity, and honor
    regained by a nation that has been freed from bondage. In view of the
    foregoing, and with due consideration of the noble verses of the Qur an
    regarding the punishment of those who rebel (baghi) against an Islamic
    government, the issuance of a religious (shar ia) ruling is hereby
    requested . Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against the defendant
    was Some letters that had been discovered from him in the prison that
    demonstrated his activities in the coup. ( Kayhan , December 2, 1981)
    Based on the information released in July 1980 following the first
