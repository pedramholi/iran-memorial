    News of the execution of Mr. Reza Haj-Marzban, son of Mohammadhassan,
    along with sixteen others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on
    December 22, 1981. The Army Public Prosecutor s Office announced these
    executions, the defendants' names and their charges, and released this to
    the media. Additional information has been drawn from the indictment of
    other individuals who were also involved in the Nojeh coup, as published
    in the Jomhuri Eslami and Enqelab Esmali newspapers on July 20, 1980.
    According to available information, the planners of the Nojeh coup were
    members of the armed forces and the Iran Party (social democrats and part
    of the Iranian National Front) who opposed the religious rule and believed
    in the separation of church and state. The core of the coup d tat plan was
    to fly aircraft from Nojeh base in Hamedan and bomb some military targets
    as well as the residence of Ayatollah Khomeini. Another team was to take
    over the radio-television building in Tehran in order to announce the coup
    and expose the motives to the population. Some Bakhtiari tribes were also
    participating in this coup. The Nojeh coup d tat plan was betrayed a few
    hours before being carried out. On July 9, 1980, the Islamic Republic of
    Iran authorities announced the discovering and dismantling of a civil and
    military network which had planned the coup d tat to overthrow the regime.
    Two months later, the organization Neghab, in a communiqu , claimed
    responsibility for this attempted uprising. The Organization attested that
    the path of Mossadegh is that of the people and today Bakhtiar is its
    authentic leader We have risen up to put an end to this curse [the Islamic
    regime] and to entrust the affairs of our land to the faithful disciple of
    Mossadegh Shapur Bakhtiar (Iran: In Defense of Human Rights, National
    Movement of the Iranian Resistance, Paris, 1983). Following the discovery
    of the plan for the coup, more than sixty officers and civilians were
    executed in several cities of Iran in less than a month. Most of the
    officers were still active in the army and had not been swept away in the
    first wave of purges which took place in the army after the fall of the
    monarchy. Executions of individuals involved in the Nojeh coup continued
    in the months and years to come; at least 200 persons were executed in
    connection with the coup. Nureddin Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh
    Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet communist party) mentioned the coup d tat in
    an article, dated May 2, 2000, posted on the Rah-e Tudeh website. Kianuri
    stressed the fact that the military branch of the Tudeh Party, which
    cooperated with the Islamic Republic s authorities, discovered and
    neutralized the above mentioned organization as well as other groups that
    planned a coup against the newly established regime. Arrest and detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention.
    Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran Army tried Mr. Reza
    Haj-Marzban. No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    The charges against Mr. Reza Haj-Marzban were announced as, active
    participation in the unsuccessful Nojeh coup d etat in July 1980,
    substantial activity in helping anti-revolutionary elements to leave the
    country, membership in the leadership of the military branch of the coup,
    training the personnel of the military branch including Rokni, and
    supplying the bus for transporting participants of the coup d etat from
    Tehran to Nojeh Base as the most sensitive part of the coup. In an
    indictment dated July 19, 1980, the Public Prosecutor noted that those who
    planned the alleged coup d tat were supporters of the Shah and of the
    American imperialism who wanted to: bring about American social democracy
    and after two years of curfew and absolute oppression, put the monarchical
    system on referendum ( Jomhuri Eslami , July 20, 1980) The Public
    Prosecutor emphasized: This conspiracy was not planned in a vacuum and
    hence cannot be described in a single indictment; and these conspirators
    cannot be considered ordinary convicts. They are criminals who have
    undermined the newly regained truth, honor, and dignity of a liberated
    community of Muslim people. Considering this, and consulting verses of the
    holy Quran regarding the punishment of a rebel against the Islamic
    sovereign, it is imperative that the convicts receive their punishment
    according to the Shari a law. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    did not provide any specific information on the evidence presented against
    the defendants. Defense No information is available on Mr. Reza
    Haj-Marzban's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran
    Army identified Mr. Reza Haj-Marzban as "Mofsed (corruptor on Earth) and
    Mohareb (fighter) against God." He was condemned to death. The ruling was
    carried out when he was exec
