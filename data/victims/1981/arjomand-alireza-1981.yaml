    News of the execution of Mr. Alireza Arjomand, son of Mokhtar, is based on
    an electronic form sent to Omid by a person familiar with his case. This
    execution was also reported in an addendum to the (Mojahed) magazine (No.
    261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups,
    who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic
    security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    According to the existing information, Mr. Alireza Arjomand, 27, had nine
    years education and was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and to recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Alireza Arjomand
    s arrest and detention are unknown. Trial No information is available
    regarding the defendant s trial. Charges No information is available on
    Mr. Alireza Arjomand s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against Mr. Alireza Arjomand.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Alireza Arjomand's defense.
    Judgment According to the existing information, Mr. Alireza Arjomand was
    condemned to death and was executed by firing squad in Estahbanat on
    August 23, 1981. Mr. Alireza Arjomand was 27 years old.
    ---------------------------------- * The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981,
    the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and
    assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the
    Islamic regime. In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the
    impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they
    founded the National Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many
    of its members were expelled fromFrance, they went toIraqand founded the
    National Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which entered Iranian territory
    a few times during the Iran-Iraq war. They were defeated in July 1988
    during their last operation, the (Forugh Javidan) Operation. A few days
    after this operation, thousands of imprisoned Mojahedin supporters were
    killed during the mass executions of political prisoners in 1988. Ever
    since the summer of 1981, the MKO has continued its activities outside
