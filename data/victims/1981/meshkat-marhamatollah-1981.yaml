    Charges The charge against Mr. Marhamatollah Meshkot was announced as,
    repeated adultery. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports ind Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year
    Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Marhamatollah
    Meshkat's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kazerun
    identified Mr. Marhamatollah Meshkat as Mofsed (corruptor on Earth) and
    condemned him to death. The ruling was confirmed by the Islamic Republic
    Justice Court. He was executed by firing squad in Kazerun. No specific
    information is available about the date of this execution.
