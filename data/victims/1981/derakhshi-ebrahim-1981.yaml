    News of the execution of Mr. Ebrahim Derakhshi, son of Amin, along with 42
    others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on September 30, 1981. The
    Public Relations Department of the General Public Prosecutor s Office
    informed the media of a communiqu issued by the Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor s Office of the Islamic Republic. News of the executions,
    names, and charges against defendants are reflected in this communiqu .
    Additional information is based on several electronic forms sent to Omid
    by persons familiar with this case. Mr. Ebrahim Derakhshi is also one of
    the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No.
    261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes individuals - affiliated with various opposition groups - who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According
    to the existing information, Mr. Ebrahim Derakhshi, 23, was born in Takab.
    He was single, a student, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary,
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam to be their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology.
    In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were
    imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a split within the
    Marxist-Leninist section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the
    imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along with other
    political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to recruit new
    members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    primary in the organization s agenda. During the first two years after the
    Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic s leaders. * Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Derakhshi s arrest and detention are not known.
    According to the communiqu issued by the Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s
    Office of the Islamic Republic, it is possible that Mr. Derakhshi was
    arrested during the demonstration of September 27, 1981, and spent only
    two days in detention. Following the repression of the demonstration of
    June 20, 1981, which protested the parliament s impeachment of President
    Banisadr and the Islamic Republic s systematic policy of excluding the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization from the country s political scene, and the
    mass executions that followed the demonstration, the MKO turned to armed
    opposition to the regime of the Islamic Republic. The MKO sought to
    organize demonstrations, in order to attract public support and to
    overthrow the regime. The demonstration of September 27, 1981, was such an
    event in which many of the MKO sympathizers were arrested. According to
    official newspapers, the demonstration resulted in the death of several
    Revolutionary Guards, supporters of the MKO, and some bystanders, as well.
    Two days later, the Kayhan newspaper announced the execution of 54
    demonstrators. Trial No information is available on Mr. Derakhshi s trial.
    According to the communiqu issued by the Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s
    Office of the Islamic Republic, the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    collectively condemned Mr. Derakhshi and 42 others to death. Charges
    According to the communiqu , the charges against Mr. Derakhshi were
    participation in a clash at Mobarezan Street; rioting; incitement of
    prisoners; membership in [an anti-regime] organization; and acts against
    the Islamic Republic. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the communiqu ,
    Mr. Derakhshi and 42 other individuals confessed to their charges, and
    some evidence does exist in their cases. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
