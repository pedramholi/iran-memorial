    News of the execution of Mr. Ruhollah Teymuri, son of Aqar, along with
    fourteen others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August
    31, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor
    s Office announced these executions, the defendants' names and their
    charges, and released it to the press. Mr. Ruhollah Teymuri is one of the
    430 individuals whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr. Ruhollah
    Teymuri is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to the announcement, the charges against Mr. Ruhollah Teymuri
    were announced as, "a) Being in charge of the Publication and Distribution
    Committee for Internal Publications under cover of two lithographic
    companies called Azar and Technofine, b) Armed robbery from Melli Bank in
    Salsabil and stealing the workers' salaries in General Motors in Karaj, c)
    Frequenting the organization's houses in order to plan for assassinations
    and overthrow of the Islamic Republic." Also, there were charges shared by
    five defendants such as, "they worked underground and served full-time for
    the hellish organization and received salaries." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ruhollah Teymuri's defense. Judgment َThe Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Court identified Mr. Ruhollah Teymuri as "Mohareb (fighter)
    against God and the Prophet, Mofsed (corruptor on Earth), and Baghi
    (rebel)." He was condemned to death and the ruling carried out on August
    29, 1981.
