    Mr. Ebadi had a flashy nickname and had received attention from Tabriz law
    enforcement. The execution of Mr. Ebadollah Ebadi, son of Asadollah, and
    known as Mr. Buick, along with Mr. Safar Ali Eskandari, was announced in
    the Kayhan newspaper on May 5, 1981 and the Enqelab Eslami newspaper on
    May 6. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial other than he was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tabriz. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Ebadi was
    sodomy. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the newspaper reports, the
    evidence against him consisted of his own confessions, and the testimony
    of the witnesses, and a physician. Defense No information is available on
    his defense. Judgment According to Enqelab Eslami , the two individuals
    who had been imprisoned due to one count of manslaughter, were charged
    with the act of sodomy and condemned to death. This incident is also
    reported by Kayhan . Mr. Ebadollah Ebadi, along his co-defendant, was
    executed by a firing squad on May 5, 1981 in Tabriz.
