    The information about Mr. Ali Reza Shah Baba’i has been acquired from an
    interview with an activist of the same political affiliation, who was also
    detained in the same prison in Qa’em Shahr (in the northern province of
    Mazandaran). Mr. Shah Baba’i is also one of the 12028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Mr. Shah Baba’i was born in Mazandaran, he was
    married and had a son. He was affiliated with the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, Minority faction. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly in the
    political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention Mr. Shah
    Baba’i was arrested in Qa’em Shahr on September 1, 1981. No further
