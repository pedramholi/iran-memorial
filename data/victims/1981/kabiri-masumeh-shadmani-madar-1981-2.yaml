    The information about Ms. Ma sumeh Shadmani (Madar Kabiri) has been sent
    to Omid via an electronic form, by an individual who was at the
    interrogation ward of Evin prison at the same time when Ms. Shadmani was
    arrested. This execution was also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) in
    1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Moreover, the execution of Ms. Shadmani, along with that of
    2 others, was announced by the Public Relations of the Central Prosecutor
    s Office in a communiqu published in the Kayhan newspaper on December 28,
    1981. Additional information has been taken from the Bidaran website. Ms.
    Shadmani, a mother of 6, was a housewife and had been a sympathizer of the
    MKO since 1971. She was arrested in 1974, during the previous regime, and
    first condemned to death and then her sentence was commuted to life
    imprisonment. She was released from prison in 1978, at the start of the
    Revolution, along with other political prisoners. After the Revolution,
    she was the MKO s candidate in the first parliamentary election. Her son
    and daughter-in-law, Mr. Hassan Kabiri, and Homa Robubi, were killed in
    defensive armed clashes with the state officials. Ms. Shadmani was a
    well-known figure affiliated with the MKO. Arrest and detention Ms.
    Shadmani was arrested in October/November 1981 and taken to Evin prison.
    Prison guards and interrogators happily announced her arrest to the
    prisoners, hoping to discourage them. Ms. Shadmani was severely tortured
    in Evin. To escape torture, she attempted to throw herself down the stairs
    from the interrogation room. But the prison guards stopped her. During her
    detention, she was held incommunicado and was denied the right to have an
    attorney. Trial There is no information regarding this trial. Charges
    According to the Public Prosecutor s communiqu , Ms. Shadmani s charges
    were: 1. Being a member of the American Hypocrites Organization [the
    Islamic Regime s name for the MKO]; 2. Being a [parliamentary] candidate
    from the American Hypocrites Organization; 3. Advertising against the
    Islamic Republic s regime; 4. Lending her car and house to the terrorist
    members of this Organization; 5. Instigating riots within the prison 6.
    Armed rebellion against the regime of the Islamic Republic; 7. Leading the
    youth and Muslims astray with her speeches; 8. Aiding the escape of the
    criminals of the Hypocrites Organization; 9. Attempting suicide at the
    Islamic Republic s Central Public Prosecutor s Office, for which she was
    immediately taken to the prison s clinic. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available concerning Ms. Shadmani s
    defense. Judgment Based on the Public Prosecutor s communiqu , Ms.
    Shadmani and 2 other individuals were executed in Evin Prison at dawn, on
    December 27, 1981. However, according to the Mojahed magazine, she died
    under torture.
