    The news of the prosecution and execution of Mr. Hojat Mohseni Kabir and 6
    others was reported by the correspondent of the Kayhan daily in Lahijan on
    July 12, 1981. Mr. Hojat Mohseni Kabir is also one of the 12028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Further information
    about Mr. Mohseni Kabir is taken from the book Our Martyrs in the Path to
    Freedom , copyright 1988 by the Rah-e Kargar Publications. Mr. Kabiri was
    born in Lahijan. In 1976, he was arrested and condemned to five years
    imprisonment for having a connection with a revolutionary group opposed to
    the previous regime. He was released from prison in February 1979 and
    joined the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran-Rah-e Kargar a year
    later. He had an active role in organizing the tea farmers demonstrations
    in Lahijan. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of
    Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded
    by individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They called themselves
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh
    Party, in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Arrest and detention Mr. Mohseni Kabiri was reportedly
    arrested by the Revolutionary Guards in his home on June 18, 1981. He was
    detained at the Revolutionary Guards' prison in Lahijan. Trial According
    to the above book, the defendant was tried in the Revolutionary Guards'
    prison in Lahijan. No other information is available on the defendant s
    trial. Charges According to the Kayhan report, Mr. Mohseni Kabiri was
    charged with, distributing harmful publications, advertising against the
    Islamic Republic, participating in clashes and acting against public
    security, targeting Muslim fighters and revolutionary institutions,
    supplying the license plate numbers of cars belonging to revolutionary
    institutions, leading his comrades in clashes, having direct connections
    to the team houses for leftist American groups. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    According to the newspaper report, the evidence against Mr. Mohseni Kabiri
    was his, explicit confession to being an apostate. There is no information
    regarding any other evidence used against the defendant. International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the
    case of political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised.
    The National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners
    plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their
    political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations
    have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those
    prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available about the
    defendant s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Lahijan
    declared Mr. Hojat Mohseni Kabir a fighter against God and a corruptor on
    earth and sentenced him to death. He was executed by a firing squad in a
    place called the Sheitan Kuh in Lahijan on July 11, 1981.
