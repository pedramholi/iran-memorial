    The execution of Ms. Shohreh Yalfani, daughter of Ali Akbar, and 35 other
    individuals, was announced in a communiqué of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecution Office of the Province of Tehran, as published in the Kayhan
    newspaper on November 26, 1981. Ms. Yalfani is one of the 430 individuals
    whose name appears on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. This execution was also announced in the addendum of the
    Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization
    on September 6, 1985. Ms. Yalfani’s will and additional information has
    been sent to Omid, via an electronic form, by a person familiar with this
    case, whom the Boroumand Foundation has interviewed regarding this case.
    Ms. Yalfani was born in Hamedan in 1958. She was a third year student at
    School of Engineering of Tehran University. She was a student activist and
    a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. After the Revolution, she was
    active in the students’ division of the Organization. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention According to the interviewee, Mr. Yalfani was arrested and
    she and her mother were walking on the street at the end of summer 1981.
    The Revolutionary Guards took her to Evin prison. She was detained for
    around two months during which she had no visits with her family and was
    allowed only one phone call before her execution. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The communiqué of the Central
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office announced that Ms. Yalfani was
    charged with “actively sympathizing with the American small group of
    Peykar.” Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Yalfani’s defense. She was denied an
    attorney as well as access to her own file. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran called Ms. Shohreh Yalfani “an enemy of
    God, a corruptor on earth, and a rebel against the Islamic Revolutionary
    Government of Iran” and condemned her to death in a “religious” verdict.
    Ms. Yalfani was shot by firing squad in Evin prison on November 24, 1981.
    In her will, Ms. Yalfani wrote to her family: “…I love you all very, very
    much; all of you. Please forward my greetings to everyone and kiss them
    for me. In these last moments, I remember your endless kindness. I hope I
    didn’t cause you too much trouble… I wish you success and victory. May God
    protect you. From the one who loved you so much and always kept you in
    mind.”
