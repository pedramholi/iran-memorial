    The news of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Nejati and 37 other
    individuals was announced by a Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s
    Office communiqué published in Kayhan and Jomhouri Eslami newspapers on
    August 8, 1981. This communiqué referred to the executed individuals as
    “blood-thirsty hacks of the American grouplet, the Hypocrites.” Mr.
    Nejati, 25, university student, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded
    in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members’ interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah’s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization’s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Nejati’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial According to the
    Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office communiqué the sentences
    for Mr. Nejati and 37 other defendants were handed down during a one-week
    period. No detailed information is available on Mr. Nejati’s trial.
    Charges Mr. Nejati was charged with “active membership in the Hypocrites
    [Organization] , attacking innocent civilians, and closing [Tehran’s]
    Bazaar during Bani-Sadr’s impeachment.”The Central Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecutor’s Office communiqué also referred to all executed individuals
    as “apostates.” Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Nejati.
    Defense According to the Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office
    communiqué the court heard “the last defenses of the defendants.” There
    is, however, no detailed information available on Mr. Nejati’s defense.
    Judgment The Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Nejati
    to death. He was executed by a firing squad in Tehran’s Evin prison on
    August 7, 1981. Mr. Nejati was 25 at the time of his execution. *The
    exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of their
    centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic
    authorities’ different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between
    the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as
    “Hypocrites” and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
    treatment by governmental officials and the government officials’ efforts
    to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact
    that the regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and
    Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from this
    demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were arrested
    and executed in the following days and weeks. The day after the
    demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a repressive campaign –
    unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and
    sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO
    announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and assassinated
    a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the Islamic regime.
