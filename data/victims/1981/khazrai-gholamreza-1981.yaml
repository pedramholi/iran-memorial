    Mr. Gholamreza Khazra’i (Damghani) is one of the 12,028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Additional information
    about Mr. Khazra’i is taken from the book Our Martyrs in the Path to
    Freedom , copyright 1988 by Rah-e Kargar Publications. He was a
    sympathizer of the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran-Rah-e
    Kargar. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran"
    was established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They identified themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are unknown. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Khazra’i’s
    charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
