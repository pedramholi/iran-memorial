    The execution of Mr. Hossein Me mar Ghafari and five other individuals was
    announced in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (July 5, 1981). The news of this
    execution was followed by a communiqu provided to Pars News Agency by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz. Part of the communiqu reads as
    follows: ... the anti-people organizations have committed a crime
    unprecedented in history. These vile mercenaries, under the guise of
    People's Mojahedin, People s Faqdaiyan of Iran, and Peykar, and in
    connivance with the enemy of this country and following the ominous plans
    of the world-domineering America, have engaged in an armed rebellion
    against the Islamic Republic..." Mr. Me mar Ghafari (Razmandegan) is also
    one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    Razmandegan Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded in the winter of 1979. Its activities were focused on the working
    class and factories. The founding tenets of Razmandegan included the
    rejection of armed struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet
    policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. It viewed the Soviet Union as a
    Social imperialist state and believed thatChinahad deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles. Razmandegan was among the groups that became
    known as Khat-e Se (Third line). By early 1981, disagreements on the Party
    s position on the Iran-Iraq war caused internal splits in Razmandegan.
    These splits, which coincided with the massive and brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government, caused the Organization to disband.
