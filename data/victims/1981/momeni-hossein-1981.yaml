    he joined the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran, Rah-e Kargar. He
    was active in the writing, distribution and sales of publications in
    Gorgan (today in Golestan province). “Rah-e Kargar” or the “Revolutionary
    Workers Organization of Iran” was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They
    identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini’s leadership. Arrest and detention The
