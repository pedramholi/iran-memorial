    Reference to the execution of Dr. Sirus Roshani Osku'i (also spelled
    "Roshani Usku i"), an anesthesiologist, and seven other members of the
    National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha is in Iran, was made by the
    President of the Central Revolutionary Court in an interview published in
    Kayhan on 20 January 1982 (30 Day 1360). Mr. Roshani is one of the 206
    Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. In addition, a report, The Persecution of the
    Baha i Community of Iran , in The Baha i World, Volume XIX, documents the
    persecutions of the members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran
    and lists the Baha is killed since 1978. More information has been drawn
    from other volumes of the The Baha i World , A Tribute to the Faithful by
    Mah Mehr Gulistanih, The Baha i Question: Iran s Secret Blueprint for the
    Destruction of a Religious Community as well as a report on a press
    conference by the President of the Central Revolutionary Court in Kayhan
    Newspaper Nr. 11488 published on 20 January 1982 (30 Day 1360), and other
    reports provided by the Baha i International Community. Mr. Roshani Osku'i
    was elected a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of the Baha is in
    Tabriz. His job with the Ministry of Health was transferred to Tehran in
    1973, after which point he was appointed to a number of national Baha i
    bodies such as the publications review committee. He also wrote and
    published a few Baha i books and papers [Gulistanih, p. 98]. The Baha is
    in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention Mr. Roshani was arrested
    on 14 December 1981 (23 Azar 1360) following a meeting of the National
    Assembly. The meeting was hosted at the home of a member of the Baha i
    community. After their meeting came to an end, the guests began to leave
    discreetly in order to not draw attention to their gathering, as was often
    the case during the early days of the revolution. A few minutes after he
    and Zhinus Mahmudi left, they were arrested by revolutionary guards who
    had surrounded the house. The guards then entered the house to arrest Mr.
    Roshani, the rest of the members of the National Assembly and the hosts.
    They held Mr. Roshani and everyone else against the wall, blindfolded
    them, all the while shouting and asking about the ninth member of the
    Assembly who was absent from that meeting. They then ordered Mr. Roshani
    and the others to get into specific cars. According to eyewitness reports,
    when asked where they were being taken and at whose order, the guards made
    no response. The group was taken to the building of the National Oil
    Company s Club, which served as Komiteh # 4 in Davudiyeh neighborhood.
    According to reports by two survivors, the morning after his arrest, the
    authorities gathered Mr. Roshani and the nine other Baha is arrested in an
    interrogation room and ordered them to fill out a questionnaire about
    names of Assembly members, relationship of the Baha is to Israel, and the
    amount and location of Baha i funds. The authorities interrogated him
    several times during his detainment. Trial The authorities provided no
    information to Mr. Roshani s family regarding his trial and there are no
    eyewitness reports. However, there is an official document from the
    Central Islamic Revolutionary Chief Prosecutor s Office, dated 28 December
    1981 (7 Azar 1360), indicating that Mr. Roshani was tried along with the
    other seven arre
