    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Mo azzen, son of Abdolhossein, along with 20
    other individuals was announced in a communiqu of the Public Relations
    department of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office and
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on December 30, 1981. The
    communiqu begins with this verse of the Koran: Verily, the hypocrites
    shall be in the lowest depth of the fire [4: 145]. Mr. Mo azen (Mojahedin
    Khalq Iran) is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Mo azen s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial There is no information regarding this
    trial. Charges The personal charge brought against Mr. Mo azen is not
    known. He and 11 other individuals were collectively charged with:
    membership of the military-political division of the Hypocrites,
    participation in several assassinations, causing armed clashes,
    participation in illegal demonstrations and identification of individuals,
    activities in safe houses and houses of corruption, throwing Molotov
    Cocktails and setting buses on fire, causing explosions with gas and
    grenades, possessions and carrying arms. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available concerning Mr. Mo azen s
    defense. Judgment An Islamic Revolutionary tribunal condemned Mr. Ahmad Mo
    azen to death. He and 11 other individuals were executed on December 26,
    1981 in Mashhad. _______________________ *The exclusion of MKO members
    from government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing
    houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the authorities called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981,
    the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and
    assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the
    Islamic regime. In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the im
