    The execution of Ms. Mehri Tarameshlu, daughter of Khodaverdi, along with
    21 other individuals, was announced by the Public Relations section of the
    Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office and published in the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on December 26, 1981. Ms. Tarameshlu is also one
    of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Ms. Tarameshlu was
    affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial, other than she
    was tried at the Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal. Charges The
    personal charges brought against Ms. Tarameshlu are not known. She and 18
    other individuals were collectively charged with: Plotting and rebellion
    against the regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran, participation in armed
    demonstration, including the demonstration of June 20, providing place and
    financing for the Hypocrites [i.e. the Mojahedin Khalq Organization],
    participation in assassinations of the Revolutionary Guards brothers,
    possession of arms and ammunitions, active membership in armed teams of
    the Hypocrites, and living in safe houses. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. The demonstration of June
    20, 1981, took place in protest against the parliament s impeachment of
    President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic s systematic policy of
    excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) from the country s
    political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO
    leaders and his insistence for them to disarm. The MKO had until then
    supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function
    within the framework of the new political system. On June 20, the
    Organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations, in which some of the
    demonstrators were armed, all over the country. These demonstrations,
    which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of
    demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that targeted not only
    the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized as
    official government policy the months-old state harassment and suppression
    of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Ms. Tarameshlu s defense. Judgment
    The Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Ms. Mehri Tarameshlu
    to death. According to the Mojahed magazine, she was executed in Tehran on
    December 25, 1981.
