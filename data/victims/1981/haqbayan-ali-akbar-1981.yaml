    The information about Mr. Ali Akbar Haqbayan, son of Ramezan Ali has been
    sent to Omid via an electronic form, by an individual familiar with this
    case. The execution of Mr. Haqbayan along with his brother, Mohammad
    Hashem, was published in the Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on
    August 12, 1981. Mr. Haqbayan is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Haqbayan was born
    on June 28, 1951 in Amirabad village, in the northern province of
    Mazandaran. He started his political activities when he was a student and
    was consequently expelled from university. But he complained to the
    authorities and it was discovered that he had not participated in student
    demonstration. He was allowed to return to university and in 1975 he
    graduated from Tehran University with a bachelor’s degree in geo-politics.
    After the 1979 revolution, he became a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization and joined the Minority branch when the organization split.
    Mr. Haqbayan taught in high schools in Qa’emshahr (in Mazandaran
    province). Mr. Haqbayan was expelled in the winter of 1980. After his
    execution, the Ministry of Education invited him to serve and having
    failed to report to the Ministry’s office, he was expelled a second time.
    On March 18, 1986, the Committee Investigating Administrative Offenses of
    the Ministry of Education Office of Mazandaran Province, issued a ruling,
    stating that Mr. Haqbayan was dismissed due to his failure to report to
    the Ministry’s office and that “The Committee has received reports
    asserting that Mr. Ali Akbar Haqbayan is an activist of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization and has been active inciting high school students against the
    divine Islamic regime and insulting the authorities of the Islamic
    Republic.” Mr. Haqbayan loved photography. He traveled to different cities
    and took pictures. The sender of the electronic form remembers that Mr.
    Haqbayan “was sensitive and committed. He loved music and poetry. He
    believed in human rights and helped the disadvantaged with a portion of
    his monthly salary. At the same time, he acted hastily and had an
    unbendable and stubborn character. Nevertheless, he accepted some
    criticism of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. Some of Amirabad’s residents
    say that the best years of their lives, were the two years that they lived
    with Ali Akbar and his brother.” One day, Mr. Haqbayan found a wallet with
    some cash on a street in Qa’emshahr. He sat in the same place for a few
    hours until he returned the wallet to a woman who was looking for her
    wallet. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired
    by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America,
    was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and
    was active mainly in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest
    and detention The revolutionary guards of Nur (another city in Mazandaran
    province) surrounded Amirabad village at around 7 p.m. on June 26, 1981.
    The arrested Mr. Haqbayan and his brother without showing them an arrest
    warrant. The guards transferred the two brothers to Nur. The Haqbayan
    family traveled to Nur to visit their sons but the officials did not allow
    them to do so. The two brothers were held incommunicado. Trial Mr.
    Haqbayan was tried on July 8, 1981 at Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Nur. Charges The collective charges against Mr. Haqbayan and his brother
    were announced in the newspaper as “supporting the Peykar Organization,
    continuous activity and participation in confrontations in Amol,
    Qa’emshahr, and Gonbad, propaganda for those groups that were active in
    the incidents in Gonbad and Kordestan, misleading youngsters, and
    animosity against the Islamic Republic based on deception and wrong
    doing.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt At the time of arrest, the revolutionary
    guards searched the Haqbayans’ house and found books and publication of
    the Peykar Organization that belonged to Mohammad Hashem Haqbayan. These
    publications were used as evidence of guilt. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Haqbayan’s defense. The person who sent the electronic
    form, states that Mr. Haqbayan did not participate any confrontations and
    that he was not present in the cities mentioned in the charges at the time
    of such confrontations. Judgment According to the newspape
