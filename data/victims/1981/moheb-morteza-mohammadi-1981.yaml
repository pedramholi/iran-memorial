    News of the execution of Mr. Morteza Mohammadi Moheb, son of Mohammad
    Ebrahim, along with sixty-nine others, was published in the Kayhan
    newspaper on September 5, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the
    Central Public Prosecutor’s Office issued an announcement concerning these
    executions, the defendants' names, and their charges, and released it to
    the news agencies. Mr. Mohammadi Moheb is also one of the 430 individuals
    whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh
    va Peykar. Moreover, his name is mentioned among the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of
    dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    collective charges against Mr. Morteza Mohammadi Moheb were announced as,
    being a "member of the legal committee of the American organization of
    Peykar, organizing underground meetings, plotting against the Islamic
    Republic, and supplying and distributing leaflets and other publications
    of the Peykar Organizational." These charges were the same for four
    sympathizers of Peykar. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohammadi Moheb’s
    defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran identified
    Mr. Mohammadi Moheb as an "enemy of God, a corruptor on earth and a rebel
    against the Islamic Regime" and condemned him to death. He was shot by
    firing squad in Evin prison on September 1, 1981.
