    News of the execution of Mr. Abdorrahim Ra’isi, along with thirteen
    others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on July 20, 1981,
    and on July 19, 1981(along with five others). The Revolutionary and Public
    Prosecutor’s Office in Zahedan issued an announcement about this execution
    and released it to the media. Mr. Ra’isi is one of the 430 individuals
    whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh
    va Peykar. Mr. Ra’isi is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Ra’isi was a student in the
    Zahedan Teacher’s College. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Mr. Ra’isi was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Sistan
    and Baluchestan. No further detail is available. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Ra’isi were “membership in the Peykar Organization and
    continuous cooperation with this organization, establishing a team house
    and turning it over to the members of this organization, performing
    continuous assignments between Tehran and Zahedan, having a record of
    rioting and resistance against the Moslem people during the Cultural and
    University Revolution, and apostasy.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The newspaper reported
    that Mr. Ra’isi had “confessed to the charges considering the content of
    the indictment” during the trial. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Ra’isi's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Zahedan identified Mr. Ra’isi as a "corruptor on
    earth, rebel, enemy of God, and apostate." He was condemned to death. He
    was executed on July 18, 1981. He was 25 years old.
