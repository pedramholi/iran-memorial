    The information about Mr. Baqer Monshi Rudsari has been drawn from an

    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Mr. Monshi Rudsari was born in Bibalan village near
    Rudsar in Gilan province. At the time of arrest he was 17 years old and a
    high school student. He was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. He was not underground and was not armed, and his relative
    believes that he was not involved in the Organizational activities. Before
    arrest, he lived in his aunt s house, who looked after him and prevented
    him from leaving the house, fearing he would be arrested if he did. One of

    Rudsari was charged with attacking the Basijis of Bibalan . The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence
    presented against the accused. Defense No information is available
    concerning Monshi Rudari s defense. He was charged with attacking the
    Basijis of Bibalan, although the authorities later attributed the same

    its members. Judgment No specific information is available about the
    verdict leading to this execution. Mr. Baqer Monshi Rudsari was shot by a
    firing squad on September 23, 1981 ( Mojahed magazine). The authorities
    returned his body, covered in blood, to the family for interment, who
    buried him in Amir Bandeh cemetery in Bibalan.
