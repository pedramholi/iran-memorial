    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Qoli Osku i, son of Ahmad, and 34
    other individuals, was published in Kayhan Daily newspaper on Monday, 28
    September 1981, quoting the announcement of the Office of Public Relations
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office. The names and
    crimes of the accused have been stated in this announcement. Mr. Osku i is
    also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Based on
    available information, Mr. Osku i was a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Osku i s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. According to the announcement of the Office of Public
    Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office, the
    Tabriz Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal issued the decision in the case of
    Mr. Osku i and 34 other individuals. Charges The Office of Public
    Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office has
    stated the charges brought against Mr. Mohammad Qoli Osku i and 27 others
    as being working with and being actively connected to the Monafeqin
    (derogatory terms used by the Islamic Republic to describe the MKO)
    organization, taking part in living in safe houses, procurement and
    possession of prohibited arms and explosive materials, participation in
    street demonstrations and skirmishes, approval and acceptance of Monafeqin
    s position of adopting armed struggle, devising plans of terror and
    spreading fear and insecurity among the engaged Moslem people [of Iran],
    plotting rising against the Islamic Republic. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Osku i. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Osku i s defense. Judgment The Tabriz Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal sentenced Mr. Mohammad Qoli Osku i to death. The sentence was
    carried out between Wednesday, 23 September, and Friday, 25 September
    1981, in [the city of] Tabriz and he was shot by a firing squad.
    _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
