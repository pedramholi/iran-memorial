    Mr. Sa'id Bazargan is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June, 1981
    to the publication date of the magazine. Additional information about Mr.
    Bazargan is taken from the book Our Martyrs in the Path to Freedom by
    Rah-e Kargar publication, copyright 1988. He was born in the village of
    Ba'abadaran close to Esfahan. He was a university student and a worker for
    Tavanir in Esfahan. During the revolution, he founded the Independent
    Council of Tavanir Employees in Esfahan. He played an active role in
    organizing the worker strikes against this company. (Tavanir is an
    electrical generating company. It has been said that when he was executed,
    the workers of Tavanir cut the power in parts of the city as a sign of
    respect for him.) After the 1979 Revolution, he joined the Rah-e Kargar
    Organization. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of
    Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded
    by individuals from various leftist groups who believed in political
    action but had rejected the idea of armed struggle. They called themselves
    as Marxist-Leninists, wanting to promote a socialist revolution and the
    leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist
    party, Tudeh, in that they opposed both the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah
    Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown. According to the Rah-e
    Kargar book, Mr. Bazargan was arrested on September 5, 1981. He was
    transferred to the Committee Prison in Esfahan. He was reportedly tortured
    severely. Some prisoners reported seeing his bruised and bloodied body on
    a stretcher. He was denied access to an attorney and visitation with his
    family. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges No information is available on Mr. Bazargan’s charges. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defence No information is available about
    the defendant’s defence. Judgment No specific information is available
    about the defendant’s execution. Mr. Bazargan was executed by a firing
    squad in Esfahan in December 3, 1981.
