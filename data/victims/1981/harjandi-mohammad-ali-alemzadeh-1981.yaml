    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammadali Alemzadeh-Harjandi, along with
    another person, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on July 7,
    1981, quoting the announcement by the Central Public and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor s Office of the Islamic Republic. Mr. Mohammadali
    Alemzadeh-Harjandi is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. According to this source, Mr.
    Mohammadali Alemzadeh-Harjandi was a student, married, and a sympathizer
    of the Nabard Group. Arrest and detention There is no specific information
    on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Tehran tried Mr. Mohammadali Alemzadeh-Harjandi, but no
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Mohammadali Alemzadeh-Harjandi were announced as, being a
    leader of the communist group of Nabard, being the contact person of this
    group with Komoleh, participation in a team house, planning to overthrow
    the Islamic Republic, possessing a forged ID with the name of Hossein
    Yadegari, participation in armed robberies from a bank and a jeweler, and
    apostate. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of

    defendant was announced as, recovery of many weapons and ammunition in a
    team house. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohammadali
    Alemzadeh-Harjandi's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Tehran identified Mr. Mohammadali Alemzadeh-Harjandi as "Mofsed (corruptor
    on Earth), Baghi (rebel), and Mohareb (fighter) against God." He was
    condemned to death. The ruling was carried out when he was executed by
    firing squad in the Evin prison yard on June 21, 1981. News of his
    execution was announced two weeks later. According to the report, because
    he was apostate and anti-religious, his body was transferred to the
    non-Moslem cemetery without washing and shroud. No specific information is
    available about the defendant s execution. Mr. Mohammadali
    Alemzadeh-Harjandi was 31 years old.
