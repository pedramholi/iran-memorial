    Information about Mr. Sadeq Okhovat has been drawn from an interview with
    a relative. Some information was sent to Omid by a relative. News of this
    execution and those of 14 other individuals were announced by the Public
    Relations Section of the Prosecutor s office and published in the Kayhan
    newspaper on July 22, 1981. Mr. Okhovat is also one of the 559 individuals
    whose name appears on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. Additionally, this execution was also announced in the addendum
    of the Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Okhovat, 24, was engaged. He was
    quiet and shy. A smile on the lips was one of his characteristics. He was
    a laborer and a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. He was a resident
    of his birth-place, Esfahan, but a short time prior to his arrest, the
    Organization asked him to relocate to Tehran, in order to be active in the
    publication section of the Organization. He and a few others published
    leaflets and other pamphlets in a house in Tehran. The Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of
    dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third Line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Okhovat was arrested in a house in Tehran where the publications of
    the Peykar Organization were produced. He was sent to Evin Prison and
    interrogated at the Prosecutor s Office there. The details of his arrest
    and detention are not known. He was detained for only 9 days, during which
    he was kept incommunicado. Trial No information is available concerning
    Mr. Okhovat s trial. Charges The Public Prosecutor s Office did not
    release the charges brought against Mr. Sadeq Okhovat to the media.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Okhovat. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Okhovat s defense. Judgment In
    accordance with the verdict of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal,
    Mr. Sadeq Okhovat, along with 14 others, was executed by a firing squad in
    the Evin prison in Tehran on July 22, 1981. The executed bodies were
    transferred to the coroner s office. Mr. Okhovat is buried in Khavaran
    cemetery.
