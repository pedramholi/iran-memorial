    The execution of Mr. Ramezan Ali Noruzi, son of Nurmohammad, was announced
    in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on October 29, 1981. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial other than he
    was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashad. Charges Mr.
    Noruzi was charged with “the despicable act of homosexual rape”. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution refers to “repeated and express confessions
    of the accused”. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on his defense. Judgment In accordance with
    the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashad, Mr. Ramezan Ali Noruzi was
    executed on October 28, 1981.
