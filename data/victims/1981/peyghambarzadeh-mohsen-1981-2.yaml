    News of the execution of Mr. Mohsen Peyghambarzadeh, son of Hossein, along
    with eleven others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on September 19,
    1981. The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qom announced these executions,
    the defendants' names and their charges, and released this to the media.
    Mr. Mohsen Peyghambarzadeh is one of the 430 individuals whose names
    appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va
    Peykar. He is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. A memorial, including his biography,
    was written for Mr. Peyghambarzadeh in the Prison Book, Volume 2, edited
    by Naser Mohajer. Mr. Peyghambarzadeh was born in Qom on January 28, 1964.
    He was the fifth child and very kind. He was a good student in high
    school, with talent in literature and poetry. His activities in Qom
    included distribution of political pamphlets, writing political slogans on
    walls, creating wall newspapers, and connecting with impoverished people,
    especially with the workers of brick factories. Another activity of Mohsen
    and his comrades was to be active among the war victims who resided in
    Qom. He organized most of his activities spontaneously with the support of
    his friends and had minimal contact with the student organization of
    Peykar in Tehran. On September 11, 1981, Ayatollah Meshkini announced the
    ruling of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qom during the Friday prayer
    ceremony and named Mr. Peyghambarzadeh, along with eleven others, as those
    who were executed. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to the Prison Book, Volume 2, Mr. Peyghambarzadeh, along with
    his parents, left town after the widespread attack on opponents of the
    regime began in June of 1981. As soon as he returned, on September 4, he
    was arrested by the local Revolutionary Guards and Basijis. He was
    detained only seven days. The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qom
    announced the charges against Mr. Peyghambarzadeh as "membership in the
    Central Cell of Peykar in Qom, extensive activity to mislead ignorant
    youth, and uprising against the Islamic Republic of Iran”. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Peyghambarzadeh’s defense. Judgment َThe Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Qom identified Mr. Peyghambarzadeh as "corruptor on
    earth, an enemy God and the prophet, and a rebel against the Islamic
    Regime." According to the Prison Book, Volume 2, he was executed by firing
    squad on September 10 or 11, 1981. His body was not delivered to his
    family and he was not buried in the Moslem cemetery because of him being a
    non-believer.
