    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan (Shahram) Hosseinkhani is based on an
    electronic form sent to Omid by a person familiar with his case. Mr.
    Hosseinkhani is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    Mojahed magazine (No. 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the

    born and resided in Kermanshah. He was single, a high school graduate, and
    a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Guerilla Organization. The Fadaiyan
    Khalq Guerilla Organization, a Marxist-Leninist group inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, this organization, which had renounced
    armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of
    the Soviet Union. A number of the organization s members, who did not
    renounce armed struggle, founded the group The Fadaiyan Khalq Guerillas
    (Ashraf Dehqan Branch). Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Hosseinkhani s arrest and detention are not known. According to the
    information sent to Omid, he was arrested along with his brother in

    in Kermanshah. His brother was released after two years. He was denied
    access to an attorney. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Hosseinkhani s trial. Charges According to the electronic form, the charge
    against Mr. Hosseinkhani was declared as, having a weapon. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Hosseinkhani. Defense No information is
    available about Mr. Hosseinkhani s defense. Judgment According to the
    information sent to Omid, Mr. Hassan (Shahram) Hosseinkhani was executed
    by firing squad in Kermanshah in 1981. According to the Mojahed magazine,
