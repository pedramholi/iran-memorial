    The information about Mr. Mahmud Falahat is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism by Rah-e Kargar Publications. Mr. Mahmud
    Falahat (Mojahedin Khalq Iran) is also one of the 12028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. He was born in Shiraz, and a graduate of Tabriz
    University. He became a teacher at the Sa'di High School in Mameqan
    (Azarbaijan Sharqi province). He was so popular that when the authorities
    wanted to fire him from the high school, the students and their families
    demonstrated in his favor and the officials had to back off. He was,
    first, a sympathizer of the Fedaiyan Khalq until a few months after the
    Revolution, when he joined the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran,
    Rah-e Kargar. While teaching in a high school, he worked at the
    underground publishing house of the Organization. His 19 year old sister,
    Maryam Falahat, who was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization,
    was also executed in Shiraz on December 27, 1982. "Rah-e Kargar" or the
    "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the summer
    of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist
    groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political
    action. They identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a
    socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed
    with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the
    Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention
