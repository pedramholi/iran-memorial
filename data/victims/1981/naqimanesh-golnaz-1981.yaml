    News of the execution of Ms. Golnaz Naqibmanesh, along with sixteen
    others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on December 22, 1981. The
    Army Public Prosecutor s Office announced these executions, the
    defendants' names and their charges, and released this to the media.
    Additional information has been drawn from the indictment of other
    individuals who were also involved in the Nojeh coup, as published in the
    Jomhuri Eslami and Enqelab Esmali newspapers on July 20, 1980. According
    to available information, the planners of the Nojeh coup were members of
    the armed forces and the Iran Party (social democrats and part of the
    Iranian National Front) who opposed the religious rule and believed in the
    separation of church and state. The core of the coup d tat plan was to fly
    aircraft from Nojeh base in Hamedan and bomb some military targets as well
    as the residence of Ayatollah Khomeini. Another team was to take over the
    radio-television building in Tehran in order to announce the coup and
    expose the motives to the population. Some Bakhtiari tribes were also
    participating in this coup. The Nojeh coup d tat plan was betrayed a few
    hours before being carried out. On July 9, 1980, the Islamic Republic of
    Iran authorities announced the discovering and dismantling of a civil and
    military network which had planned the coup d tat to overthrow the regime.
    Two months later, the organization Neghab, in a communiqu , claimed
    responsibility for this attempted uprising. The Organization attested that
    the path of Mossadegh is that of the people and today Bakhtiar is its
    authentic leader We have risen up to put an end to this curse [the Islamic
    regime] and to entrust the affairs of our land to the faithful disciple of
    Mossadegh Shapur Bakhtiar (Iran: In Defense of Human Rights, National
    Movement of the Iranian Resistance, Paris, 1983). Following the discovery
    of the plan for the coup, more than sixty officers and civilians were
    executed in several cities of Iran in less than a month. Most of the
    officers were still active in the army and had not been swept away in the
    first wave of purges which took place in the army after the fall of the
    monarchy. Executions of individuals involved in the Nojeh coup continued
    in the months and years to come; at least 200 persons were executed in
    connection with the coup. Nureddin Kianuri, Secretary General of the Tudeh
    Party (the Iranian pro-Soviet communist party) mentioned the coup d tat in
    an article, dated May 2, 2000, posted on the Rah-e Tudeh website. Kianuri
    stressed the fact that the military branch of the Tudeh Party, which
    cooperated with the Islamic Republic s authorities, discovered and
    neutralized the above mentioned organization as well as other groups that
    planned a coup against the newly established regime. Arrest and detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention.
    Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran Army tried Ms. Golnaz
    Naqibmanesh. No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    The charges against Ms. Golnaz Naqibmanesh were announced as, having an
    illegitimate relationship with a member of the network, according to her
    own clear confession, and having an eleven-month illegitimate baby. She
    had intimate involvement with an active member of the network in making
    bombs and placing them in various locations. In an indictment dated July
    19, 1980, the Public Prosecutor noted that those who planned the alleged
    coup d tat were supporters of the Shah and of the American imperialism who
    wanted to: bring about American social democracy and after two years of
    curfew and absolute oppression, put the monarchical system on referendum (
    Jomhuri Eslami , July 20, 1980) The Public Prosecutor emphasized: This
    conspiracy was not planned in a vacuum and hence cannot be described in a
    single indictment; and these conspirators cannot be considered ordinary
    convicts. They are criminals who have undermined the newly regained truth,
    honor, and dignity of a liberated community of Muslim people. Considering
    this, and consulting verses of the holy Quran regarding the punishment of
    a rebel against the Islamic sovereign, it is imperative that the convicts
    receive their punishment according to the Shari a law. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against the defendants. Defense No information is
    available on Ms. Golnaz Naqibmanesh's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tehran Army identified Ms. Golnaz Naqibmanesh as
    "Mofsed (corruptor on Earth) and Mohareb (fighter) against God." She was
    condemned to death. The ruling was carried out when she was executed by
    firing squad in Sanandaj on December 21, 1981. No specific information is
    available about the defendant s execution.
