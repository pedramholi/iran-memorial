    The information about Mr. Karim Javidi, son of Kazem, is based on an
    interview with a person close to him. Mr. Karim Javidi was born in Zanjan
    on October 26, 1955. He was a medical student at Tabriz University and an
    intern at several Tabriz hospitals. He was a member of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class and a leader in the
    student movement in Tabriz during the Revolution. According to his
    relatives, he was in charge of a medical team sent to Kordestan. He cared
    for the injured Kordish militia men ( peshmerga ) and sometimes
    hospitalized them in Tabriz. This execution was announced in the Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper on August 12, 1981, as well as in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization on
    September 6, 1985. He was also one is one of the 430 individuals whose
    name appears on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention Mr. Karim Javidi was arrested during the
    siege of Tabriz University dormitory and arresting of the leftist
    activists on January 19, 1981. According to the interviewee, he was
    detained at Tabriz prison. He was denied the right to have an attorney.
    His first visitation with his family took place 20 days after his arrest.
    Trial The Revolutionary Court of Tabriz tried Mr. Karim Javidi on August
    10, 1981. Mr. Karimi has written in his will, published by the Peykar
    Organization, that he was prosecuted along with his eight other comrades
    and a member of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization by the religious judge.
    Four individuals were tried in only a few minutes and the trial of the
    other 5 persons was delayed until the next day. The judge called them “at
    war with God” and condemned them to death if they refused to collaborate
    with the authorities. Mr. Javidi emphasized in his will that the verdict
    was predetermined before the trial. Charges According to the interviewee,
    the charges against Mr. Karim Javidi were announced as “activity in the
    atheist group of Peykar, which is at war with God” and “medical aid [to
    militia men] in Kordestan”. Collective charges brought against him and 4
    other individuals, as announced in Jomhuri Eslami were as follows: “Armed
    rebellion against the Islamic Republic of Iran and active membership in
    the American group of Peykar, publication, duplication, and distribution
    of leaflets of the said Organization, formation of cells and groups for
    the overthrow of the Islamic Republic, and being in charge of
    organizational facilities of Peykar in Eastern Azarbaijan”. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available about his defense. Mr. Javidi was proud of his
    political convictions and resistance against oppression in prison.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz called Mr. Karim
    Javidi “an apostate who is at war with God and his prophet” and condemned
    him to death. He was executed by firing squad in the Tabriz prison on
    August 12, 1981. Mr. Javidi wrote in his will: “I salute my mother, who
    had to face much hardship in my up-bringing. I ask her to consider all
    children of the Revolution and martyred Communists as her own. I send my
    greetings to all my friends and relatives, and hope that they will
    continue our struggle.”
