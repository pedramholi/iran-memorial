    The news of the execution of Ms. Fariba Sahfi'i Shilakajani, along with
    that of 60 others, was released by the Public Relations of the General
    Prosecutor's Office in a communiqué published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily
    on October 6, 1981. The communiqué, which specifies that those executed
    were “members and sympathizers of the anti-people groups who had risen
    against Islam and the Qur'an”, begins as follows: “By purging the
    corruptors, clean the earth from corruption (Qur'an Karim). Those who have
    not embraced faith and are combating in an idolatrous path are forming
    rank against pious people, and, by martyring the best and purest men, are
    attesting to the fact that they are mercenaries of the great powers. It is
    the duty of you pious men to stand up against them and uproot infidelity
    and hypocrisy.” Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges There is no mention of the charges brought
    against this defendant. The General Prosecutor's Office does, however,
    provide specific charges against one of the 61 individuals named in the
    communiqué: "It must be noted that Mohammad Kazem Golzadeh Ghafuri was
    directly involved in the attack against the Majlis [parliament] during
    which he had opened fire on the revolutionary guards in charge of the
    Majlis shuraye Eslami. He was an active member of the military teams of
    the Monafeqin [Hypocrites, term used by the Islamic Republic authorities
    when referring to the People’s Mojaheddin Organization] and had also a
    role in the unsuccessful assassination attempt on Mr. Hojatolesalm
    Khaz'ali and Hojatoleslam Musavi Tabrizi, the General Prosecutor of the
    Revolution." The communiqué notes that all the other defendants were
    members and sympathizers of groups that it does not identify but refers to
    as “anti-people groups.” The charges against these groups, as specified in
    the communiqué, are as follows: " [rising] against Islam and the Qur'an by
    participating in armed demonstrations and clashes with the Revolutionary
    Guards, imposing martyrdom on people who are faithful to the revolution,
    being present in safe houses, identifying and assassinating known clerics
    and state dignitaries, carrying arms and grenades to oppose defenseless
    people, taking action in order to blow up various centers, and being
    involved in armed carjacking and bank robberies." Evidence of guilt The
    statement issued by the Prosecutor’s Office does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on the accused’s defense. Judgment Based on the
    Public Prosecutor’s Office communiqué, the defendant was sentenced to
    death for being “rebellious against Islam”, “an enemy of God”, and “a
    corruptor on earth.” The sentence was carried out at dawn in the courtyard
    of the Prison.
