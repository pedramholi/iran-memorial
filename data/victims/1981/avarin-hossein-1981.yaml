    Afghanistan, along with two other individuals was announced in the Kayhan
    newspaper on June 27, 1981. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this

    available on the defendant’s trial other than that he was tried at the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kermanshah. Charges There is no exact
    information on the personal charges brought against Mr. Avarin. The news
    story mentions the collective charge against him and two other individuals
    as “adultery, sodomy, and counter-Revolutionary activities.” The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.

    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Avarin’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Kermanshah condemned Mr. Hossein Avarin to death. He was
    executed on June 25, 1981 at Dizel Abad prison.
