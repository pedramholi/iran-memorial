    The news of the execution of Mr. Naser Chazani, along with that of 60
    others, was released by the Public Relations of the General Prosecutor's
    Office in a communiqué published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on October 6,
    1981. The communiqué, which specifies that those executed were “members
    and sympathizers of the anti-people groups who had risen against Islam and
    the Qur'an”, begins as follows: “By purging the corruptors, clean the
    earth from corruption (Qur'an Karim). Those who have not embraced faith
    and are combating in an idolatrous path are forming rank against pious
    people, and, by martyring the best and purest men, are attesting to the
    fact that they are mercenaries of the great powers. It is the duty of you
    pious men to stand up against them and uproot infidelity and hypocrisy.”
    Furthermore, Mr. Naser Chazani (a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization) is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges There is no mention of the charges brought
    against this defendant. The General Prosecutor's Office does, however,
    provide specific charges against one of the 61 individuals named in the
    communiqué: "It must be noted that Mohammad Kazem Golzadeh Ghafuri was
    directly involved in the attack against the Majlis [parliament] during
    which he had opened fire on the revolutionary guards in charge of the
    Majlis shuraye Eslami. He was an active member of the military teams of
    the Monafeqin [Hypocrites, term used by the Islamic Republic authorities
    when referring to the People’s Mojahedin Organization] and had also a role
    in the unsuccessful assassination attempt on Mr. Hojatoleslam Khaz'ali and
    Hojatoleslam Musavi Tabrizi, the General Prosecutor of the Revolution."
    The communiqué notes that all the other defendants were members and
    sympathizers of groups that it does not identify but refers to as
    “anti-people groups.” The charges against these groups, as specified in
    the communiqué, are as follows: " [rising] against Islam and the Qur'an by
    participating in armed demonstrations and clashes with the Revolutionary
    Guards, imposing martyrdom on people who are faithful to the revolution,
    being present in safe houses, identifying and assassinating known clerics
    and state dignitaries, carrying arms and grenades to oppose defenseless
    people, taking action in order to blow up various centers, and being
    involved in armed carjacking and bank robberies." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    statement issued by the Prosecutor’s Office does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Chazani’s defense. Judgment Based on the
    Public Prosecutor’s Office communiqué, the defendant was sentenced to
    death for being “rebellious against Islam”, “an enemy of God”, and “a
    corruptor on earth.” The sentence was carried out at dawn in the courtyard
    of the Prison.
