    The execution of Mr. Abdolmajid (or Abdolhamid) Ja fari Ziarati, son of
    Asadollah, along with fourteen other individuals, was announced in a
    communiqu of the Public Relations Department of the Central Public
    Prosecutor s Office and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    August 31, 1981. Mr. Ja fari Ziarati is one of the 430 individuals whose
    names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh va
    Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the organization
    who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on
    this list have been executed. Mr. Abdolmajid Ja fari Ziarati is also one
    of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6,
    1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. The communiqu of the Public Relations Department of the Central
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s Office states: Hail to the fighters of
    the war against the world infidels under the leadership of blood-thirsty
    America, and hail to the heroic and martyr-producing nation, which
    obstruct criminals and merciless Hypocrites, and which reports these
    criminals against the Koran and Islam to the armed forces and the
    judiciary on a daily basis, and which accepts the calling of the Koran
    that O Prophet, strive hard against the unbelievers and the Hypocrites,
    and be firm against them [9: 73]. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges In the
    communiqu of the Public Relations Department of the Central Revolutionary
    Public Prosecutor s Office, the collective charges against Mr. Ja fari
    Ziarati and 5 other individuals were announced as: a) Being in charge of
    the Publication and Distribution Committee for internal use [in the Peykar
    Organization] under the cover of two lithographic companies called Azar
    and Technofine;b) Armed robbery from Melli Bank on Salsabil [street in
    Tehran, renamed Rudaki Street] and stealing the salaries in of the
    employees of General Motors in Karaj;c) Living in safe-houses in order to
    plan for assassinations and overthrow of the Islamic Republic. Moreover,
    fifteen defendants including Mr. Khoshnam, were charged with working
    full-time, professionally, and secretively for the hellish Organization
    and received salary. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ja fari Ziarati s
    defense. Judgment The Central Islamic Revolutionary Court called Mr.
    Abdolmajid Ja fari Ziarati at war with God, corruptor on earth and a rebel
    and condemned him to death. He was shot by a firing squad on August 29,
    1981.
