    The news of the execution of Mr. Reza’i and 13 other individuals was
    announced in a communiqué by the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office
    published in Kayhan and Jomhouri Eslami newspapers on August 25, 1981. In
    this communiqué the executed individuals are referred to as “hacks of the
    criminal U.S. imperialism.” Mr. Hamid Reza’i, 23, and a supporter of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded
    in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members’ interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah’s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization’s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Reza’i’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on Mr. Reza’i’s trial. Charges According to the Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office communiqué , Mr. Reza’i and 13 other
    individuals were charged with “rebelling against the Islamic Republic”. In
    addition, this communiqué announced the following charges specifically
    against Mr. Reza’i: “Living in safe houses, active participation in
    scattered demonstrations from June 15 to June 30, providing Molotov
    cocktails, hand-made grenades and financial assistance towards the evil
    goals of the Hypocrites Organization, ordering and involvement in
    bombings, and gathering information for acts of destruction.” . Evidence
    of guilt The report of this execution does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Reza’i Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Reza’i’s defense. Judgment The Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal found Mr. Reza’i guilty of waging war on God and
    the Prophet, corruption on earth, and rebellion, and sentenced him to
    death. Mr. Reza’i was executed by a firing squad on August 23, 1981. Mr.
    Reza’i was 23 years old at the time of his execution. .
    _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities’ different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as “Hypocrites” and the
    Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers
    regularly during demonstrations and while distributing publications,
    leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO
    called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental
    officials and the government officials’ efforts to impeach their ally,
    President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called
    this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom
    confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of
    casualties that resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large
    number of demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days
    and weeks. The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime
    started a repressive campaign – unprecedented in modern Iranian history.
    Thousands of MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On
    June 21, 1981, the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic
    Republic and assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and
    supporters of the Islamic regime. I
