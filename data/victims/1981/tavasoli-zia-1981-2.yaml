    News of the execution and information about Mr. Zia Tavasoli, son of
    Mahmud, was sent to Omid via electronic forms and emails by a person close
    to him. According to this information, he was born in Nur, Mazandaran, in
    1954. After he completed his fifth grade education, he moved to Tehran and
    start working as a worker in a metal workshop. In 1973, he was introduced
    to political activism and the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. During the
    pre-revolutionary demonstrations, he was active and joined the Tohid
    Association connected to the Mojahedin Organization, and he participated
    in meetings and demonstrations of this group until June 20, 1981 when he
    went underground. He was married and kept his connection with his wife
    during this period. According to people close to him, Mr. Tavasoli was a
    kind and affable man. Mr. Tavasoli is one of the 12,028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No. 261) as a sympathizer of this
    organization, published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic s
    leaders. * Arrest and detention According to the electronic form report,
    Mr. Tavasoli was arrested in Tehran on November 22, 1981. On this day he
    told his wife that he was going on a rendezvous. According to his family,
    Mr. Tavasoli s cousin had seen him around Sabalan Street and reported him.
    When his mother and his wife went to the Evin Prison, authorities did not
    inform them. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Tavasoli s trial. Charges
    According to the electronic form report, the charge brought against Mr.
    Tavasoli was for his activities for the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    However, no information is available on his official charges. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against Mr. Tavasoli. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Tavasoli s defense. Judgment According to the electronic
    form report, Mr. Zia Tavasoli was executed by firing squad in Evin Prison
    on December 7, 1981. On January 18, 1981, authorities asked Mr. Tavasoli s
    wife to go to the Evin Prison. When she went, they gave her Mr. Tavasoli s
    will and watch and told her that he had been executed on December 7, 1981.
    They also informed her of his burial location. No further information is
    available about his execution. _________________________ * The exclusion
    of MKO members from government offices and the closure of their centers
    and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic
    authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the
    two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites
    and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin
    sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while distributing
    publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20,
    1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by
    governmental officials and the government officials efforts to impeach
    their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the
    authorities called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted t
