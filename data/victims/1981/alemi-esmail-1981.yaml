    The information about Mr. Esma'il Alemi is based on an interview with a
    person close to him, and the addendum to the Mojahed magazine published by
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. Mr. Esma'il Alemi
    was born in Noqrehdasht (in Rasht). He was a high school graduate and a
    member of the Revolutionary Committee in Noqrehdasht. He was not a member
    of the Mojahedin, but, he defended this organization in street discussions
    and argued against the Islamic regime. The first time that he was arrested
    he was beaten severely and, according to him, the officers pulled his
    mustache with pliers. They threatened him in order that he should quit his
    political activities. Revolutionary Committees were local organizations
    established during the revolution in order to police the neighborhoods.
    They consisted of local people, especially the youth who were
    pro-revolutionary. They were dissolved into the Basij and the
    Revolutionary Guards shortly after the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic. Arrest and detention The exact date of Mr. Alemi's second arrest
    is unknown. According to the interviewee, he was arrested in 1981 by the
    Revolutionary Guards and transferred to the Rasht prison. He was executed
    three days later. Trial No information is available on the defendant's
    trial. Charges No information is available on the charges brought against
    Mr. Esma'il Alemi. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available about his defense. Judgment
    Mr. Esma'il Alemi was tried and condemned to death. He was executed by
    firing squad at Rasht prison in 1981. The date of his execution in the
    Mojahed list, however, is August 10, 1982. He was the first revolutionary
    person executed in Rasht. According to the interviewee, the news of his
    execution was announced on Rasht radio and published in the city
    newspaper.
