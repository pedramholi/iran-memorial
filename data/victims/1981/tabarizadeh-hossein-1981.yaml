    The news of the execution of Mr. Hossein Tabarizadeh was announced in
    reports published in Kayhan and Ettela at on July 14, 1981 and in Jomhouri
    Eslami on July 15, 1981. Mr. Tabarizadeh, a supporter of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization, is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded
    in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Tabarizadeh s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Based on
    the available information, the Gorgan Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    issued Mr. Tabarizadeh s sentence. No information is available on Mr.
    Tabarizadeh s trial. Charges According to the Kayhan report Mr.
    Tabarizadeh was charged with actively supporting the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, inciting village-dwellers against the Islamic Republic,
    performing various acts towards advancement of the Organization s evil
    goals, involvement in clashes of the recent days in Gorgan in support of
    the impeached Bani Sadr, spreading rumors and distributing leaflets and
    banned publications in opposition to the Islamic Republic, and believing
    in the political and military positions of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. . Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Tabarizadeh. Defense No information is available on Mr. Tabarizadeh s
    defense. Judgment The Gorgan Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal found Mr.
    Tabarizadeh guilty of waging war on God, corruption on earth, and
    rebellion, and sentenced him to death. Mr. Tabarizadeh was executed by a
    firing squad on July 13, 1981 in Gorgan. _________________________ *The
    exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of their
    centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic
    authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the
    two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites
    and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin
    sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while distributing
    publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20,
    1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by
    governmental officials and the government officials efforts to impeach
    their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the
    regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets,
    some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The
    number of casualties that resulted from this demonstration is unknown but
    a large number of demonstrators were arrested and executed in the
    following days and weeks. The day after the demonstration, the Islamic
    Republic regime started a repressive campaign unprecedented in modern
    Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and sympathizers were arrested
    or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO announced an armed struggle against
    the Islamic Republic and assassinated a number of high-ranking officials
    and supporters of the Islamic regime. In the summer of 1981, the leader of
    the MKO and the impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in
    France, where they foun
