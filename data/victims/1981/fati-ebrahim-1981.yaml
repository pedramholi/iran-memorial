    News of the execution of Mr. Ebrahim Fati, son of Faraj, along with three
    others, was published in the Keyhan newspaper on September 13, 1981. The
    Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor’s Office
    issued an announcement concerning these executions, the defendants' names
    and their charges, and released it to the Pars news agency. Mr. Ebrahim
    Fati is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of
    “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains
    the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Ebrahim Fati were
    announced as, "establishing and frequenting the organizational houses,
    conspiracy against the Revolution and the Islamic Republic of Iran by
    sympathizing with the terrorist and American organization of Peykar, and
    active participation in recent clashes with the Moslem people." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Ebrahim Fati's defense. Judgment َThe
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Masjedsoleiman identified Mr. Ebrahim Fati
    as, "Mofsed (corruptor on Earth) and Mohareb (fighter against God and the
    Prophet)." He was condemned to death. The ruling was carried out on
    September 10, 1981.
