    Information about Mr. Hassan Sarkhosh has been drawn from an electronic
    form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. Ms. Sarkhosh
    is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Based on
    the available information, Mr. Sarkhosh was affiliated with the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. His father, a police officer, was killed in an armed
    struggle with drug smugglers when he was young. His mother raised her four
    children as a single parent with pension of her husband and worked in
    people s houses as a cleaner. Mr. Sarkhosh had two brothers, both of whom
    were executed: Mohsen was shot by a firing squad less than a month before
    Hassan was killed, and Jahanbakhsh was hanged in 1988 during the mass
    executions of political prisoners. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Sarkhosh s arrest and detention are not known. Trial There is no
    information regarding this trial. Charges The charges brought against the
    defendant are not known. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense No
    information is available concerning Sarkhosh s defense. Judgment According
    to the Mojahed magazine, Mr. Hassan died under torture on September 28,
    1981. According to a witness, whose testimony has been sent to Omid, when
    his body was returned to his family, one could see that it had been shot.
    The sender of an electronic form quoted this witness saying: when
    [Jahanbakhsh Sarkhosh s] two brothers were executed, Jahan himself washed
    their bodies in [the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in Tehran]. Jahan told me
    that their faces, jaws, and teeth had been shattered by the bullets. Jahan
    s mother was screaming [as if wounded], unlike anything I had ever seen,
    and was saying: How could you do this to me? I raised these kids by doing
    people s laundry. How could you do this to me? I hope you all burn in
    hell. I hope your Imam burns in hell.
