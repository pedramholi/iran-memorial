    News of the execution of Mr. Majidreza Khosravi-Kamrani, along with
    eighteen others, was published in the Keyhan newspaper on August 16, 1981.
    The Public Relations Department of the Central Revolutionary and Public
    Prosecutor’s Office issued an announcement about this execution. Mr.
    Majidreza Khosravi-Kamrani is one of the 430 individuals whose names
    appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va
    Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the Organization
    who died after the Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on
    this list have been executed. According to this report, Mr. Majidreza
    Khosravi-Kamrani, age 21, was a civil engineering student. One of his
    comrades appreciated his effort to save this person by giving a phone
    number to his family before leaving with the agents who arrested him.
    Further information about the execution of Mr. Majidreza Khosravi-Kamrani
    was sent to the Boroumand Foundation through two electronic forms by a
    friend and by an acquaintance. According to these forms, he was a member
    of the Peykar Organization. Mr. Majidreza Khosravi-Kamrani is one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention According to a form sent to Boroumand Foundation, Mr.
    Majidreza Khosravi-Kamrani was arrested in Tehran in 1981 at 1 am. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information
    is available on Mr. Majidreza Khosravi-Kamrani's charges. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Majidreza Khosravi-Kamrani's defense. Judgment According
    to the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization, Mr. Majidreza
    Khosravi-Kamrani was executed by firing squad in the Evin prison on August
    12, 1981. No specific information is available about the defendant’s
    execution.
