    Information regarding the execution of Mr. Seyed Hossein Hosseini Seyedi,
    son of Seyed Ahmad and Dusti Alinejad was provided to the Boroumand
    Foundation through an electronic form by one of his relatives. Mr.
    Hosseini,17, high school student, and a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded
    in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members’ interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah’s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization’s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention According to the
    information provided by his relative, Mr. Hosseini was arrested in July or
    August 1981 when he went to a friend’s house to say good-bye before
    leaving for summer vacation. Mr. Hosseini’s friend and his 12-year-old
    brother had been arrested previously, and their home was being watched.
    Mr. Hosseini was in Evin Prison for about one month. During this time, his
    family searched for him in almost all prisons but couldn’t receive any
    information. Trial No information is available on Mr. Hosseini’s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Hosseini is not known. Evidence of
    guilt According to Mr. Hosseini’s relative, the authorities had told Mr.
    Hosseini’s family that he was in possession of the Mojahed magazine.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Hosseini’s defense. Judgment
    Based on the information provided to the Boroumand Foundation by his
    relative, Mr. Hosseini was executed by a firing squad in Tehran’s Evin
    Prison on August 30 or 31, 1981. His family was not notified before the
    execution, but they were later on told that Mr. Hosseini was buried at
    Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. Mr. Hosseini was 17 years old at the time of his
    execution. _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities’ different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as “Hypocrites” and the
    Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers
    regularly during demonstrations and while distributing publications,
    leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO
    called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental
    officials and the government officials’ efforts to impeach their ally,
    President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called
    this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom
    confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of
    casualties that resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large
    number of demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days
    and weeks. The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime
    started a repressive campaign – unprecedented in modern Iranian history.
    Thousands of MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On
    June 21, 1981, the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic
    Republic and assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and
    supporters of the Islamic regime. * In the summer of 1981, the leader of
    the MKO and the impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in
    France, where th
