    The news of Ms. Tahereh Ostad Ali Me’mar’s execution, and 22 others was
    released in a communiqué of the Public Relations' office of the Islamic
    Republic’s Public Prosecutor’s Central Office. The communiqué was
    published in the Kayhan daily on September 23, 1981. Additional
    information was drawn from electronic forms sent to Omid by a person
    familiar with her case. Furthermore, Ms. Ostad Ali Me’mar is one of the
    1,533 executed prisoners listed by the Association of Iranian Women of
    Köln (Germany). The list published in 1997 is entitled: “A Partial List of
    Women Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran.” This execution was also
    reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by MKO
    in 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June, 1981 to the publication date
    of the magazine. Ms. Ostad Ali Me’mar was a member of the MKO. According
    to the form, she had joined MKO at 16 and was arrested twice before her
    last arrest for distributing pamphlets for the Organization. Arrest and
    detention Based on the available information, Ms. Ostad Ali Me’mar was
    arrested and detained at Evin Prison in Tehran two days before her
    execution. While in detention, she was reportedly asked to publicly
    confess, repenting her past and renouncing her political ideology, but she
    refused. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The
    Kayhan daily mentions that Ms. Ostad Ali Me’mar was tried by the Central
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal. Charges The charges against Ms. Ostad Ali
    Me’mar were announced by the Islamic Republic’s Public Prosecutor’s
    Central Office and published by the Kayhan daily as follows: “Being a
    member of the American hypocrites’ organization (a name commonly used for
    the MKO by the Islamic government), being present in MKO team houses,
    being a member of the armed wing of the MKO, participating in the
    operational teams of the MKO, and possessing a Molotov cocktail.” The
    communiqué writes: "Now, thanks to the victory of the Islamic revolution,
    the world's infidels and apostates are about to be uprooted and the
    oppressed are free from the bonds of the oppressors. With the relentless
    effort of committed Muslims, the world has been shown the real meaning of
    Islam and our Revolution. Under these circumstances, some criminals wanted
    to stop the expansion of the revolution and began to sew the seeds of
    discord trying to harm the cohesion of the ever-present Umma and overthrow
    the Islamic Republic's regime. But, they are unaware that our Umma has
    stood up to these devastations and is now completely determined to destroy
    all corruptors." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt Based on the information sent through
    electronic form, the family has no knowledge of the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense According to the form, the charges of
    possession of Molotov cocktails were false and the authorities trumped up
    the other charges against the defendant in order to get a conviction.
    Judgment Ms. Ostad ‘Ali Me’mar was declared a “corruptor on earth” and an
    “enemy of God” and was sentenced to death. She was executed in the evening
    of September 22, 1981 at Evin Prison.
