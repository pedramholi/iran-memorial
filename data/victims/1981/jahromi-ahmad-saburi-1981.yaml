    Mr. Ahmad Saburi Jahromi is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear
    on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This
    list contains the names of those members of the organization who died
    after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this
    list have been executed. He is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Ahmad Saburi
    Jahromi was an engineer. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges No

    executed in Shiraz in August of 1981.
