    The execution of Mr. Jampur Tahmasbi and 14 other individuals was
    announced in a communiqu of the Public Relations department of the Public
    Prosecution Office and published in the Kayhan newspaper on July 22, 1981.
    He is also one of the 430 individuals whose name appears in the list of
    Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    published on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list contains the names
    of those members of the Organization who died after the Revolution of
    1979. More than 400 of the individuals in this list have been executed.
    Moreover, Mr. Tahmasbi is mentioned in the Peykar magazine (the main
    publication of the Peykar Organization, No. 116, dated August 31, 1981) as
    well as in the addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the
    Mojahedin Khalgh Organization on September 6, 1985. The latter includes
    12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According
    to Peykar , Mr. Tahmasbi was born in 1954 in Malfejan (near Siahkal in
    Gilan province). He earned his bachelor s degree in the School of
    Management of Lahijan (Gilan province). In Gilan and Tehran, he worked in
    the central publication section of the Peykar Organization, and was a
    candidate for the membership of this Organization. The Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of
    dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    Prosecutor s Office did not announce the charges brought against Tahmasbi.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Tahmasebi s defense. Judgment Pursuant
    to the verdict of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal, Mr. Jampur
    Tahmasbi was shot by a firing squad at Evin Prison in Tehran on July 22,
    1981. He was 27 years old. The bodies of the executed individuals were
    transferred to the forensic medical team. According to Peykar , his body
    is buried in Khavaran cemetery.
