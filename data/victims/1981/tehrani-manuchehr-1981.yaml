    News of the execution of Mr. Manuchehr Tehrani, son of Asghar, along with
    five others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on July 8, 1981. The
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Noshahr and Chalus issued an announcement
    concerning these executions, the defendants' names, and their charges, and
    released it to the media. Mr. Manuchehr Tehrani is one of the 430
    individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr. Manuchehr
    Tehrani is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Noshahr and Chalus announced the charges
    against Mr. Manuchehr Tehrani as, “participation in demonstrations for
    overthrowing [the government] and clashes in Gonbad, Siahkal, Langrud, and
    Kordestan, and intense activity against the Islamic Republic regime.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Manuchehr Tehrani's defense. Judgment
    The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Noshahr and Chalus idendified Mr.
    Manuchehr Tehrani as, “Mofsed (corruptor on Earth), Mohareb (fighter), and
    Mortad (apostate).” He was condemned to death. The Supreme Judicial
    Council confirmed the ruling. The ruling was carried out in Noshahr or
    Chalus on July 6, 1981 at night. No specific information is available
    about the defendant’s execution.
