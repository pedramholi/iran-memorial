    Mr. Esma’il Gorgani Zein’ali (Mojahedin Khalq Iran) is one of the 12028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members’
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah’s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization’s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Gorgani Zein’ali’s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Gorgani Zein’ali’s trial.

    No information is available on Mr. Gorgani Zein’ali’s defense. Judgment
    There is no information on the verdict leading to this execution.
    _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities’ different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as “Hypocrites” and the
    Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers
    regularly during demonstrations and while distributing publications,
    leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO
    called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental
    officials and the government officials’ efforts to impeach their ally,
    President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called
    this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom
    confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of
    casualties that resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large
    number of demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days
    and weeks. The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime
    started a repressive campaign – unprecedented in modern Iranian history.
    Thousands of MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On
    June 21, 1981, the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic
    Republic and assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and
    supporters of the Islamic regime. * In the summer of 1981, the leader of
    the MKO and the impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in
    France, where they founded the National Council of Resistance. After the
    MKO leaders and many of its members were expelled from France, they went
    to Iraq and founded the National Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which
    entered Iranian territory a few times during the Iran-Iraq war. They were
    defeated in July 1988 during their last operation, the Forugh Javidan
    Operation. A few days after this operation, thousands of imprisoned
    Mojahedin supporters were killed during the mass executions of political
    prisoners in 1988. Ever since the summer of 1981, the MKO has continued
    its activities outside of Iran. No information is available regarding
    members and activities of the MKO inside the country. In defense: In spite
    of the “armed struggle” announcement by the MKO on June 20, 1981, many
    sympathizers of the organization had no military training, were not armed,
    and did not participate in armed conflict.
