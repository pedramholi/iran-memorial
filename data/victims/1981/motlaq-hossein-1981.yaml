    newspapers on June 15, 1981. Additional information about this case was
    obtained from Ettela at newspaper (June 17, and July 9, 1981); documents
    published on the Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran website including
    his letter to the Shari a judge (February 8, 1981); the last letter of two
    of his co-defendants (June 13, 1981); his letter of introduction; his

    National Spiritual Assembly of the United States Andalib (Winter 1990);
    Iran Wire website (September 7, 2014); the Baha i News videos on a YouTube
    channel (June 11, 2016); Baha is in the Media website (December
    2008-January 2009); Gooya News website (April 28, 2015); and Martyrs of

    Baha i family on January 30, 1936, in the town of Aran, located to the
    north of [the city of] Kashan. He started working in Tehran after
    finishing high school. He moved to the city of Hamedan in the early 1970 s
    in order to promote the Baha i religion, and became a member of the
    Hamedan Spiritual Assembly** in 1977. He was the Assembly s Secretary at
    the time of his arrest. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran, Iran
    Wire). Persons close to Mr. Motlaq describe him as a reputable individual
    with a tender and poetic spirit. He has left a number of poems behind. Mr.
    Motlaq was married, with children. (Baha i News Program). Mr. Motlaq was
    arrested once on July 16, 1979, and was released after 9 days, upon
    posting bail with the Hamedan Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office.
    This case is related to the arrest of 7 members of the Hamedan s Baha i
    Spiritual Assembly in 1980. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    Background The Baha i religious community is the largest minority group in
    Iran, with approximately 300,000 members in 1979 (more current figures are
    not available).*** The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected
    Baha is religious to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them
    of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence. **** Arrest and detention Mr. Motlaq was arrested
    on August 9, or 10, 1980, on an arrest warrant issued by the Revolutionary
    Court, and was temporarily released on August 11, and told to return in
    three days. Before the end of the 3-day period, however, he and several
    other members of the Hamedan Baha i Spiritual Assembly were arrested on
    August 12, or 13, 1980, by members of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    Revolutionary Guards Corps. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran, Iran
    Wire). Mr. Motlaq spent 21 days at the Revolutionary Guards detention
    center and was subsequently transferred to the Police Force prison. He
    endured physical torture during detention. Mr. Motlaq was denied
    visitations for 3 months after his arrest. (Archives of Baha i Persecution
    in Iran). His and his co-defendants cell was located next to the ward
    toilets and was so small that they had to take turns sleeping. According
    to handwritten notes obtained from one of Mr. Motlaq s co-defendants, they
    were incarcerated in a dirty and polluted environment and were deprived of
    the most basic health and hygiene requirements, including showering .
    According to this person, in order to combat lice and other pollutants,
    they used [bleach, detergents,] and heavy duty chemical cleansers multiple
    times a day. (Iran Wire). Mr. Motlaq s and his co-defendants families
    wrote numerous letters to Iran s government officials and judicial
    authorities in order to have them lift their visitation ban. According to
    the families of Mr. Motlaq s co-defendants, the prison guards did not
    allow the prisoners and their families to speak to one another in their
    first visitation. Mr. Motlaq and his ward mates were allowed two
    visitations per week with their families. (Iran Wire). According to the
    spouse of one of Mr. Motlaq s co-defendants, in the first two weeks of
    visitations, only the prisoners children were permitted to visit with
    their fathers; thereafter, their spouses were allowed visitation as well.
    Mr. Motlaq and his co-defendants were kept in the general ward for four
    months and were then transferred to the political prisone
