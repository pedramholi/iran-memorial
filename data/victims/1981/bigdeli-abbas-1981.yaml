    The information about Mr. Abbas Bigdeli, son of Yusef Ali, was provided
    via an electronic form by a person familiar with this case. He was born on
    March 22, 1947 in Tehran. Mr. Bigdeli was a husband and father of three
    children. He was a civilian working for the communications department of
    the Iranian Air Force. He did not have any political affiliation. Based on
    the information available, he was a master at his job and was one of the
    people who set up the communication network for the 2,500 th year
    celebration of the monarchy in Iran in 1971. He loved his family dearly.
    Arrest and detention The evening of September 16, 1981, Mr. Bigdeli
    received a phone call from someone who asked him to report to his
    workplace. At 7 a.m. of the following morning, he went to work at
    Battalion Piruz 77 of the air force in Mashad, and was arrested without
    warrant. He was held in the detention center of the battalion Piruz 77 and
    for one month in Vakil-Abad Prison. He had weekly visits with his family.
    Trial Mr. Bigdeli was tried on October 22, 1981. The trial lasted for
    about 2 hours. The appeals court was held on November 16 and confirmed his
    sentence. His family members were not allowed to attend the trial, and
    only saw him from afar with handcuffs and shackles on his feet. Charges
    Mr. Bigdeli was charged with “adultery.” When his family members went to
    the Joint Committee of the Army in Tehran, they were told that Mr. Bigdeli
    had several charges brought against him, but did not inform them what
    these alleged charges were. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt Based on information
    available, the prosecutor did not have a witness or other evidence.
    Defense No information is available concerning Mr. Bigdeli’s defense. He
    did not have a defense attorney. During visits with his family, he assured
    them that he was innocent and that he would return home soon. The source
    of the information emphasizes that his family members were not allowed to
    attend the trials, they never saw the verdict, and were not even aware of
    the execution until after it was carried out. This person believes that
    these circumstances show that Mr. Bigdeli was innocent. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the verdict leading to this
    execution. Mr. Bigdeli was executed on November 17, 1981. In his will,
    dated November 16, Mr. Bigdeli wrote: “My wife, may God protect you. Take
    care of our kids. I was unfair to you. I hope you forgive me. God is my
    witness; I always loved you… Don’t let our son smoke. Look after the
    kids…” The family members followed up on the case, but the judge refused
    to see them since they were “infidels.”
