    The information about Ms. Jila Fathi has been drawn from an interview with
    a friend of hers who was a former librarian of the Institute for the
    Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults in Kuch-e Esfahan.
    Since adolescence, Ms. Jila Fathi had been introduced to social issues by
    her librarian friend through book readings and collective discussions.
    During the revolution, she participated in anti-monarchy demonstrations.
    After the revolution, she became a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization,
    but she had no organizational connection with them. Kuch-e Esfahan was a
    small town where Peykar was not present as an organization. She was a high
    school student expressing her criticism of the Islamic regime freely at
    school and she advocated the Peykar Organization. Her friend, quoting
    Jila's mother, recalls that she denied herself simple and basic comforts
    in life such as using a pillow in order to understand the situation of
    prisoners. Jila had a talent for, and wrote some poetry. According to her
    cellmates, she always recited a poem in a Gilaki song (Gilaki is a local
    dialect in Northern Iran). The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar no longer existed. Arrest and detention After mass
    arrests began in early summer of 1981, Jila fled Kuch-e Esfahan since
    everyone there knew her in this small town. She went to Tehran without
    having a safe place to stay. She would wander the streets during the day
    and spend the night in her relatives' houses, until she was arrested on
    the street as a suspect in that same summer. She was detained at Evin
    prison. Prison officials did not know anything about her, so they asked
    the Kuch-e Esfahan authorities for a report on her. Ms. Jila Fathi was
    known as a leftist and a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization in that
    town. Her cellmates gave this information to her mother. She had no
    visitation during her detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges No information is available on Ms. Jila Fathi s
    charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available about her defense. Judgment Ms. Jila
    Fathi was executed at Evin prison in 1981. No specific information is
    available about her execution. After her execution, her friend visited
    Jila's mother in the spring of 1982 and saw her will. According to this
    friend, Jila had written a very brief will with the following content: "I
    am Jila Fathi, 19 years old. I have nothing else to say."
