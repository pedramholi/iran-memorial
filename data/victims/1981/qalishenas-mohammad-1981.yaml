circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Qalishenas, son of Heidar, along with
    another individual, was announced in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    August 16, 1981. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial other than he was tried at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz. Charges Regarding the charge brought
    against Mr. Qalishenas, Jomhuri Eslami wrote: “from the age of 16 to 55,
    he played the passive role in acts of sodomy, through which he has
    corrupted many young men”. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution refers to Mr. Qalishenas’s repeated confessions. International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the
    case of political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised.
    The National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners
    plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their
    political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations
    have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those
    prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available on his
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz condemned
    Mr. Mohammad Qalishenas to death. He, along with another individual, was
    stoned to death on August 14, 1981.
