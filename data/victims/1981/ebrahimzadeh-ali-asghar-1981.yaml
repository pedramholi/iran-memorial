    Mr. Ali Asghar Ebrahimzadeh, son of Habib, is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Additional
    information about Mr. Ali Asghar Ebrahimzadeh is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism by Rah-e Kargar publications. He was a
    sympathizer of the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran, Rah-e
    Kargar. The execution of Mr. Ebrahimzadeh, along with 29 other
    individuals, was announced in a communiqué of the Public Relations of the
    Central Public Prosecution Office and published in the Kayhan newspaper on
    December 1, 1981. According to this communiqué he was a member of the
    Razmandegan political party. But according to the Mojahed magazine, and
    the Rah-e Kargar book, he was a sympathizer of Rah-e Kargar. “Rah-e
    Kargar” or the “Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran” was
    established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They identified themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini’s
    leadership. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges According to the communiqué of the Public
    Relations of the Central Public Prosecution Office, the charges brought
    against Mr. Ebrahimzadeh were as follows: being an active member of the
    “Marxist group called Razmandagen, illegal relation with a young woman as
    an organizational marriage, [and] financial aid for the above
    Organization.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available about his defense. Judgment According to the
    communiqué of the Public Relations of the Central Public Prosecution
    Office, the Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Mr. Ali
    Asghar Ebrahimzadeh to death as a “religious ruling.” He was executed by a
    firing squad at Evin prison on September 30, 1981.
