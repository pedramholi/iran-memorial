    News of the execution of Mr. Hamid Reza Paridar, son of Hossein, was sent
    to the Boroumand Foundation via three electronic forms by persons close to
    him. Mr. Paridar s name is also on the list of the members of Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization (Majority) who have lost their lives. According to
    available information, Mr. Paridar was 25 years old, single, born in
    Hamedan, and was a senior in Industrial Engineering at Sharif University
    of Tehran and a supporter of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization Majority. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    After the 1979 Revolution, the organization, which renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority supported and considered the
    Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime. After the
    spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely
    because of their political beliefs. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Paridar s arrest and detention are not known. According to the
    information contained in the forms, Mr. Paridar was arrested on Sunday,
