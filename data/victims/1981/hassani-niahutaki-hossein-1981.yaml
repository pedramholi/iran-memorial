    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Hassani-Niahutaki, son of Akbar,
    along with four others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on July 27,
    1981. Mr. Hossein Hassani-Niahutaki is one of the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According to this
    source, Mr. Hossein Hassani-Niahutaki was a college graduate, single, and
    a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Arrest and detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention.
    Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kerman tried Mr. Hossein
    Hassani-Niahutaki, but no information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Hossein Hassani-Niahutaki were
    announced as, “sympathizing with the deviant and destructive group of
    Monafeqin [Mojahedin Khalq], practical participation toward the goals of
    this group, and distribution of its publication.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against the defendants. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Hossein Hassani-Niahutaki's defense. Judgment َThe
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kerman identified Mr. Hossein
    Hassani-Niahutaki as "Baghi (rebel), Mofsed (corruptor on Earth), Mohareb
    (fighter) against God and the Prophet, and Mortad (apostate)." He was
    condemned to death. The ruling was carried out when he was executed by
    firing squad in Kerman on July 26, 1981 at 5 am. No specific information
    is available about the defendant’s execution. According to the
    Revolutionary Public Prosecution Office in Kerman, “those who were
    annihilated have no right to be buried in the Moslem cemetery because they
    were apostate.” Mr. Hossein Hassani-Niahutaki was 22 years old.
