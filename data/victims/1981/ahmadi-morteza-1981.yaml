    News of the execution of Mr. Morteza Ahmadi, son of Ali, and 7 other
    individuals, was published in Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on Wedenesday,
    August 19, 1981, and in Kayhan newspaper on Thursday, August 20, 1981. The
    text of the communiqu containing the news of their execution, their
    identities and the charges brought against them, was provided to Pars News
    Agency by the Islamic Republic of Iran Revolutionary Prosecutor General s
    Office. Mr. Ahmadi is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Mr. Ahmad Hafezi was also arrested in connection
    with this group but committed suicide prior to being interrogated. Based
    on the communiqu of the Islamic Republic of Iran Revolutionary Prosecutor
    General s Office, the Qom Revolutionary Tribunal announced the names of
    Mr. Ahmadi and seven others who had been active and effective members and
    cronies of the Hypocrites (derogatory term used by the Islamic Republic to
    describe the MKO) Qom branch and had been arrested with the extremely
    effective cooperation of Qom s Moslem, [vigilant], and ever present [in
    the political, social, and cultural arenas] population, and had been tried
    in the court of Islamic Justice and and meted out divine punishment for
    their shameful and inhuman acts, in order to serve as a lesson in prudence
    and thinking [before taking action] to others. Based on available
    information, Mr. Ahmadi was a cleric who was a supporter of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention Based on the Islamic Republic of Iran
    Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office s communiqu , Mr. Ahmadi and 8
    other individuals were arrested in the city of Qom. Details of the
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Based on available information, the Qom Revolutionary Court tried
    Mr. Ahmadi and 7 other individuals. No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges According to the communiqu of the Islamic
    Revolutionary General Prosecutor s Office, Mr. Morteza Ahmadi s charge was
    stated as being the person in charge of the Hypocrites news section, Qom
    branch. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Ahmadi s defense. Judgment The
    Qom Islamic Revolutionary Court declared Mr. Morteza Ahmadi and 7 other
    individuals Mohareb with God and His Messenger ( One who wages war with
    God and the Prophet Mohammad, ) and Baqi against Islamic Rule ( One who
    has turned against Islam and Islamic Rule ) and sentenced them to death.
    He was shot by a firing squad in Qom on Tuesday, August 18, 1981. Mr.
    Ahmadi was 26 years old. _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO
    members from government offices and the closure of their centers and
    publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities
    different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two.
