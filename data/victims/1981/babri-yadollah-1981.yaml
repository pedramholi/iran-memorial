    Charges The charge against Mr. Yadollah Babri was announced as, raping a
    girl. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year
    Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Yadollah Babri's
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ardebil condemned Mr.

    12, 1981. No specific information is available about the defendant s
