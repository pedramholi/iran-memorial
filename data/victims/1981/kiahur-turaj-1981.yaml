    The information about Mr. Mr. Turaj Kijahur, son of Iraj, was provided by
    a relative, via an electronic form. His execution along with 60 others,
    was released by the Public Relations of the General Prosecutor's Office in
    a communiqué published in the Jomhuri Eslami on October 6, 1981. The
    communiqué, which specifies that those executed were “members and
    sympathizers of the anti-people groups who had risen against Islam and the
    Qur'an”, begins as follows: “By purging the corruptors, clean the earth
    from corruption (Qur'an). “Those who have not embraced faith and are
    combating in an idolatrous path are forming rank against pious people,
    and, by martyring the best and purest men, are attesting to the fact that
    they are mercenaries of the great powers. It is the duty of you pious men
    to stand up against them and uproot infidelity and hypocrisy.” Mr. Kiahur
    was born in 1957 in Tehran. He had a master's degree in civil engineering.

    the communiqué, are as follows: "[Rising] against Islam and the Qur'an by
    participating in armed demonstrations and clashes with the Revolutionary
    Guards, imposing martyrdom on people who are faithful to the revolution,
    being present in safe houses, identifying and assassinating known clerics

    of the Prison.
