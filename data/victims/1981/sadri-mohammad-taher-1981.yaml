    The news of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Taher Sadri, along with that of
    60 others, was released by the Public Relations of the General
    Prosecutor's Office in a press release published in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on October 6, 1981. The press release, which specifies that those
    executed were members and sympathizers of the anti-people groups who had
    risen up against Islam and the Qur'an , begins as follows: By purging the
    corruptors, clean the earth from corruption (Qur'an Karim). Those who have
    not embraced the faith are going down an idolatrous path. They are now
    joining against pious people, and, by martyring the best and purest men,
    are attesting to the fact that they are mercenaries of the great world
    powers. It is the duty of you pious men to stand up against them and
    uproot infidelity and hypocrisy. Mr. Mohammad Taher Sadri is one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Additional
    information about Mr. Mohammad Taher Sadri is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism by Rah-e Kargar Publications. He was a
    high school student and a sympathizer of the Rah-e Kargar Organization.
    "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was
    established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They introduced themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Arrest and detention According to the above book, Mr. Mohammad
    Taher Sadri was arrested in the summer of 1981, and taken to Evin Prison.
    Trial According to the above book, the trial date was October 5, 1981.
    Charges There is no mention of specific charges brought against this
    defendant. The General Prosecutor's Office does, however, provide specific
    charges against only one of the 61 individuals named in the press release.
    The press release notes that all the other defendants were members and
    sympathizers of unidentified anti-people groups. The charges against these
    groups, as specified in the press release, are as follows: [Rising]
    against Islam and the Qur'an by: participating in armed demonstrations and
    clashes with the Revolutionary Guards, imposing martyrdom on people who
    are faithful to the revolution, being present in safe houses, identifying
    and assassinating known clerics and state dignitaries, carrying arms and
    grenades to oppose defenseless people, taking action to blow up various
    centers, and being involved in armed car jacking and bank robberies . The
    book Our Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism states: After returning from
    the trial, the defendant told his cellmates that there was no charge
    brought against him other than distribution of leaflets at school. Then,
    the judge asked him whether he prays or not and whether he wants to pray
    with the Revolutionary Guards? His answer was negative. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available about his defense. Judgment
    Based on the Public Prosecutor s Office press release, the defendant was
    sentenced to death for being rebellious against Islam , an enemy of God ,
    and a corruptor on earth. The sentence was carried out at dawn on October
    5, 1981 at Evin Prison. According to the above book, Mr. Mohammad Taher
    Sadri was executed by a firing squad. He was probably 16 at the time of
    execution.
