    revolutionary forces. That's why I took up arms. My action is not
    anti-revolutionary or fighting against God. On the contrary, follows the
    path of the revolution." Judgment According to the official communiqu of
    the Public Prosecutor s Office, Mr. Salashur, along with 29 others, were
    declared corruptors, enemies of God and fighters against God and sentenced
