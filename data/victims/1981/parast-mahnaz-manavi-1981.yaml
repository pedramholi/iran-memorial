    Ms. Mahnaz Ma’navi Parast is one of the 1,533 executed prisoners listed by
    the Association of Iranian Women of Köln (Germany). The list, published on
    September 10, 1997, is entitled: "A Partial List of Women Executed by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran.” This list has been updated by former political
    prisoners living in various countries. Additional information about Ms.
    Mahnaz Ma’navi Parast is taken from the book Our Martyrs for Freedom and
    Socialism by Rah-e Kargar Publications. She was born in Tehran in 1959.
    She was a student at the Tehran College of Education. After the
    revolution, she joined the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran,
    Rah-e Kargar, and started her political activism under the name Manijeh.
    "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was
    established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They identified themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Arrest and detention Ms. Mahnaz Ma’navi Parast was arrested on

    they issued my sentence. I think I’m condemned to death... My dears, I
    have a lot to say but I cannot write anything. I want to spend my last
    moments recalling the happy memories that we had together.”
