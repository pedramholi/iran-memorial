    Reference to the execution of Mr. Jalal Azizi, an entrepreneur, and seven
    other members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha is in Iran,
    was made by the President of the Central Revolutionary Court in an
    interview published in Kayhan on 20 January 1982 (30 Day 1360). Mr. Azizi
    is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999 report published by the
    Baha i International Community. In addition, a report, The Persecution of
    the Baha i Community of Iran , in The Baha i World, Volume XIX, documents
    the persecutions of the members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978. More information has been
    drawn from other volumes of the The Baha i World , A Tribute to the
    Faithful by Mah Mehr Gulistanih, The Baha i Question: Iran s Secret
    Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community as well as a report
    on a press conference by the President of the Central Revolutionary Court
    in Kayhan Newspaper Nr. 11488 published on 20 January 1982 (30 Day 1360),
    and other reports provided by the Baha i International Community. Mr.
    Azizi was a member of several Baha i national committees such as
    pioneering, funds and pastoral care. He was elected a member of the Local
    Spiritual Assembly of the Baha is of Tehran and later the National
    Spiritual Assembly of the Baha is in August 1980. He served as the
    Chairman of the Assembly. [Gulistanih, p. 94] The Baha is in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have
    subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the
    largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in
    1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their
    most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under
    the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to
    it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the
    time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified
    and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Baha i National Spiritual Assembly After the
    Islamic Revolution In the organizational structure of the Baha i
    community, the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly is a body
    composed of nine individuals that are elected annually with the votes of
    adult Baha is in each country. This institution tends to the affairs and
    issues of the Baha i community on the national level. The National
    Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of guiding, coordinating, and
    moving forward the activities of each country s local spiritual
    assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl ( House of Justice
    ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the highest
    decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I s
    Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual
    assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz,
    were severely persecuted and the majority of their members were executed.
    In The Final Message of the Iran National Spiritual Assembly to the
    Friends of the Country , the Third Baha i National Spiritual Assembly,
    abiding by the principle of obeying the government, announced the closure
    of the Baha i organizations, and at the same time, sent an open letter to
    two thousand well-known and high-ranking government figures asking an end
    to the arrest, detention, torture, execution, and injustice against Baha
    is. (BBC Persian website, October 11, 2015). Judicial officials of the
    Islamic Republic have come up with [unreasonable and unacceptable]
    justifications for the persecution and the execution of the members of the
    National Spiritual Assemblies. In a speech on May 28, 1982, Ayatollah
    Khomeini said: The Baha is are not a religion, they re a [political] party
