    Mr. Manuchehr Tehrani is one of the 430 “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. More than 400 of the individuals on this
    list have been executed. Moreover, an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985,
    refers to Mr. Tehrani as one of the 12,028 individuals, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of
    dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Tehrani are not known. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Tehrani’s defense. Judgment Mr. Tehrani was shot by firing squad on
    November 7, 1981 in Qa’em Shahr.
