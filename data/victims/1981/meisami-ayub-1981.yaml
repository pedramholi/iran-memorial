    The execution of Mr. Ayub Meisami, son of Hossein, was announced in the
    Kayhan newspaper on June 24, 1981 and in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    June 25. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    trial session(s) other than he was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tabriz. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Meisami was the
    act of “sodomy.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution refers to Mr.
    Meisami’s repeated confessions. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on his defense. Judgment In accordance with
    the verdict of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz, Mr. Ayub
    Meisami was executed in Bonab (in East Azarbaijan province).
