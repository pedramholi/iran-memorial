    Was a man of strong faith and had repeatedly been harassed since childhood
    for his religious beliefs. News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Baqer
    (also spelled " Muhammad-Baqir (Suhayl)") Habibi, son of Nurmohammad and
    Hayat Soltan, and six other individuals* was published in Ettela at and
    Kayhan newspapers on June 15, 1981. Additional information about this case
    was obtained from Ettela at newspaper (June 17, and July 9, 1981);
    documents published on the Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran website
    including the last letter of two of his co-defendants (June 13, 1981); his
    letter of introduction; the defense written by the [city of] Hamedan
    Spiritual Assembly members (February 11, 1981); a Revolutionary Guardsman
    s testimony on his and his co-defendants behalf; Baha is National
    Spiritual Assembly of the United States Andalib (Winter 1990); Iran Wire
    website (September 7, 2014); the Baha i News videos on a YouTube channel
    (June 11, 2016); Baha is in the Media website (December 2008-January
    2009); Gooya News website (April 28, 2015); and Martyrs of the Baha i
    Faith website (February 9, 2013). Mr. Habibi was born into a Baha i family
    in the city of Hamedan on July 12, 1932. He had to switch schools because
    of his religious beliefs. After obtaining his high school diploma and due
    to economic hardship, Mr. Habibi started to work and began repairing radio
    and television sets with his brother. He was married, with three children.
    (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran; Baha i News). Mr. Habibi would
    travel to other towns in order to promote the Baha i faith; however, he
    was forced to return to Hamedan as there were threats made against his
    life and property, and he was threatened that all of his possessions would
    be looted. He had been arrested once in the summer of 1979 and had spent
    some time in prison undergoing interrogations. (Archives of Baha i
    Persecution in Iran; Iran Wire). This case is related to the arrest of 7
    members of the Hamedan s Baha i Spiritual Assembly** in 1980. The Baha is
    in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The Baha i religious community
    is the largest minority group in Iran, with approximately 300,000 members
    in 1979 (more current figures are not available).*** The authorities of
    the Islamic Republic have subjected Baha is religious to systematic
    harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human
    rights. The Baha i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of
    the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As
    a result, the Baha is have been denied the rights associated with the
    status of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their
    faith and are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law
    and in practice has subjected them to abuse and violence. **** Arrest and
    detention On November 3, 1980, Mr. Habibi was arrested at his daughter s
    home in Tehran by Comiteh agents. Since Mr. Habibi had been arrested as a
    result of mistaken identity, he was ordered released. Prior to his
    release, however, one of the soldiers remembered who he was from his prior
    arrest in Hamedan, and identified him. Rather than being released, he was
    taken from Tehran to Hamedan s Police Force Prison, where 6 other members
    of the Assembly were being detained. Mr. Habibi and his ward mates were
    allowed two visitations per week with their families. (Iran Wire).
    According to the spouse of one of Mr. Habibi s co-defendants, in the first
    two weeks of visitations, only the prisoners children were permitted to
    visit with their fathers; thereafter, their spouses were allowed
    visitation as well. Mr. Habibi and his co-defendants were kept in the
    general ward for four months and were then transferred to the political
    prisoners ward. (Martyrs of the Baha i Faith Facebook page, Martyrs of the
    Baha i Faith weblog). Mr. Habibi and his co-defendants had their last
    visitation with their families on June 11, 1981. Their families described
    them as being of strong spirit, calm and patient. (Iran Wire). Trial The
    Hamedan Islamic Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Habibi and three of his
    co-defendants in January-February 1981. According to Mr. Habibi, their
    defense was not being recorded at trial, and a portion of their defense
    that had been submitted in the form of a written brief was also not
    registered by the court clerk. He and his co-defendants were summoned to
    court for the last time in the third week of March 1981. (Iran Wire,
    Martyrs of the Baha i Faith weblog). Some of the information regarding
    trial sessions was obtained from one of Mr. Habibi s co-defendants
    handwritten notes. According to these notes, in addition to the charges
    officially brought against the defendants in the indictment, they were
    also questioned about their religious beliefs. (Baha is in the Media). Mr.
    Habibi did not have access to an attorney. Charges The charges brought
    against Mr. Habibi were cooperation with the Pahlavi regime (the pre-1979
    Revolution Monarchy) and havin
