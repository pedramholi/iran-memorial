    News of the execution of Mr. Samad Soltani, son of Azizollah, along with
    35 others, was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on November 26, 1981,
    quoting a communiqu from the Central Islamic Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor s Office. News of these executions, names, and charges against
    defendants are reflected in this communiqu . Additional information is
    based on an electronic form sent to Omid by Mr. Soltani s classmate. Also,
    he is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No. 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) on
    September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Mr. Samad Soltani s name is also mentioned in the book Our
    Martyrs on the Path to Freedom by Rah-e Kargar Publications. He was a
    sympathizer of the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran-Rah-e
    Kargar. According to the electronic form, Mr. Samad Soltani, 17, was a
    Kharazmi High School student in Tehran. He was smart and exceptionally
    good at math. He was also against armed struggle and guerrilla movement.
    His political activities in high school included selling Rah-e Kargar
    publications and distributing pamphlets of the organization. His classmate
    remembers him as a personable human being. International laws have
    strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the
    age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the
    Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offense
    committed before the age of eighteen. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary
    Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They
    identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic s and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Soltani s arrest and detention are unknown. According
    to his classmate, he was probably arrested in 1981. Trial According to the
    communiqu , the Central Islamic Revolutionary Court issued the ruling
    against Mr. Soltani and 35 others collectively. According to his
    classmate, Mr. Soltani had been condemned to four years imprisonment
    during his first trial. No information is available on this trial. Charges
    According to the Central Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s Office,
    the charges against Mr. Soltani were [being] an active member of the Rah-e
    Kargar [Organization] and participating in an armed demonstration of
    hypocrites [Mojahedin Khalq] against the regime of the Islamic Republic .
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt According to his cellmate, the evidence provided against
    Mr. Soltani was his short interview with Javanan magazine as a
    representative of the Rah-e Kargar Organization in the fall of 1980. His
    educational teacher in high school provided this interview for the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court. Defense No information is available about Mr.
    Soltani. Judgment The Central Islamic Revolutionary Court identified Mr.
    Samad Soltani as Mofsed [corruptor on Earth], Baghi [rebel], and Mohareb
    [fighter against God] and condemned him to death. The ruling was carried
    out at Evin Prison, and he was executed by a firing squad, along with 35
    others, on November 25, 1981, at dawn. According to his cellmate, the
    change of sentence to the death penalty, in the case of Mr. Soltani, was
    due to the appearance of his interview with the Javanan magazine at the
    court. Mr. Samad Soltani was only 17 years old.
