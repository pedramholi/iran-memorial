    News of the execution of Mr. Heidar Mohammadi, son of Mohammad, along with
    two others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on August 30, 1981, and
    the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August 31, 1981. The Islamic Revolutionary
    Courts of Birjand and Bushehr issued two announcements about these
    executions, the defendants' names and their charges, and the Public
    Relations Department of the Central Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor s
    Office released them to the media. Additional information regarding Mr.
    Mohammadi was sent via an electronic form to Omid by a person familiar
    with this case. Mr. Heidar Mohammadi is one of the 430 individuals whose
    names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class, published on the website of Andisheh va
    Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the organization
    who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on
    this list have been executed. Mr. Heidar Mohammadi is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No. 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According
    to the existing information, Mr. Mohammadi was born in Bordestan, Bushehr
    Province, in 1960. He was single, a high school graduate, a teacher, and a
    sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third Line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of Mr. Mohammadi s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial According to the Islamic Revolutionary Courts of Bushehr, this court
    issued the ruling against Mr. Mohammadi and two others. No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to the Islamic
    Revolutionary Courts of Bushehr, the charges against Mr. Mohammadi were
    announced as, planning to assassinate about one hundred officials of
    Bushehr; and committing destructive acts during the presidential election.
    This announcement also introduced him as a member of the American and
    fighter organization of Peykar. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Mohammadi. Defense No information is available about Mr.
    Mohammadi s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Courts of Bushehr
    identified Mr. Heidar Mohammadi as a Mohareb (fighter) against God and
    Prophet; Baghi (rebel) against the Islamic regime; and condemned him to
    death. The ruling was carried out in Bushehr on Friday August 28, 1981.
    Mr. Mohammadi was 21 years old.
