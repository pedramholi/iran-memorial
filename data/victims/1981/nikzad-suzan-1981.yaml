    The information about Ms. Suzan Nikzad is drawn from an interview with one
    of her relatives and the testimony of one of her cellmates (sent to Omid
    through an electronic form). She is one of 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups who were executed, or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Ms. Nikzad was born in Tehran, held
    a master’s of science degree in Nursing, was a hospital technician, and an
    active member of the Fadayian Khalq Minority Oraganization. The Fadayian
    Khalq Organization, a Marxist-Leninist group inspired by the Cuban
    Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded
    in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following
    the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle,
    split over the question of support for the Islamic Republic and the Soviet
    Union. The Fadayian Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was
    primarily active in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and
    detention Ms. Suzan Nikzad was arrested by the Revolutionary Guard in
    front of her home during the fall of 1981 due to the fact that she had
    distributed the Kar magazine of the Fadayian Khalq Minority. She was taken
    to Evin Prison. Based on the testimony of her cellmate, Ms. Nikzad was
    tortured during interrogation to obtain information and confession from
    her. Her feet were lashed and she was handcuffed with “qapan”. (Qapan, or
    Steelyard, was a common torture method during interrogations. In this
    method, the prisoner was handcuffed using the steelyard behind the back
    with one arm reaching the other from above the head. The pressure usually
    resulted in fractions in the shoulder blade. To make it more effective,
    the prisoner was usually suspended in the air using the steelyard.) Ms.
    Nikzad was detained for 4 weeks. She spent most of the time in the
    corridor of interrogation rooms or in a room down the corridor, from which
    she could hear the scream of inmates being tortured throughout the day and
    night. Her cellmate, who saw her after the initial interrogation following
    Ms. Nikzad’s arrest, remembers seeing her swollen feet. During the
    interrogation, at least once the authorities took Ms. Nikzad to her house,
    in order to arrest her friends and other political activists that she was
    to identify. According to her cellmate, Ms. Nikzad constantly argued with
    Revolutionary Guards and her interrogators about politics and defended her
    political beliefs. After the interrogations, she was taken to the medical
    unit of Evin. During her detention, she did not have the right to be
    represented by an attorney. Prison authorities did not grant her
    visitation rights and did not allow her to write to her family. Ms. Nikzad
    was in good spirits in prison and always tried to strengthen the moral of
    her inmates. Her cellmate, who was frightened on her first day at Evin
    after having heard screams and seen tortured prisoners, remembers Ms.
    Nikzad's effort to calm her down with humour and compassion during the
    lunch they shared that day. Moreover, Ms. Nikzad, who was a nurse, looked
    after inmates who were injured during torture, robbed and washed the
    wounds on their feet. She also taught others how to massage [the wounds to
    reduce the pain]. Her identity had been disclosed by a friend, leading to
    her arrest. But Ms. Nikzad would say she did not hold grudge against that
    friend since she acted under torture. Trial The trial took place at Evin
    Prison. No other information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges No information is available on Ms. Suzan Nikzad’s charges.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available about
    the defendant’s defense. The interviewee quotes one of her cellmates
    according to whom Ms. Suzan Nikzad defended her beliefs so well that the
    Judge asked her: “Am I trying you, or are you trying me?” In her
    interrogations and trial, she defended Marxism. Her cellmate saw her from
    under the blindfolds in the corridor as Ms. Nikzad was arguing with the
    interrogator about atheism. She showed her hands to the interrogator and
    said: “it is these hands that created God.” Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran condemned Ms. Suzan Nikzad to death. She
    was executed by a firing squad at Evin Prison on November 19, 1981. Her
    cellmate recalls Ms. Nikzad’s last minutes: “When her name was called in
    the afternoon of November 19, she raised her hands with a smile on her
    face as she was going out of the cell and this is how she said goodbye to
    all of us who had gathered to see her for the last time.” According to the
    interviewee, when Ms. Suzan Nikzad’s mother went to visit her at Evin
    Prison, officials t
