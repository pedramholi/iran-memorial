    Ms. Nasrin Amuzgar is one of hundreds of individuals who were
    extrajudicially executed since the 1979 revolution. In many cases, these
    killings were carried out by agents of the Islamic Republic or can
    reasonably be assumed to be the result of the Iranian government policy.
    Ms. Amuzgar is one of the 430 individuals whose name appears on the list
    of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class” published on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This execution was
    also announced in the addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published
    by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization on the September 6, 1985. The list
    includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups,
    who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic
    security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    This killing is also reported in the Peykar magazine No. 113 (July 6,
    1981) According to the available information, Ms. Nasrin Amuzgar was born
    in 1961 and was a sympathizer of the Peykar organization. She was a
    candidate to become a member of this Organization. She was in charge of
    the activities of Peykar in Tolidaru and another pharmaceutical factory.
    She was shot by a Revolutionary Guardsman on Azari street (Tehran) on June
    18, 1981. She was in comatose for 10 days and died on June 28. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence.
