    The execution of Mr. Behruz Khasseh and 14 other individuals was announced
    in the Kayhan newspaper No. 11340 dated the 22nd of July 1981. Public
    Relations department of the Public Prosecution Office released the names
    and charges of the convicted individuals to the media. Mr. Khasseh is one
    of the 430 individuals whose name appears on the list of Martyrs of the
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on
    the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those
    members of the Organization who died after the Revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. This
    execution was also announced in the addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No.
    261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization on the 6th of
    September 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    Public Prosecution Office did not release the charges brought against Mr.
    Behruz Khasseh to the media. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on his defense.
    Judgment In accordance with the verdict of the Central Revolutionary
    Tribunal, Mr. Behruz Khasseh was executed by a firing squad at Evin Prison
    in Tehran on the 21st of July 1981. No information is available about the
    judgment but the bodies of the executed individuals were transferred to
    the forensic medical team.
