    The news regarding Mr. Abdorreza Pur Bakhtegan s execution was published
    in Keyhan and Jomhuri Eslami s newspapers on 08 September 1981. A press
    release by the Revolutionary Guards of Fasa, which was included in this
    same news, stated that Mr. Pur Bakhtefan was an active member of Monafeqin
    (a term the Islamic government used to refer to the followers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization literary meaning hypocrites) and was chased
    by the Revolutionary Guards for a while. The Revolutionary Guards thereby
    ask the deceived members of these groups to repent and come forward before
    being arrested. Mr. Pur Bakhtegan is also one of the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The addendum lists individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Supplemental information about Mr.
    Pur Bakhtegan was sent to the Boroumand Foundation via an electronic form
    by a person informed about his case. According to this information, Mr.
    Pur Bakhtegan, son of Ja far, was born in Shiraz in 1963. He was a high
    school student and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention According to the information sent by the
    electronic form, Mr. Pur Bakhtegan was arrested by the Revolutionary
    Guards in Shiraz and was then transferred to Fasa for interrogation and
    detention. Trial No information is available on Mr. Pur Bakhtegan s trial.
    Charges According to Keyhan newspaper, Mr. Pur Bakhtegan was charged with
    membership in the safe houses and acting to overthrow the Islamic
    Republic. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    accused cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a
    fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Pur
    Bakhtegan. Defense No information is available on Mr. Pur Bakhtegan s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Estehbanat sentenced
    Mr. Bur Bakhtegan to death and his sentence was carried out on September
    6, 1981 in Fasa ( Keyhan newspaper). The information in the addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine and the information sent via the electronic form
    match this date. Based on the addendum to the Mojahed magazine, he was
    executed by a firing squad. ------------------------------------- *The
    exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of their
    centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic
    authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the
    two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites
    and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin
    sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while distributing
    publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20,
    1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by
    governmental officials and the government officials efforts to impeach
    their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the
    regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets,
    some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The
    number of casualties that resulted from this demonstr
