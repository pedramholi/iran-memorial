    News of the execution of Mr. Hosseinali Dianati, son of Safarali, along
    with twenty-two others, was published in the Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami
    newspapers on July 19, 1981, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office of the Islamic Republic. Mr.
    Hosseinali Dianati is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. According to this source, Mr.
    Hosseinali Dianati, aged 16, was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. International laws have strictly prohibited capital
    punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members’ interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah’s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization’s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention According to the announcement by the Public
    Relations Office of the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office of
    the Islamic Republic, Mr. Hosseinali Dianati, along with eighty-nine
    others, was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards in Hezardastgah Naziabad
    Golabdareh on June 17, 1981. The Revolutionary Guards had surrounded the
    building. Mr. Hosseinali Dianati was detained and interrogated for
    eighteen days. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran tried these
    defendants. The trial sessions continued in various branches of the
    Revolutionary Courts until July 5, 1981. Charges The charges against Mr.
    Hosseinali Dianati, along with fourteen others, were collectively
    announced as, “being main coordinators, trainers, and directors of the
    team house, supplying weapons, sending other defendants to the streets and
    public places after being trained for using weapons, and personally
    fighting with weapons” by the Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt According to the above report, the evidence presented
    against the defendants was as follows: “During the search of the mentioned
    team house, many weapons were recovered such as G3 machineguns, Molotov
    cocktails, containers of incendiary materials, bullets for Colt, Uzi, and
    G3 weapons, bows and arrow, slings, knives, carpet cutters, homemade
    grenades, bags of salt and pepper, pieces of stone and brick, gallows’
    ropes, and other tools such as spray paint, caskets, net caps, canteens,
    back packs, cameras, radios, calculators, overcoats, fabric bags, and many
    books and tapes and documents and publications of Monafeqin [Mojahedin
    Khalq] which were partially burned by them.” The “confessions” of the
    defendants and “testimonies of the Revolutionary Guards who discovered the
    team house” were also presented as evidence. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In th
