    The news of the execution of Mr. Ali Sadeqi and 18 other individuals was
    announced by a Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office
    communiqué published in Kayhan and Jomhouri Eslami newspapers on August
    16, 1981. Mr. Sadeqi, a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, is
    also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members’ interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah’s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization’s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Sadeqi’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial According to the Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office communiqué, the Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal issued Mr. Sadeqi’s sentence. No information is
    available on Mr. Sadeqi’s trial. Charges The Central Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecutor’s Office communiqué announced the following charges jointly
    against Mr. Sadeqi and 18 other individuals: “waging war on God and His
    Prophet,” “supporting anti-people grouplets,” “attacking innocent
    civilians and assault, battery and murder of the same,” “living in safe
    houses,” “acting to overthrow the Islamic Republic,” “planning the
    assassination of state dignitaries,” and “attempting to implement the
    plans of world imperialism, particularly America.” This communiqué
    announced the only charge specific to Mr. Sadeqi as “active membership in
    the anti-people Hypocrites Organization.” Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against Mr. Sadeqi. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Sadeqi’s defense. Judgment The Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    sentenced Mr. Sadeqi to death. Mr. Sadeqi was executed by a firing squad
    on August 15, 1981 in Tehran’s Evin prison. _________________________ *The
    exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of their
    centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic
    authorities’ different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between
    the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as
    “Hypocrites” and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
    treatment by governmental officials and the government officials’ efforts
    to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact
    that the regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and
    Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from this
    demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were arrested
    and executed in the following days and weeks. The day after the
    demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a repressive campaign –
    unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and
    sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO
    announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and assassinated
    a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the Islamic regime.
