    The execution of Mr. Vahid Rahbari Irani, son of Javad, and 21 other
    individuals was announced by the Public Relations section of the Central
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office and published in the Jomhuri
    Eslami and the Kayhan newspapers on December 26, 1981. Mr. Rahbari Irani
    was affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial, other than he
    was tried at the Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal. Charges The
    personal charges brought against Mr. Rahbari Irani are not known. He and
    18 other individuals were collectively charged with: “Plotting and
    rebellion against the regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran,
    participation in armed demonstration, including the demonstration of June
    20, providing place and financing for the Hypocrites [i.e. the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization], participation in assassinations of the Revolutionary
    Guards brothers, possession of arms and ammunitions, active membership in
    armed teams of the Hypocrites, and living in safe houses.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. The demonstration
    of June 20, 1981, took place in protest against the parliament’s
    impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic’s systematic
    policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) from the
    country’s political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with
    MKO leaders and his insistence for them to disarm. The MKO had until then
    supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function
    within the framework of the new political system. On June 20, the
    Organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations, in which some of the
    demonstrators were armed, all over the country. These demonstrations,
    which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of
    demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that targeted not only
    the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized as
    official government policy the months-old state harassment and suppression
    of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Rahbari Irani’s defense.
    Judgment The Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Mr. Vahid
    Rahbari Irani to death. According to Kayhan , he was executed in Tehran on
    December 23, 1981.
