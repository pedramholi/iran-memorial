    Information regarding the execution of Mr.Reza Shamsa'i (Qahyazi) has been
    sent to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center via two electronic forms on April 06,
    2015 and August 21, 2021 by people who knew him. Mr. Shamsa'i's was also
    one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr.
    Shamsa'i was a an electronic engineer graduated from Sharif University and
    was a support of Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Shamsa'i s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    No information is available on Mr. Shamsa'i's trial. Charges According to
    the electronic forms, Mr. Shamsa'i was charged with regard to the hiding
    of other MKO supporters in his house. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Shamsa'i
    (Qahyazi) s defense. Judgment Mr. Reza Shamsa'i (Qahyazi) was executed
    with firing squad behind ward 4 of Evin Prison in 1981. (E-forms)
    ----------------------------------------- * The exclusion of MKO members
    from government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing
    houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981,
    the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and
    assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the
    Islamic regime. In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the
    impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they
    founded the National Council of Resistance. After
