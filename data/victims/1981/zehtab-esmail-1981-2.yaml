    Information about the execution of Dr. Esma il Zehtab, son of Mohammad and
    father of four, and 8 other Baha is was obtained from a communique from
    the Public Relations office of the Tabriz Revolutionary Prosecutors
    Office, published in Kayhan Daily Newspaper (August 3rd, 1981), which
    announced his execution. Other sources covering his life and time in
    prison were included in the Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran (ABPI),
    a letter from his wife to sharia Judge Mr. Mousavi regarding Dr. Zehtab s
    imprisonment, as well as a feature on the IranWire webpage (June 15th,
    2022). Dr. Zehtab, was born into a Muslim family in Charandab, Tabriz
    Province, in 1920 (IranWire). After completing ninth grade, Dr. Zehtab
    began working as an apprentice in Tabriz and by the age of 20 he opened
    his own clinic in Khalkhal, where there were no dentists. He reportedly
    gained popularity as he offered his services for free to those who could
    not afford them. He met his wife in Khalkhal and the couple had four
    children. In a period of increased religiously motivated attacks on Baha
    is in 1955, Dr. Zehtab left for Tabriz after his home in Khalkhal was
    attacked by stone throwing mobs and authorities, rather than stopping the
    attackers, raided his home and asked him to convert to Islam. Dr. Zehtab
    opened a new clinic in Tabriz, completed his high school diploma, a modern
    dentistry course, and a university degree in dentistry in Turkey (ABPI,
    IranWire). Dr. Zehtab, who had converted to Baha ism at the age of 18 and
    had been a member of Khalkhal s Baha is Local Spiritual Assembly, was
    elected as a member and served as the treasurer for the Local Spiritual
    Assembly of the Baha is of Tabriz. Dr. Zehtab was arrested for the first
    time on October 19th, 1979, during a meeting of the Local Spiritual
    Assembly along with six other members, without a warrant, according to his
    wife (ABPI, Letter from Monireh Zehtab to Judge Mousavi November 7th,
    1979). He was released for a few hours, before the revolutionary court of
    Tabriz ordered his rearrest and the confiscation of his religious books on
    the same day. He was detained for six months, including 20 days of
    solitary confinement, during which he was pressured to renounce his faith.
    He was released on March 22nd, 1980 on bail (IranWire- ABPI). The Baha is
    in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979 (1) - to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence. (2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Baha i National Spiritual Assembly After the
    Islamic Revolution In the organizational structure of the Baha i
    community, the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly is a body
    composed of nine individuals that are elected annually with the votes of
    adult Baha is in each country. This institution tends to the affairs and
    issues of the Baha i community on the national level. The National
    Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of guiding, coordinating, and
    moving forward the activities of each country s local spiritual
    assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl ( House of Justice
    ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the highest
    decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I s
    Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual
    assemblies in various cities, including Tehran,
