    The execution of Mr. Ebrahim Jalali, son of Mohammad Ali, along with three
    other individuals, was announced by the Revolutionary Guards of Gilan
    province and published in the Kayhan newspaper on August 3, 1981. He is
    also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on
    September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. According to the Mojahed magazine, Mr. Jalali was affiliated
    with the Razmandegan Organization, however the newspaper named him “a head
    of the Minority guerillas [referring to Fadaiyan Khalq Organization
    (Minority branch)] in Saravan region” (Sistan and Baluchestan province).
    The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and
    was active mainly in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest
