    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Akbar Mahmudi, son of Mohammad, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August 19, 1981. He is among
    the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on
    the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr. Mahmudi
    is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on
    September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Mr. Mahmudi was from Dasht-e Bayaz in Gonabad (Khorasan
    province). The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr. Mahmudi was charged with bring "an
    active supporter of the infidel organization of Peykar, possession of some
    prohibited and harmful documents, which prove opposition to the Islamic
    Republic, participation in discussions and fighting in University Street,
    promoting the apostolic ideas of Marxism and Communism, [playing] an
    effective role in fighting in Kakhk and Gonabad and intimidation,
    spreading terror and insecurity in the region...” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mahmudi’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Mashad called Mr. Ali Akbar Mahmudi an “infidel, apostate,
    corruptor on earth, enemy of God, and rebel against the Islamic regime”
    and condemned him to death. The High Judicial Council approved the
    sentence. Mr. Mahmudi was executed by firing squad in Mashad on August 17,
    1981.
