    The news of the execution of Mr. Bahman Kia was announced in a report
    published in Kayhan on July 8, 1981. Mr. Kia, 19, and a supporter of the
    Fadayian Guerrilla Organization, is also one of the 12028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Fadayian Khalq Guerrilla
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerrilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. A
    number of the Organization’s members, who did not renounce armed struggle,
    founded the group the Fadayian Khalq Guerrillas (Ashraf Dehqani Branch).

    against the Islamic Republic.” The Kayhan report also referred to Mr. Kia
    as an “apostate” . Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Kia.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Kia’s defense. Judgment The
