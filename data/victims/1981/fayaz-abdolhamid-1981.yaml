    The execution of Mr. Abdolhamid Fayaz, son of Ali, along with 18 other
    individuals, was announced in a communiqué of the Public Relations of the
    Central Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office, and was published in the Keyhan
    and the Jomhuri Eslam newspapers on August 16, 1981. Further information
    about the execution of Mr. Abdolhamid Fayaz was sent to the Boroumand
    Foundation through an electronic form. Mr. Fayaz is also one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    Additionally, he is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the Organization who died after the
    Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. The communiqué of the Central Revolutionary Prosecutor’s
    Office, which calls the convicts “sworn agents of the superpowers”, begins
    with a reference to the Koran: “It is but a just recompense for those who
    make war on God and His apostle and endeavor to spread corruption on
    earth, that they are being slain in great numbers, or crucified in great
    numbers, or have, in result of their perverseness, their hands and feet
    cut off in great numbers, or are being [entirely] banished from [the face
    of] the earth: such is their ignominy in this world . But in the life to
    come [yet more] awesome suffering awaits them” [5:33]. Mr. Fayaz was born
    in Kermanshah in 1954. He was single, a university graduate, and a
    sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to the form, Mr. Abdolhamid Fayaz was arrested in Tehran on July
    13, 1981 late evening. The exact circumstances of his arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges In the communiqué of the Central Revolutionary Public Prosecutor’s
    Office, there is no reference to a specific crime committed by any single
    defendant. The communiqué refers to Mr. Fayaz as “an active member of the
    Peykar Organization and in charge of the Distribution Committee of the
    organization.” It also states some collective charges such as “attacking
    innocent people, assault and battery, murder, frequenting the
    organization's houses, activities for overthrowing the Islamic Republic
    regime, planning to assassinate officials, intending to carry out plans
    for world imperialism headed by the US, and fighting against God and the
    Prophet.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Fayaz’s defense. Judgment َThe
    Central Islamic Revolutionary Court condemned Mr. Abdolhamid Fayaz to
    death and he was shot by a firing squad at Evin prison in Tehran on August
    15, 1981.
