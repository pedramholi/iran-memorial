    News of the execution of Mr. Esma il Shirali, along with twenty-one
    others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on September 13, 1981. The
    Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor s Office
    announced these executions, the defendants' names and their charges. Mr.
    Esma il Shirali is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the
    list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. According to this report, Mr. Esma il Shirali was a
    student. Mr. Esma il Shirali is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to the above announcement, Mr. Esma il Shirali was arrested
    three times. The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to the above announcement, the charges against Mr. Esma
    il Shirali were announced as, active member of the American organization
    of Peykar, participation in the clashes in Beheshtabad, Ramhormoz,
    carrying the red flag of Peykar according to witnesses and his own
    confession, and attacking innocent people. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Esma il Shirali's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Aghajari identified Mr. Esma il Shirali as "Baghi
    (rebel), Mofsed (corruptor on Earth), Mohareb (fighter) against God the
    Prophet, and Mortad (apostate)." He was condemned to death. The ruling was
    carried out when he was executed in Aghajari on September 22, 1981.
