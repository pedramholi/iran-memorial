    Mr. Khosro Bayrami is one of the 430 “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of
    Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of 400 members and
    sympathizers of the Organization who have been executed. He is also one of
    the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985.
    The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups,
    who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic
    security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    Mr. Bayrami was a photographer from Hamadan. The Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention

    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No

    available on Mr. Bayrami’s defense. Judgment Mr. Khosro Bayrami was
    executed by firing squad in Babol in 1981.
