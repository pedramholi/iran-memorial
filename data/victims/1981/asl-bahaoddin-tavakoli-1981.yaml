    The news of the execution of Mr. Baha odin Tavakoli Asl, son of Shakur,
    was published in the Kayhan newspaper on November 12, 1981. Additional
    information about Mr. Tavakoli was sent to the Boroumand Foundation via
    several electronic forms by people informed about his case. According to
    this information, Mr. Tavakoli was born in Ardebil in 1960. He was a high
    school graduate and worked as foreman in heating construction business. He
    was a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. Mr. Tavakoli is one of the
    430 Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class, published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar . This list
    contains the names of 400 members of the organization who have been
    executed. Additionally, Mr. Tavakoli is among the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of
    dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to information included in the electronic form, Mr. Tavakoli was
    arrested in Tabriz in the summer of 1981. There is no further information
    available on his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Tavakoli was tried by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz (Kayhan newspaper). Charges The
    charges against Mr. Tavakoli, and six other members and sympathizers of
    the grouplet Peykar were announced by the Keyhan newspaper as follows:
    armed rebellion against the Islamic Republic, distribution of leaflets and
    publications for the Peykar Organization, apostasy, and frequenting the
    organization s safe houses. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against Mr. Tavakoli cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Tavakoli. Defense No information is available on Mr. Tavakoli s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz condemned Mr. Baha odin
    Tavakoli Asl to death and he was executed by a firing squad in Tabriz
    prison. The exact date of his execution is not clear. He might have been
    executed on November 9 or 10 (Kayhan Newspaper), November 8 (the
    electronic form), or November 11 of 1981 (the addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine).Mr. Tavakoli was buried in Vadi Rahmat cemetery in Tabriz.
