    Mr. Karim Jabbari is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Mr. Jabbari received his PhD in Agriculture from Freiburg
    University in Germany and taught in Gilan University after returning to
    Iran in 1977. He was also active among the fishermen in connection with
    the Peykar Organization. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Jabbari was arrested in 1981. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Jabbari’s
    charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain

    No information is available on Mr. Jabbari’s defense. Judgment Mr. Jabbari
    was executed in 1981. No other information is available about this
    execution.
