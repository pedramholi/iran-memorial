    The news of Ms. Mina Arehchi s execution, and 22 others, comes from the
    Kayhan daily on September 23, 1981 that quotes the Islamic Republic s
    Public Prosecutor s Central Office. Additional information was drawn from
    an electronic form was sent to Omid by a person familiar with her case.
    Furthermore, Ms. Arehchi is one of the 1533 executed prisoners listed by
    the Association of Iranian Women of K ln (Germany). The list published in
    1997 is entitled: "A partial list of names of women executed by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran. This execution was also reported in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Ms. Arehchi was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO), an Islamist Revolutionary Organization that supported
    the 1979 revolution and the Islamic Republic until June 1981, when it
    joined the opposition. In June 20, 1981, a large demonstration took place
    in protest against the parliament's impeachment of President Banisadr and
    the Islamic Republic's systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) from the country's political scene, the refusal of
    Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO leaders, and his insistence for them
    to disarm. The MKO, a Marxist Islamist revolutionary organization, had
    until then supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to
    function within the framework of the new political system. On June 20th,
    the organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing nation-wide mass demonstrations in which some of the
    demonstrators were armed. These protests, which were severely suppressed
    and resulted in the killing of dozens of demonstrators, were followed by a
    wave of mass arrests and executions by the Revolutionary Guards and
    para-military forces that targeted not only the MKO, but all other
    opposition groups. The massive repression, unprecedented in the history of
    the Islamic Republic, legitimized as official government policy the
    months-old state harassment and suppression of dissidents and resulted in
    the banning of all forms of independent political dissent. Arrest and
    detention According to the information on the form, Ms. Arehchi was
    arrested on September 11, 1981, around 3 pm. She was taken to the
    Revolutionary Committee and later transferred to the Evin Prison. Ms.
    Arehchi was not allowed any visitation with her family; her only contact
    with her family was reported to be a phone call that alerted them of her
    arrest. She was not given access to an attorney. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. The Kayhan daily mentions that the
    Central Islamic Revolutionary Court gave out the verdict in Ms. Arehchi s
    case. It is not clear, however, if Ms. Arehchi was tried by this court.
    Charges The charges against Ms. Arehchi were announced by the Islamic
    Republic s Public Prosecutor s Central Office. These charges were
    published by Kayhan daily and are as follows: Being a member of the
    American hypocrites organization (a name commonly used for the MKO by the
    Islamic government), being present in team houses, being a member of the
    publicity team, having Molotov cocktail, participating in armed
    demonstrations, throwing Molotov cocktails at different locations, helping
    in the identification of the Hezbollah houses. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Ms. Arehchi s defense. Judgment Ms. Arehchi was declared a
    corruptor on earth and an enemy of God and was sentenced to death. She was
    executed in the evening at Evin Prison.
