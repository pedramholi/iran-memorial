    The information about Mr. Mohammad Naqi Ezzabadi has been drawn from
    interview by a person close to him, the report of the Kayhan newspaper
    referring to the communiqu of the public relations unit of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office (Oct. 3, 1981) and the Khorasan
    newspaper (Oct. 4). Mr. Ezzabadi is one of the 12028 individuals listed in
    an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Mr. Ezzabadi was born in Nojnurd in 1959. He was a
    high school graduate and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. At the time of the Revolution, he was serving his compulsory
    military service in the navy. After the Revolution, he distributed the
    publications of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in the city. He was
    arrested in 1980 in a street demonstration and was detained at Qezelhesar
    and Qasr prisons for 9 months. About one month after he was released from
    prison, he went to Nojnurd in June or July of 1981. Once Revolutionary
    Guards raided his home but he managed to escape. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Ezzabadi was arrested in July or August of 1981 in his home in Nojnurd for
    sympathizing with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization without an arrest
    warrant. He was taken to a hotel, which had been confiscated and was used
    as the detention center of the Revolutionary Guards. According to the
    interviewee, the Revolutionary Guardsmen raided the house and when the
    victim s father asked, they said that they only wanted ask him a few
    questions and that he would soon return home. Mr. Ezzabadi was in prison
    for 40 days. The night before his execution, he called his parents from
    prison and they went to the headquarters of the Revolutionary Guards. The
    head of the Guards told his father: We know he has not done anything but
    he refuses to do what we want him to do. That night in a visit, Mr.
    Ezzabadi told his father: They want me to do things that you would also
    refuse, referring to recanting his political beliefs, introducing
    political colleagues to the Guards, and shooting coup de grace at persons
    who were to be executed. His father, who was a prominent person in the
    city, approved his son s actions and left the location in a fury. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial, except than Mr.
    Ezzabali was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Nojnurd.
    Charges According to the Kayhan newspaper, Mr. Ezzabadi was charged with:
    Organizing the Hypocrites [referring to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization],
    being in charge of operational teams, distributing the leaflets of the
    Hypocrites, approving their stance and their armed struggle. Moreover, the
    named individual had been condemned to imprisonment, during which he
    caused an arson in Mashad prison, and resumed activities against the
    regime of the Islamic republic after being released. According to the
    interviewee, a newspaper announced his charged to be apostasy. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Ezzabadi s defense at the trial.
    According to the available information, he was denied access to his file
    and the right to be represented by an attorney. The interviewee states
    that the charge of causing an arson in Mashad prison was completely
    baseless. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Nojnurd called
    Mr. Mohammad Naqi Ezzabadi an enemy of God and his Prophet and a rebel
    against the Islamic regime and condemned him to death. He was shot by
    firing squad on September 30, 1981 ( Kayhan ). He was 22 years old. His
    cousin, who was a doctor, saw four bodies at the morgue, one of whom was
    Mohammad Naqi. The Revolutionary Guards told his family members that they
    could not inter his body in the public cemetery and could not hold any
    memorial ceremonies. They were told to bury him in the mountains. His
    family transferred the body to Mashad and laid him to rest in Mashad s
    cemetery. His mother still has his blood-stained shirt.
