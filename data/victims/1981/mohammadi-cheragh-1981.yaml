    News of the execution of Mr. Cheragh Mohammadi, son of Dadkarim, along
    with seventeen others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on September
    26, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Revolutionary and Public
    Prosecutor’s Office issued an announcement about these executions, the
    defendants' names, and their charges, and released it to the media. Mr.
    Cheragh Mohammadi is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. According to this report, Mr. Cheragh Mohammadi was a high
    school teacher. Mr. Cheragh Mohammadi is one of the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of
    dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Cheragh Mohammadi were published in the report as
    "membership and continuous activity in the rebellious organization of
    Peykar, his clear confession of being apostate, accepting responsibility
    in the Organization, and acting against the Islamic Republic of Iran." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt According to the Public Relations Department of the
    Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor’s Office, “a hand gun has been
    recovered from the defendant.” This statement also declared that Mr.
    Mohammadi explicitly confessed to apostasy. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Cheragh Mohammadi's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Zahedan identified Mr. Cheragh Mohammadi as "Mofsed
    (corruptor on Earth), Mohareb (fighter) against God and the Prophet, and
    Mortad (apostate)." He was condemned to death. The ruling was carried out
    when he was executed in September of 1981. According to the website of
    Andeesheh va Peykar, he was executed by firing squad on September 20,
    1981.
