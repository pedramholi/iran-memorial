circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Bushehr Niknam has been announced in the Enqelab
    Eslami newspaper on January 6, 1981. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Niknam’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    There is no information regarding this trial, other than Mr. Niknam was
    tried at the Second Branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Shiraz. Charges Mr. Niknam was charged with “repeated accounts of rape.”
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against the accused. The newspaper reported a previous
    conviction: “The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz had tried and
    condemned the accused to imprisonment; however, he had been released due
    to his young age and expressing regrets [about what he had done].” Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Niknam’s defense. Judgment The
    Second Branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz condemned
    Mr. Bushehr Niknam to death. He was shot by a firing squad in the
    afternoon of January 5, 1981.
