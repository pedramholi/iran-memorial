    The Public Relations Department of the Central Prosecutor s Office of the
    Islamic Republic announced the information about Ms. Shahnaz Abdollahi,
    daughter of Ali, along with 14 other individuals in a communiqu ,
    published in the Kayhan newspaper on November 2, 1981. Ms. Abdollahi is
    one of the 430 individuals whose name appears on the list of Martyrs of
    the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published
    on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This execution was also announced in
    the addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin
    Khalgh Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes 12,028
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of
    dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Ms.
    Abdollahi was charged with apostasy, active cooperation with the Peykar
    Organization, which is at war with God, copperation with Komaleh, the
    Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran, the Rastegari Organization in Kurdistan,
    delivering speeches in villages to provoke and incite the public against
    the Islamic Republic of Iran, and having various responsibilities for the
    Peykar Organization. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms. Abdollahi s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Esfehan called Ms. Shahnaz
    Abdollahi corruptor on earth, at war with God, and a rebel and condemned
    him to death. She was executed in Esfehan on October 28 or 29, 1981.
