    The news of the execution of Mr. Mojtaba Qorbani and another individual
    was announced in a Kayhan report published on July 27, 1981. Mr. Qorbani,
    24, teacher, and a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, is also
    one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention According to the Kayhan report Mr. Qorbani
    was summoned to court. No information is available on Mr. Qorbani s
    detention. Trial Based on the available information, the Rasht Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal issued Mr. Qorbani s sentence. No information is
    available on Mr. Qorbani s trial. Charges According to the Kayhan report
    Mr. Qorbani was charged with armed rebellion against the Islamic Republic,
    having a safe house in Rasht, leading the Mojahedin national movement in
    Rudbar, widespread efforts towards misleading the youth in the said town,
    and propaganda against the Islamic Republic. . Evidence of guilt According
    the Kayhan report, Mr. Qorbani plead guilty to the charges and stated that
    whenever he is released from prison he would wage an armed and violent
    struggle against the Islamic Republic. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense No information is available on Mr. Qorbani s defense.
    Judgment The Rasht Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal found Mr. Qorbani guilty
    of corruption on earth and waging war on God, and sentenced him to death.
    Mr. Qorbani was sentenced by a firing squad on July 26, 1981 in Rasht. Mr.
    Qorbani was 24 years old at the time of his execution.
    _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were a
