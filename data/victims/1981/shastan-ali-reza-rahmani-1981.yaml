    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Reza Rahmani Shastan, son of Nurmohammad,
    along with fourteen others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper
    on June 23, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Public
    Prosecutor s Office issued an announcement concerning these executions,
    the defendants' names, and their charges, and released it to the media.
    Information about him has been drawn from an electronic form sent to Omid
    by a relative, the Peykar magazine (No. 112, June 29, 1981), the Peykargar
    magazine (No. 11, September 1987), the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar, and the addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No. 261, September 6, 1985), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Mr. Rahmani Shastan, an ethnic Baluch, was born in 1954to an
    influential family in Shastan (in the south eastern province of Saravan in
    Baluchestan). He was a graduate of the Hamadan Agricultural College. He
    was the sole candidate from Saravan to run for the first parliamentary
    election and was supported by the Peykar Organization. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention When Mr. Rahmani Shastan was traveling from Zahedan to
    Tehran on March 11, 1981, a few Revolutionary Guards recognized him as a
    political activist and arrested him. They took him to the base of the
    Revolutionary Guards in Tehran and later transferred him to a solitary
    cell in Ward 209 of Evin prison. His mother visited him once and the
    officials confronted her with insult and humiliation. His arrest took
    place before the demonstration on June 30 which contradicts the claim of
    the announcement by the Public Prosecutor s Office naming Mr. Rahmani
    Shastan as a person arrested for organizing this demonstration. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to
    the announcement issued by the Public Relations Department of the Central
    Public Prosecutor s Office, the charges against Mr. Rahmani Shastan were
    being an important member of Peykar, a rebel, an enemy of God, a
    corruptor, and an apostate. According to his mother, the judicial and
    security officials never mentioned her son s charges or reason for his
    arrest during her several approaches. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rahmani
    Shastan's defense. He was denied the right to have an attorney. Judgment
    َThe Central Islamic Revolutionary Court identified Mr. Rahmani Shastan
    "an enemy of God and the prophet." He was condemned to death and executed
    in Evin prison on June 21, 1981 at 9 pm. Seven other individuals were
    executed that day whose names were not known.
