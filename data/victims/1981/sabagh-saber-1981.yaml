    The execution of Mr. Saber Sabagh was reported in the July 13th, 1981
    issue of Jomhuri-e Eslami daily. Mr. Sabagh (Mojahedin Khalq Organization)
    is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adopted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary, and they believed in an armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive economic and social analysis
    method but considered Islam their source of inspiration, culture, and
    ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many members were
    imprisoned and executed. In 1975 following a profound ideological crisis,
    the organization refuted Islam as its ideology, and after a few of its
    members were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization
    proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to the split of the
    Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January 1979, the
    imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with other
    political prisoners. They began re-organizing the MKO and recruiting new
    members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities. Still, its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were vehemently
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial According to the newspaper report, Mr. Sabagh refused to reveal his
    identity during his detention and trial. No further information is
    available about this trial. Charges The report specifies that Mr. Sabagh
    and the four other convicts were charged with "threatening and
    intimidating Muslim people," "insulting the combatant clergy and the
    Islamic Republic," "repeated clashes with the people," "disseminating
    rumors and organizing demonstrations in favor of the impeached President
    Bani-Sadr, which demonstrations resulted in burning tires and throwing
    stones at security forces," "organizing secret political gatherings and
    team houses," "disturbing the mind of the youth by misleading them with
    wrong ideas," "distributing political leaflets and posters," "defending
    the political ideas of the People's Mojahedin Organization,"
    "participating in disarming Revolutionary Guard brothers, and consistently
    opposing the Islamic Revolution." Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Sabagh's
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Behshahr found Mr.
    Sabagh guilty of "corruption on earth" and "rebellion against God and the
    People". He was executed at dawn on July 12, 1981.
    ------------------------------- * The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretations of Islam, widened the gap between them. Authorities of the
    new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the authorities called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown, but many demonstrators were
    arrested and executed in the following days and weeks. The day after the
    demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a repressive campaign
    unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and
    sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO
    announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and assassinated
    several high-ranking officials and supporters of the Islamic regime. In
    the summer of 1981, the leader
