    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan Baghjafi, son of Karbala Alikhan and

    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian

    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.

    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
