    News of the execution of Mr. Davud Dehqan Aqilabadi, son of Mostafa, along
    with fourteen others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on
    August 31, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central
    Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor’s Office issued an announcement about
    these executions, defendants’ names and their charges, and released it to
    the media. Additional information was sent by a friend of the defendant
    through an electronic form to the Omid site. According to this form, Mr.
    Davud Dehqan Aqilabadi was born in 1950. He was a student in Sweden and a
    sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. Mr. Davud Dehqan Aqilabadi is one
    of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on
    the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr. Davud
    Dehqan Aqilabadi is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to the above announcement, the charges against Mr. Davud Dehqan
    Aqilabadi were announced as, “residence in an organizational house,
    logistical assistance in the Service Committee of the Peykar Organization,
    stealing innocent people’s properties, and being in charge of repairing
    publishing and copy machines.” The announcement also mentioned that these
    people “worked full time and underground for the hellish organization of
    Peykar and received salaries from this organization.” Additional charges
    of “plotting and armed uprising against the Islamic Revolution and
    innocent people” were mentioned for 15 individuals including the
    defendant. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Davud Dehqan Aqilabadi’s
    defense. Judgment َThe Central Islamic Revolutionary Court identified Mr.
    Davud Dehqan Aqilabadi as “at war with God and the Prophet, rebel, and a
    corruptor on earth.” He was condemned to death. The ruling was carried out
    on August 29, 1981. No exact information is available about the details of
    the court verdict.
