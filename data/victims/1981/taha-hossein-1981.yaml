    Mr. Hossein Taha is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge brought against the defendant is
    not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Taha’s defense. Judgment There is no
    information on the verdict leading to this execution. *In the summer of
    1981, the leader of the MKO and the impeached President (Banisadr) fled
    Iran to reside in France, where they founded the National Council of
    Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many of its members were expelled
    from France, they went to Iraq and founded the National Liberation Army of
    Iran in 1987, which entered Iranian territory a few times during the
    Iran-Iraq war. They were defeated in July 1988 during their last
    operation, the Forugh Javidan Operation. A few days after this operation,
    thousands of imprisoned Mojahedin supporters were killed during the mass
    executions of political prisoners in 1988. Ever since the summer of 1981,
    the MKO has continued its activities outside of Iran. No information is
    available regarding members and activities of the MKO inside the country.
    In defense: In spite of the “armed struggle” announcement by the MKO on
    June 20, 1981, many sympathizers of the organization had no military
    training, were not armed, and did not participate in armed conflict.
