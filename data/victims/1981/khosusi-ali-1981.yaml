    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Khosusi, along with twenty-two others,
    was published in the Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on July 19,
    1981, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Public and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor’s Office of the Islamic Republic. Mr. Khosusi is one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According
    to this source, Mr. Khosusi was a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan
    Organization. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin
    America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic
    Republic and was active mainly in the political arena and the labor
    movement. Arrest and detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Tehran tried Mr. Khosusi. Charges The charges against Mr. Ali Khosusi were
    announced as “membership in the Marxist organization of Fadaiyan Khalq
    Minority, acting against the Islamic Republic, activity and leadership in
    a team house, registering membership and encouraging ignorant people to
    join [the organization], and committing anti-people acts against the
    Islamic Republic.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    did not provide any specific information on the evidence presented against
    the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Khosusi's
    defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran identified
    Mr. Khosusi as "a corruptor on earth, at war with God and a rebel." He was
    condemned to death. The ruling was carried out when he was executed by
    firing squad in the Evin prison on July 5, 1981.
