    In 1976, Mr. Hushang Montazerolzohur won the Iranian championship title in
    Greco Roman wrestling, and as a light-heavyweight, he participated in the
    1976 Montreal Olympic games along with the Iranian national team.
    Information about the execution of Mr. Hushang Montazerolzohur, son of
    Haydar, was obtained from two electronic forms (June 4, 2009, and March 2,
    2022) and correspondence between one of his relatives with Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center (March 13, 2022). News of the execution of Mr. Hushang
    Montazaerolzohur, along with 65 other people, was published in a
    communique from the Office of Public Information of the Chief Public
    Prosecutor of the Islamic Republic, in Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on October
    4, 1981. That same day, this news item was also published in Kayhan
    newspaper (October 4, 1981). Additional information on this case was
    collected from BBC Persian website (September 16, 2020) and Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization website (February 27, 2007). Mr. Montazerolzohur was
    born in the Shemiran area of Tehran in September 1951. His family were
    from Khomeini Shahr (Homayun Shahr at the time), Esfahan. Mr.
    Montazerolzohur liked to study and participate in sports since childhood.
    His father worked for Tehran municipality until he retired in 1970, and in
    order to take care of his family s properties and to farm the lands, he
    took his family back to Esfahan. Mr. Montazerolzohur helped his father in
    this endeavor. Around that time, he got his high school diploma in Natural
    Sciences. He then took the Higher Education Entrance Exams, was accepted
    to German Language Studies, and went back to Tehran. In order to pay for
    his education, he drove a taxi at night, while attending classes during
    the day. Eventually, because of financial difficulties, he dropped out of
    Tehran University and returned to Esfahan. After a while, Mr.
    Montazerolzohur was accepted to Esfahan University to study Physical
    Education, and he graduated from that program (Correspondence with a
    relative, March 13, 2022; Mojahedin e Khalq Organization website, February
    27, 2007). In 1976, Mr. Montazerolzohur won the Iranian championship title
    in Greco Roman wrestling, and as a light- heavyweight, he participated in
    the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games along with the Iranian national team. One
    year later, he was sent to Sofia, Bulgaria, in order to participate in the
    International Student Championship Games. After he returned from Sofia,
    concurrent with the peak of political demonstrations against the former
    regime, Mr. Montazerolzohur entered the military and served as a
    noncommissioned officer (Mojahedin e Khalq Organization website, February
    27, 2007(. In 1981, Mr. Montazerolzohur participated in the National
    Championship Games in Yazd, and he won the middle-heavyweight title (BBC
    Farsi, September 16, 2020). After the 1979 revolution, Mr. Montazerolzohur
    was employed as a coach at Esfahan University, and later on, he was
    elected Head of Physical Education at Esfahan University. According to the
    Mojahedin e Khalq website, during the period when the universities were
    shut down because of the Cultural Revolution, an incident occurred one
    day, while the Esfahan University soccer team were practicing. The vice
    chancellor at the time made obscene remarks to the players that day, and
    got into a verbally abusive exchange with Mr. Montazerolzohur, following
    which he was suspended for a month and a half (Mojahedin e Khalq
    Organization, February 27, 2007). According to one of his relatives, Mr.
    Montazerolzohur had no organizational or party affiliation, but according
    to some sources, he was a supporter of Mojahedin e Khalq Organization
    (Mojahedin e Khalq Organization website, February 27, 2007; Electronic
    form, June 4, 2009). One of his relatives compared Mr. Montazerolzohur s
    sportsmanship to Gholamreza Takhti, the famous former wrestling champion
    of Iran. They said he was one of the best sports educators and one of the
    educated athletes and a champion of his time in his country and on the
    National Iranian Team (Correspondence with a relative, March 13, 2022).
    Arrest and detention Mr. Hushang Montazerolzohur was arrested by the
    revolutionary guards, before midnight on August 15, 1981, at his family
    home in Esfahan. There was no arrest warrant and no reason or explanation
    was given. According to the source of information, he was subjected to
    severe torture during the 47 days of his detention (Correspondence with a
    relative, March 13, 2022; Electronic form, June 4, 2009; March 2, 2022).
    For six weeks, Mr. Montazerolzohur s family would go to the revolutionary
    guard s office on Kamal Esmai l Street in Esfahan. The officials offered
    no help other than giving them unrealistic promises about his release
    (Correspondence with a relative, March 13, 2022). Trial According to
    available information, Mr. Montazerolzohur was tried on October 1, 1981,
    in the same place where he was being held. He was blindfolded (Electronic
    form, March 2, 2022). At the trial and prior to the tr
