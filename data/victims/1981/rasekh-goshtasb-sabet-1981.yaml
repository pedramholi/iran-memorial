    was killed extrajudicially, only because he was a Baha i. The news of the
    extrajudicial death of Mr. Goshtasb Sabet Rasekh (also spelled "Gushtasb
    Thabit-Rasikh") long with four other people, was obtained through
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interviews with an informed person on March
    18, 2012 (ABC interview). Additional information in this regard was
    obtained through Archives of Baha i s Persecution in Iran s website (ABPI
    website). Mr. Sabet Rasekh is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a
    1993 report published by the Baha i International Community. The report
    documents the persecution of the members of the Faith in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1979. Mr. Sabet Rasekh
    was born in 1951 in the village of Chigan, Faridan County, Esfahan
    Province. He was married with two children and worked as a farmer. Mr.
    Sabet Rasekh was a Baha i, serving as a member of the local Baha i youth
    committee of the village of Chigan. Shortly after the Islamic revolution
    in 1979, the persecution against the Baha is of Chigan was intensified. He
    and most of the Baha is of Chigan were forced to flee their village and
    move to Esfahan (ABPI website). The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected
    the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest
    religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979*- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.** Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the time
    of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified and
    institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah
    Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain instances,
    even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to Iran, in
    response to a question regarding political and religious freedom of Baha
    is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated:
    They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They will
    not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they be
    free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). After being detained, Mr. Sabet Rasekh was
    severely tortured. Arrest and detention On August 16, 1981, Mr. Sabet
    Rasekh was arrested in his home in the city of Esfahan. The following day,
    he was transferred to Daran Prison, located 150 kilometers south of
    Esfahan. According to available information, after being detained, Mr.
    Sabet Rasekh was severely tortured. He did not have access to a lawyer
    during his detention (ABPI website). Trial According to available
    information, no court session was held to try Mr. Sabet Rasekh. Mr. Sabet
    Rasekh s sole charge was believing in the Baha i religion . Charges
    According to the interviewee, Mr. Sabet Rasekh s sole charge was believing
    in the Baha i religion (ABC interview). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Sabet Rasekh. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Sabet Rasekh s defense. The representatives of the Baha i
    community stress that their members are being persecuted for their
    religious beliefs. They note that Baha is requests to access their files
    are usually denied, and access to attorneys is often denied. However, the
    representatives of the Baha i community stress that their members are
    being persecuted for their religious beliefs. They note that Baha is
    requests to access their files are usually denied, and access to attorneys
    is often denied. They refute the validity of charges such as
    counter-revolutionary political activities or spying leveled against them
    in Iranian courts. They point out that the fundamental principles of their
    religion require them to show loyalty and obedience to their government
    and refrain from any political involvement. They believe that the
    accusation of espionage for Israel is unfounded and based solely on the
    fact that the Baha i World Centre is in Israel. They point out that this
    Center was established on Mount Carmel in the late 19th century, long
    before the establishment of the State of Israel. Shortly after Mr. Sabet
