    The information about the execution of Mr. Morteza (Yusef) Mojtabavi, a
    member of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO), and 37 other individuals
    was released in a communiqu of the Tehran Public Prosecutor s Office,
    published in the newspaper Kayhan on August 24, 1981. Further information
    was sent to Omid via an electronic form by Mr. Mojtabavi s brother. Mr.
    Mojtabavi is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention According to the form, a witness saw Mr.
    Mojtabavi being arrested at the Shariati Park in the August of 1981. He
    was detained at the Evin Prison for two weeks and his family was not
    informed of the location of his detention until after his execution. There
    is no mention of legal representation for Mr. Mojtabavi while in
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Based on the Public Prosecutor s office Mr. Mojtabavi s was
    charged as follows, being an active member of the hypocrites Organization
    (the MKO), and being in charge of 30 people in the military and
    preparatory wing of the Organization in the south of Tehran. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Mojtabavi's defense. Judgment Mr.
    Mojtabavi was sentenced to death and his sentence was carried out at the
    Evin Prison at the night of August 23, 1981. According to the form his
    name was announced as one of the executed in the afternoon television news
    program under the pseudonym Yusef Mojtabavi . The authorities did not
    return his body to his family and only informed them of the location of
    his burial. _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981,
