    The news of the execution of Mr. Heidar (Ali Reza) Orian Abkenar was
    published in the Jomhouri Eslami newspaper on October 21, 1981.
    Supplemental information about Mr. Orian Abkenar was sent to the Boroumand
    Foundation via an electronic form by a person informed about this case.
    Mr. Orian Abkenar, son of Rahim, was born in Abkenar in 1960. He was a
    high school graduate and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. During the revolution, he was active in Abkenar and Bandar-e
    Anzali. After the revolution, he played a significant role among the
    Mojahedin in fighting against the Revolutionary Guards during the armed
    operation of Ghazian Bridge in Bandar-e Anzali. According to this
    information, despite his young age, Mr. Orian Abkenar was respected by all
    the leftist political groups, including the Mojahedin, and although he
    could have left the country, he stayed to continue the fight. Mr. Orian
    Abkenar is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed , magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention According to the information sent by the
    electronic form, Mr. Orian Abkenar was arrested in July 1981 after being
    identified in one of neighborhoods around Abkenar. Trial No information is
    available on the Mr. Orian Abkenar s trial. Charges According to the
    information sent by the electronic form, the charges against Mr. Orian
    Abkenar were announced as armed opposition to the Islamic Republic,
    membership in the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, and possession of several
    light and heavy weapons. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against Mr. Orian Abkenar cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Orian Abkenar. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Orian Abkenar s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Gilan tried Mr. Orian Abkenar, as one of the victims of the American
    imperialism, and sentenced him to death for armed opposition to the
    Islamic Republic regime, creation of fear and terror, being a corruptor on
    the earth, and waging a war against God. ( Jomhouri Eslami newspaper).
    Based on the Jomhouri Eslami newspaper and the addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine, Mr. Orian Abkenar was executed at the midnight of October 20,
    1981 in Bandar-e Anzali. According to the information provided in the
    electronic form, however, he was executed by a firing squad shortly after
    his arrest in July 1981 and his bloody shirt was given to his family. *
    The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of
    their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic
    Republic authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap
    between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin
    as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
