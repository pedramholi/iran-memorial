    arms, Molotov Cocktails, and grenades in order to fight the regime of the
    Islamic Revolution and plotting to overthrow the regime, participation in
    causing fire, participation in an attempt to assassinate a Muslim brother,
    believing in overthrowing Islamic governance, and collecting monetary aid

    executed on December 29, 1981 in Yazd. He was 19 years old.
