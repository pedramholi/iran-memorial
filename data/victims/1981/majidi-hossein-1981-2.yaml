    He was almost a kid, though already gifted in assembling electronics. In
    politics, his extended family were allies of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. (Even his grandparents got arrested.) The information
    related to the case of Mr. Hossein Majidi, high school student and a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO),* was drawn from the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation s interview with one of his close
    relatives. This interview took place in London (United Kingdom), on
    February 7th, 2011. Mr. Hossein Majidi grew up in a politically active
    family. After the 1979 victory of Iran s Islamic Revolution, Hossein
    Majidi became a sympathizer of the MKO and actively supported its agenda.
    Mr. Majidi s activities consisted of participating in small demonstrations
    organized by a few MKO sympathizers at the district level, at which he
    distributed the MKO s leaflets and other publications. With the growing
    restriction on freedom of expression and freedom of assembly in Iran
    between 1979 and 1981, these demonstrations were regularly countered by
    pro-government vigilantes (Hezbollah militants) and would often end up in
    a violent brawl. According to Mr. Majidi s relative, before June 20th,
    1981, Hossein had been identified by the revolutionary authorities of his
    district and had been arrested for participating in demonstrations and
    distributing the MKO s literature. He had been released a few hours later
    at the behest of his parents who had promised the revolutionary
    authorities that he would refrain from demonstrating in the future. In the
    wake of the June 21, 1981, mass demonstration, political repression
    intensified in Iran. Hossein Majidi s relatives, including his aunts
    Mehrangiz and Soheila Mohammad-Rahimi and his uncles Ebrahim, Hushang,
    Aziz, and Manouchehr Mohammad-Rahimi along with his grandparents Mr. and
    Ms. Mohammad-Rahimi were arrested. Aziz was executed a few weeks later, on
    August 17th, 1981. After many years in detention, Soheila, Mehrangiz and
    Hushang were also executed. Ebrahim, Manouchehr and their parents survived
    political persecution. The stories of Hushang, Aziz, Soheila and Mehrangiz
    Mohammad-Rahimi are documented in Omid, A Memorial in Defense of Human
    Rights . Hossein Majidi s relatives remember him as a very kind and quiet
    child. He was interested in electrical engineering and electronics. As a
    hobby he used to make electrical tools and he made a walkie-talkie all by
    himself. Hossein s dream was to graduate from high school and enroll in
    Tehran University to study electrical engineering. Arrest and detention
    Hossein Majidi was arrested in mid-September 1981 at his home on Bella s
    street, in the Farahabad s Khazaneh district in Tehran. He was 15 at the
    time of his arrest. Agents of the Islamic Revolutionary Committee of the
    Khazaneh district were mandated by the Islamic Revolutionary Committee of
    Naziabad district to arrest him. Mr. Majidi s parents, however, were not
    shown any written arrest warrant. They inspected the house, took Hossein s
    books, and interrogated his parents about his activities and his school.
    They told Hossein s parents that they were taking him to ask him a few
    questions and would bring him back in a few hours. Based on the
    information gathered by Hossein s detained relatives at Evin Prison, after
    his arrest he was transferred to Evin Prison. Several MKO members, who
    were under interrogation at the time in the interrogation section of Evin
    Prison had seen Hossein Majidi and told his uncles that he was under
    interrogation there. According to these witnesses, Hossein had been
    severely tortured and was in a very worrying state. He spent a month under
    interrogation at Evin Prison. Trial According to Mr. Majidi s relative, he
    died while under interrogation as a result of the severe torture he
    endured. There is no indication from the Islamic Republic s Judiciary or
    from Evin Prison s authorities that Mr. Majidi was ever tried. Charges
    There is no information regarding the charges leveled against Mr. Majidi.
    However his sympathy for and activities in favor of the MKO are believed
    to have been the cause of his arrest. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    death in detention does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Majidi s defense. It is worth noting however that in spite of the "armed
    struggle" announcement by the MKO on June 20, 1981, many sympathizers of
    the organization had no military training, were not armed, and did not
    participate in armed conflict. Judgment There is no evidence that Mr.
    Hossein Majidi was ever tried or that any verdict was ever issued
    regarding his case. According to his relative, for a long time his parents
    kept going to Evin Prison to inquire about their son, only to hear the
    prison authorities deny that anyone by the name of Hossein Majidi was ever
    detained in Evin Prison. For several years any and all information
    regarding the fate of their son was withheld fr
