    The information about the execution of Mr. Majid Shafa'i was released in a
    communiqu from the Esfahan Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal, published in
    the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on September 30, 1981. Additional information
    about Mr. Majid Shafa'i was obtained from the website of Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. He was a high school student majoring in math when he became
    a sympathizer of Mojahedin Khalq Organization, like his parents. He joined
    the organization and began selling its publication. He also acted as a
    courier for the organization transferring documents. His parents were
    executed with him. This execution was also reported in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Mr. Majid Shafa'i was 16 years old when executed. According
    to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and also the
    Covenant on Child Rights, persons below 18 years of age at the time of the
    commission of the crime shall not be sentenced to death. Iran is legally
    bound to these international laws. Amnesty International has repeatedly
    asked the judiciary officials in Iran to stop executing children and young
    people under the age of 18, and to conform Iranian laws to international
    standards of Human Rights. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention No details are
    available on Mr. Majid Shafa'i's arrest and detention. According to the
    web site of Mojahedin Khalq, he was arrested during a visit to Esfahan in
    the summer of 1981. When his body was taken to the cemetery, many torture
    marks were evident. Trial No information is available on the defendant s
    trial. Charges Mr. Shafa'i was accused of "being a member of the armed
    wing of the People's Mojahedin Organization...participating in armed
    action against the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as terrorizing and
    murdering attacking the revolutionary guard and the Basij dormitories,
    throwing both Molotov cocktails and three way explosives in public places,
    [aiming] at the cars and shops of revolutionary guards and those of the
    Basij and Hezbollahi people." The charges brought against him, along with
    52 other victims, are collective and general. The prosecution mentions no
    specific offense for any particular individual. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Shafa'i's defense.
    Judgment Mr. Shafa i was found guilty of "armed rebellion against the
    Islamic Republic" and sentenced to death. He was executed with his parents
    on Sunday night, September 27, 1981. -------------------------------- *The
    exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of their
    centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic
    authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the
    two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites
    and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin
    sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while distributing
    publications, lead
