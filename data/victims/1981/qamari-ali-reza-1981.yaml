    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Reza Qamari, son of Esma'il, along with
    eighteen others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on September 19,
    1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor’s
    Office issued an announcement concerning these executions, the defendants'
    names, and their charges, and released it to the Pars news agency. Mr.
    Qamari is also one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list
    of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. Moreover, he is
    among the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6,
    1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. According to the report, Mr. Qamari was an experienced member of
    the Peykar Organization in Baluchestan. He was a technician working in the
    Baft-e Baluch textile factory in Iranshahr (in the south eastern province
    of Sistan and Baluchestan). The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Qamari were announced as "membership in the hellish
    organization of Peykar, membership in a committee of the organization, and
    armed action against Islam and Moslems." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Qamari's defense. Judgment َThe Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Court identified Mr. Qamari "an enemy of God and His Prophet
    and a corruptor on earth." He was condemned to death, and executed in Evin
    prison on September 19, 1981. He was 25 years old.
