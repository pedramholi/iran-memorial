    Mr. Ahmad Azizpur, Sympathizer of Mojahedin Khalq Organization is one of
    the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The news of the
    execution of Mr. Azizpur and 13 other individuals was announced in a
    communiqué by the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office published in
    Kayhan and Jomhouri Eslami newspapers on August 25, 1981. In this
    communiqué the executed individuals are referred to as “hacks of the
    criminal U.S. imperialism.” The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members’ interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah’s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization’s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Azizpur’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial There is no
    specific information regarding Mr. Azizpur’s trial. Charges According to
    the communiqué of Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office, Mr. Azizpur
    was charged with “rebelling against the Islamic Republic.” In addition,
    along with six other individuals, he was charged with “membership in armed
    branches, responsibility for councils, forming a thirty-person group
    composed of five strike and destruction teams, planning seventeen
    explosions, eight of which have materialized, following and identifying
    people, stealing automobiles in order to transport weapons and explosives,
    hiding the armed wing of the organization, protecting information and
    communications, and providing anything necessary to overthrow and weaken
    the regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran.” It was not clear which one of
    the above charges specifically applied to Mr. Azizpur, and the date and
    location of the explosions attributed to him was not mentioned in this
    communiqué. The validity of the criminal charges brought against Mr.
    Azizpur cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a
    fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against Mr. Azizpur. Defense No information is
    available concerning Mr. Azizpur’s defense. Judgment The Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal found Mr. Azizpur to be “waging war against God and
    the Prophet, a corrupter on earth, and a rebel,” and sentenced him to
    death. He was executed by a firing squad on August 23, 1981.
    __________________________________________________________________ *The
    exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of their
    centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic
    authorities’ different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between
    the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as
    “Hypocrites” and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
    treatment by governmental officials and the government officials’ efforts
    to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact
    that the regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and
    Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from this
    demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were arrested
    and executed i
