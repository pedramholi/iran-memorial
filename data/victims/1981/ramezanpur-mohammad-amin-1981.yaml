    Mr. Mohammadamin Ramezanpur is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Further information was sent to the
    Omid website through an electronic form by a relative of the victim. Mr.
    Mohammadamin Ramezanpur was born to a middle-class family in Bandar Abbas
    in 1959. His father’s name was Ramezan. He graduated from a technical high
    school and was a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization with atheist
    beliefs. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges According to the information of the
    electronic form, the charges against Mr. Mohammadamin Ramezanpur were
    announced as, “Moharebeh (fighting) against God and the Occult Imam, and
    cooperation with the anti-revolutionary groups.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mohammadamin Ramezanpur's defense. Judgment According to
    the information of the electronic form, Mr. Mohammadamin Ramezanpur was
    executed in Bandar Abbas in September 1981. No specific information is
    available about the defendant’s execution.
