    The information about the execution of Mr. Hamid Mohabat Kar, a follower
    of the People s Mojahedin Organization, and 52 other individuals was
    released in a communiqu of the Esfahan Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal,
    published in the newspaper Jomhuri Eslami , September 30, 1981.
    Information about Mr. Mohabat Kar s arrest was sent to Omid via an
    electronic form by a person familiar with the case. This execution was
    also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published
    by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes 12028
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention According
    to the information present on the electronic form, Mr. Mohabat Kar was
    arrested when passing out pamphlets for the People s Mojahedin
    Organization and was not allowed visitation with his family while he was
    held in detention. Further circumstances of his arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial Based on the electronic form, Mr. Mohabat Kar did not
    have a trial. Charges Mr. Mohabat Kar was accused of "being a member of
    the armed wing of the People's Mojahedin Organization... armed action
    against the Islamic Republic of Iran, terror, murder and attacking the
    Revolutionary Guard and Basij brothers, attacking the Basij dormitories,
    throwing Molotov cocktails and three ways [explosives] in public places,
    [aiming] cars and shops of the revolutionary guards, Basij and the
    Hezbollahi people." These charges are collective and brought against the
    defendant and 52 other individuals. The prosecution does not mention any
    specific offense for the defendant. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohabat
    Kar's defense. Judgment He was found guilty of "armed rebellion against
    the Islamic Republic" and sentenced to death. He was executed on Sunday
    night, September 27th. _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO
    members from government offices and the closure of their centers and
    publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities
    different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two.
    Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and
    the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin
    sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while distributing
    publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20,
    1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by
    governmental officials and the government officials efforts to impeach
    their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the
    regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets,
    some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The
    number of casualties that resulted from this demonstration is unknown but
    a large number of demonstrators were arrested and executed in the
    following days and weeks. The day after the demonstration, the Islamic
    Republic regime started a repressive campaign unprecedented in modern
    Iranian hi
