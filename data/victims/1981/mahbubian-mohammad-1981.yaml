    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Mahbubian, son of Nematollah, and 65
    other individuals, was published on October 4, 1981 in Kayhan daily
    newspaper, and [in a report containing the names of] 29 individuals, in
    Jomhuri Eslami daily newspaper, both newspapers quoting the announcement
    of the Office of Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor
    General s Office. The names and crimes of the accused have been stated in
    this announcement. Additional information about Mr. Mahbubian was sent to
    the Boroumand Foundation via electronic form by a person close to him.
    News of this execution was also reported in Peykar publication number 126,
    dated Monday, November 9, 1981. Mr Mahbubian is one of the 430 individuals
    whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh
    va Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the
    organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the
    individuals on this list have been executed. In addition, Mr. Mahbubian is
    one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According
    to available information, Mr. Mahbubian was 27 years old and single, had a
    two-year college degree, and was born in the city of Shahreza, Esfahan, to
    a middle class family. Under the Shah s regime, he was jailed for
    political activities with a religious group and was freed in 1979. Upon
    his release, he was active with Razmandegan Organization and was also
    working at Disman factory and Sherkat e Gostaresh e Esfahan ( Esfahan
    Development Corporation. ) After a schism occurred in Razmandegan
    Organization, he joined Peykar Organization. The Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of Mr. Mohammad Mahbubian s arrest and detention are not
    known. According to the information contained in the Peykar publication,
    Mr. Mahbubian was arrested three times: Once during labor struggles,
    another time during May Day (labor) celebrations (on May 1) and was
    released after a month, and the last time, in late September 1981, by
    government agents at his home. Trial According to the announcement of the
    Office of Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General
    s Office, the Esfahan Revolutionary Court has issued the decision in the
    case of Mr. Mahbubian and 29 other individuals. Charges According to the
    announcement of the Office of Public Relations of the Islamic
    Revolutionary General Prosecutor s Office, the charges against Mr.
    Mahbubian and 29 others have been stated as being conspiring and acting
    against the Islamic Republic, Participating in armed conflicts in the
    streets, membership and active support of the puppet mini-group
    Monafeghin, approval of the armed conflict policy, belief in the overthrow
    of Islamic government, distributing banned publications, deviating and
    misleading the youth. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Mahbubian. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mahbubian s defense.
    Judgment The Esfahan Islamic Revolutionary Court declared Mr. Mahbubian
    Mofsed e fel arz ( One who spreads Corruption on Earth, ) Mohareb ( One
    who wages war with God, ) and Baqi upon Islamic rule ( One who has turned
    against Islam ) and sentenced him to death. The sentence was carried out
    on October 2, 1981 in Esfahan, and he was shot by a firing squad. Mr.
    Mahbubian was 27 years old.
