    The information about Mr. Abdolhamid (Reza) Zereshke i, son of Abdolahad,
    is based on an interview with a person close to him. Additionally, he is
    one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No. 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985.
    The list includes individuals affiliated with various opposition groups,
    who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic
    security forces from June 1981 until the publication date of the magazine.
    His execution was announced in a communiqu of the public relations
    department of the national prosecution office, in which his last name was
    mistyped as Zereshki. The communiqu was printed in the Kayhan newspaper on
    September 23, 1981. The communiqu begins with this verse of the Quran: And
    there is life for you in retaliation, O men of understanding [II: 179].
    Mr. Zereshke i was born in 1960 in Borujerd, in the western province of
    Lorestan. He was a chemistry student at Tehran University and a
    sympathizer of the Razmandegan Organization. He was a brilliant student
    and scored among the top first hundred high school graduates in the
    National Exam for entering higher education. During the Cultural
    Revolution, when many non-Islamic students and professors were purged from
    universities, he was expelled from Tehran University in 1980. The
    Razmandegan Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded in the winter of 1979. Its activities were focused on the working
    class and factories. The founding tenets of Razmandegan included the
    rejection of armed struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet
    policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. It viewed the Soviet Union as a
    Social imperialist state and believed that China had deviated from
    Marxist-Leninist principles. Razmandegan was among the groups that became
    known as Khat-e Se (Third line). By early 1981, disagreements on the Party
    s position on the Iran-Iraq war caused internal splits in Razmandegan.
    These splits, which coincided with the massive and brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government, caused the organization to disband.
    The Cultural Revolution began after Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech in
    March 1980 and ordered that universities be purged of all those who
    opposed his regime and be transformed into learning environments [as
    opposed to political forums] where an all-Islamic curriculum would be
    taught. The first wave of violence began on April 15, 1980 during a speech
    by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic
    Revolution and Minister of Interior] at the University of Tabriz.
    Following the speech, students supporting the regime took control of the
    University s central building and demanded that the university be purged
    from pro-Shah elements and other sellouts. On April 18, the Council of the
    Islamic Revolution issued a communiqu accusing political groups of
    converting higher education institutions into headquarters of discordant
    political activities and naming them as obstacles to the radical
    transformation of the universities. The communiqu gave these groups three
    days (Saturday April 19 to Monday April 21) to shut down their activities
    in the universities. The Council stressed that the decision included
    libraries along with activities related to arts and sports. Political
    groups, which recruited members and had strong support in the
    universities, refused to evacuate. Before the Council s deadline, serious
    clashes took place between leftist groups and Islamist Associations, which
    were at times supported by security forces and paramilitary groups. These
    clashes, which peaked at the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in
    the death of several people and hundreds of others were wounded at
    university campuses around the country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic
    authorities announced the victory of the Cultural Revolution and the
    closure of all universities in order to Islamicize the curricula. The
    universities remained closed for two years. One of the outcomes of the
    Cultural Revolution was the purging of many university professors and
    students based on their political beliefs. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Zereshke i was arrested on a street in Borujerd in the summer of 1981
    after a meeting and was transferred to prison by the RevolutionaryGuards.
    After his arrest, the Guards went to his home and searched everywhere for
    documents. Because his father was a well-known man, his family was soon
    able to visit him. They visited him three times during his 40 day
    detention. The city s Friday Imam told Mr. Zereshke i s father that he
    soon would be released and that there is no problem. But he had to give
    five names to his interrogator and he refused to do so. His father asked
    the Imam if he could give his name, his mother and sisters names instead
    and the Imam told him that he would see what he could do. During a visit,
    his father told him, don t worry, you will be free. Mr. Zereshke i
    replied, No, they will kill us a
