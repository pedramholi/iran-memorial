    The information about the execution of Ms. Ameneh Malek Afzali and another
    individual was released in a report by the Babol Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal and published in the Kayhan newspaper on July 19, 1981. Ms. Malek
    Afzali is also one of the 1,533 executed prisoners listed by the
    Association of Iranian Women of Köln (Germany). The list was published on
    September 10, 1997 and is entitled: "A Partial List of Women Executed by
    the Islamic Republic of Iran.” This list has been updated by former
    political prisoners living in various countries. Furthermore, this
    execution was reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) in 1985. The list
    includes 12028 individuals affiliated with various opposition groups who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Additional
    information about Ms. Malek Afzali is taken from the MKO website. She was
    born in a village close to Qa'emshahr in the province of Mazandaran. She
    was a high school student when she became a MKO sympathizer. She was
    active in anti-regime demonstrations during 1980 and 1981. Arrest and
    detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and
    detention. According to the MKO website, Ms. Malek Afzali was arrested in
    May 1981. During her two-month detention, she was reportedly tortured so
    severely that she had to be taken to the hospital. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to the Babol Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal’s report, Ms. Malek Afzali was charged with “active
    participation in clashes in this city [Babol], leading clashes and
    disturbing the peace, causing disorder at the Azarm High School in Babol,
    demolishing an office at the high school and breaking the window panes in
    the office and classrooms, beating and wounding a teacher during a fight,
    performing marked activities to promote the Mojahedin Organization’s armed
    struggle against the Islamic Republic of Iran.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms. Malek Afzali's
    defense. Judgment No specific information is available about this
    execution. Based on the newspaper report, Babol’s Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal sentenced Ms. Malek Afzali to death and this sentence was
    confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council. She was executed at 4:30 pm in
    Babol on July 18, 1981.
