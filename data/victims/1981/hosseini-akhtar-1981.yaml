circumstances: >
    The execution of Ms. Akhtar Hosseini, daughter of Seyed Hadi, along with
    two other individuals was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on June 27,
    1981. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial other than she was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Kermanshah. Charges There is no exact information on the
    personal charges brought against her. The news story mentions the
    collective charge against her and two other individuals as “adultery,
    sodomy, and counter-Revolutionary activities.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms.
    Hosseini's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Kermanshah condemned Ms. Akhtar Hosseini to death. She was executed on
    June 25, 1981 at Dizel Abad prison.
