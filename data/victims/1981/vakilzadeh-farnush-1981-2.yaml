    The information about Mr. Farnush Vakilzadeh has been drawn from an
    interview with a relative. His execution was reported by the correspondent
    of the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Shiraz (July 8, 1981). Following the news,
    a communiqué of the Public Relations office of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Guard Headquarters of Shiraz was published. The communiqué begins as
    follows: “The storming rage of our Muslim nation that is a token of God’s
    rage becomes more roaring and throbbing by the day. This nation is
    determined, more than ever before, to do away with those who are dependant
    on and affiliated with the East or the West, despite the conspiracies that
    try to disappoint it and push it away from the public sphere.” Mr.
    Vakilzadeh worked as a driver. The interviewee remembers him as a
    freedom-loving person, who was “honest, loving and caring,” who “loved to
    spend time with his nieces and nephews.” Those close to him, remember that
    he loved an Iranian dish prepared with pomegranate paste. Mr. Vakilzadeh
    was last seen the nigh before his arrest when he had taken his nieces and
    nephews to have some hamburgers. According to the newspaper report, Mr.
    Vakilzadeh was affiliated with the Communist Combatants’ Union (“Ettehad-e
    Mobarezan-e Komonist” or Sahand). This Organization was founded after the
    Islamic Revolution of February 1979, with a specific focus on ideology.
    After Sahand developed the project of the Communist Party of Iran in 1982,
    and the Party was founded by Sahand and Komala and remainders of such
    Communist organizations as Peykar, Razmandegan, and some affiliates of the
    Fadaiyan Khalq. Komala in Kurdistan became the center of the Communist
    Party of Iran, whose main publication was the Communist monthly magazine.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Vakilzadeh was arrested the night of June 27,
    1981, as he was returning home, which was already surrounded by state
    officials. His sister, who had invited him for lunch the next day, started
    a search in hospitals and police stations when he did not show up for
    lunch. On June 29, his name was found in the Shiraz prison and his family
    was told that he was undergoing interrogation and hence they could not
    visit him until the end of interrogations. During the 7 days of detention,
    Mr. Vakilzadeh was tortured and his body and fingernails were bruised.
    Trial According to the available information, Mr. Vakilzadeh was not
    tried. Charges The authorities told Mr. Vakilzadeh’s family that he was
    silent and did not disclose the identity of any of his accomplices.
    However, the communiqué of the Revolutionary Guards Corps stated that he
    was a member of the “Communist Combatants Union” and listed his charges as
    follows: “keeping and distributing communist leaflets”, “having
    connections to the dissolved Komala party”, “declaring armed uprising
    against the Islamic sovereign”, and “owning a safe house and equipment for
    printing and copying the infidels’ leaflets.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. The interviewee stated that there were one of two boxes of
    leaflets in his house; no further information is available. Defense No
    information is available concerning Mr. Vakilzadeh’s defense. Judgment The
    communiqué of the Revolutionary Guards of Shiraz stated that “in
    accordance with the verdict of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Shiraz, [Mr.] Farnush Vakilzadeh… was at war with God and his Prophet and
    a corruptor on earth”; however the interviewee asserted that there was no
    court verdict. According to available information, Mr. Vakilzadeh’s family
    was told to go to the prison to see him on July 6, 1981. His family
    members were led to the back door of the prison where Mr. Vakilzadeh’s
    body was returned to them. Mr. Vakilzadeh’s family buried the body in a
    cemetery, but when they returned to the cemetery, they saw that the body
    had been unearthed. They were told that Ayatollah Khalkhali ordered that
    no “infidels” could be buried in the cemetery assigned to Muslims. Mr.
    Vakilzadeh’s body was exhumed in another cemetery as well, until after a
    few days, he was buried, during the night, in the Bahai cemetery with no
    stone so that he could not be identified. They planted a pomegranate tree
    to mark the grave (Mr. Vakilzadeh loved pomegranate trees). Several years
    later, the cemetery was destroyed and transformed into a military base.
