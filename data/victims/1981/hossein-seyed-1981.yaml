    News of the execution of Mr. Seyed-Hossein, along with four others, was
    published in the Kayhan newspaper on January 8, 1981. Arrest and detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. This trial
    took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Seyed-Hossein were announced as, adultery, drinking
    alcoholic beverages, using narcotics, and corrupting others. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Seyed-Hossein's defense.
