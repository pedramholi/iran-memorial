    The information about Mr. Mohammad Shafi’ Vali is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism by Rah-e Kargar Publications. He was an
    Air Force technician. Before the revolution, he was affiliated with the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization; but he disengaged from the Organization in
    1976. He was one of the main organizers of the revolt against the Royal
    Guards on February 10, 1979 (the night that the monarchy fell). After the
    revolution, he joined the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran,
    Rah-e Kargar. He and another Air Force technician, Hassan Tabataba’i, (who
    was executed along with him) published the United Responsible Army
    Personnel Publication. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They
    identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Mohammad Shafi’ Vali was arrested on the street, along with another Air
