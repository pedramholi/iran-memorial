    Mr. Abdolvahhab Falsafian is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Additional information was taken from an interview
    about Mr. Hamid Shabani who was executed along with Mr. Falsafian. Mr.
    Falsafian was active in a four-member cell of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, Majority branch. They mostly read books and newspapers. One
    of the activists of this group worked at the prosecution office and he
    brought some rather unimportant documents and gave them to the
    organization. When this activity was discovered, three members of the
    group, including Mr. Falsafian were arrested. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. After the 1979
    Revolution, the organization, which renounced armed struggle, split over
    their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Majority supported and considered the Islamic Republic as a
    revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime. After the spring of 1983,
    however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely because of their
    political beliefs. Arrest and detention Mr. Falsafian was arrested in
    Shiraz in September 1981 along with two other men. They were taken to the
    Shiraz detention center, where political prisoners were interrogated.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charge brought against the defendant is not known. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Falsafian’s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr.
    Falsafian and the two other men (Hamid Shabani and Mohammad Reza Golshan)
    arrested with him to execution. According to the Mojahed magazine, Mr.
    Falsafian was shot by firing squad on October 3, 1981. The three men were
    buried in a section of the Shiraz cemetery assigned to non-Muslims. This
    section, which includes the Bahai cemetery was reportedly later destroyed
    by state agents.
