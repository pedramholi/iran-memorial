    The information about Mr. Hamid Shabani, son of Hossein, has been
    collected from interviews with two of his school friends, one of whom was
    also a political activist working along with him. Mr. Shabani is also one
    of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Shabani was born in
    1957 in Firuzabad, a city in Fars province. He went to school in Shiraz.
    In 1976 he went to Tehran to enroll in Tehran University and study social
    sciences. He started his political activism as a student against the
    monarchy. In November 1978, Tehran University was closed due to mass
    protests. Therefore, Mr. Shabani returned to Shiraz with a friend (who is
    one of the sources of the information). In Shiraz, they formed a cell of
    the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. After the 1979 Revolution, he kept in
    touch with the Organization, and joined the Majority branch when the
    organization split in 1980. With the cultural revolution of spring 1980
    and the closure of all universities, Mr. Shabani could no longer go back
    to Tehran to continue his education. He then started his activities as
    duty officer in the military section of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization
    Majority Branch in Shiraz. This was what they called their group, despite
    the fact that Mr. Shabani was neither armed nor a duty officer. In this
    cell, they mostly read books and newspapers. One of the activists of this
    group worked at the prosecution office and he brought some rather
    unimportant documents and gave them to the organization. When this
    activity was discovered, three members of the group, including Mr. Shabani
    were arrested. A friend of his remembers Mr. Shabani as a tall young man
    with body of an athlete. One of characteristics was his kindness. He loved
    hiking and attended school hiking trips. In mid-August 1981, he got
    married. Unfortunately, he was arrested 3 weeks later. The Cultural
    Revolution began after Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech in March 1980 and
    ordered that universities be purged of all those who opposed his regime
    and be transformed into learning environments [as opposed to political
    forums] where an all-Islamic curriculum would be taught. The first wave of
    violence began on April 15, 1980 during a speech by Akbar Hashemi
    Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister
    of Interior] at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech, students
    supporting the regime took control of the University s central building
    and demanded that the university be purged from pro-Shah elements and
    other sellouts. On April 18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution issued
    a communiqu accusing political groups of converting higher education
    institutions into headquarters of discordant political activities and
    naming them as obstacles to the radical transformation of the
    universities. The communiqu gave these groups three days (Saturday April
    19 to Monday April 21) to shut down their activities in the universities.
    The Council stressed that the decision included libraries along with
    activities related to arts and sports. Political groups, which recruited
    members and had strong support in the universities, refused to evacuate.
    Before the Council s deadline, serious clashes took place between leftist
    groups and Islamist Associations, which were at times supported by
    security forces and paramilitary groups. These clashes, which peaked at
    the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in the death of several people
    and the wounding of hundreds of others on university campuses around the
    country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic authorities announced the
    victory of the Cultural Revolution and the closure of all universities in
    order to Islamicize the curricula. The universities remained closed for
    two years. One of the outcomes of the Cultural Revolution was the purging
    of many university professors and students based on their political
    beliefs. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group,
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin
    America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. After the 1979 Revolution, the organization, which
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority supported and
    considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist
    regime. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted
    its members solely because of their political beliefs. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Shabani was arrested in Shiraz in September 1981 along with
    two other men. They were taken to the Shiraz detention center, where
    political prisoners were interrogated. Mr. Shabani was denied visi
