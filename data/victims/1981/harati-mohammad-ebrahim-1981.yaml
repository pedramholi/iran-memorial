    The information about Mr. Mohammad Ebrahim Harati, son of Mohammad, was
    gathered from an interview with a relative. The public relations
    department of the Central Revolutionary Prosecution Office issued a
    statement regarding the execution of Mr. Harati along with four other
    individuals. The Kayhan newspaper published the statement on October 1,
    1981. Mr. Harati was born in Quchan (in the eastern province of Khorasan)
    in 1954. He studied mechanics at Aryamehr High School in Mashhad. While
    serving in the national draft, he was a sergeant and worked in the
    communications unit of the Hamedan Division. He participated in
    demonstrations against the monarchy. After the 1979 revolution, he became
    a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). He designed and
    distributed posters and signs. His designs were also published in MKO
    publications. In 1980, Mr. Harati was admitted to the Tehran University,
    and specialized in textile design at the School of Fine Arts. In April
    1980, when universities closed during the Cultural Revolution,* he
    returned to Quchan and worked at the Ministry of Health office in Quchan.
    The MKO had an office in Quchan. Many individuals who were political
    active and who had worked in the MKO office in Quchan have been executed.
    Mr. Harat’s family knew that he was a well-known political activist in the
    city and advised him to go underground, but Mr. Harati refused. The
    interviewee remembers Mr. Harati as “very warm and kind.” He helped others
    in every way that he could. He was a social, positive, and well-loved
    person. He could also draw very well. The statement of the Central
    Revolutionary Prosecution Office states, “Five of the active members of
    the militia section of the Hypocrites Organization… have been condemned to
    execution. [They] oppose Islam and think that through assassinations, they
    can avenge the divine religion and prophets. Yet, it is obvious that these
    dregs of Great Satan, similar to other criminals and followers of the
    devil, will be held in the garbage bin of history, and as God has
    promised, they will be in the abyss of hell for eternity.” (‘Hypocrites’
    is a term Iranian officials use to refer to the affiliates of the MKO.)
    Arrest and detention Mr. Harati was arrested in early September 1981 when
    he tried to help a relative avoid arrest. The revolutionary guards of
    Quchan drove their vehicle into Mr. Harati, who was riding a bicycle, and
    arrested him. State officials did not inform his family of the arrest and
    initially did not inform them where he was detained. About one week after
    the arrest, his family found out that he was detained in the Quchan
    prison, where political and other prisoners were held together. Soon, he
    was taken to another detention center, which was the former house of an
    official from the previous regime. The house was confiscated after the
    1979 revolution and used as a detention center. During his detention, Mr.
    Harati was denied visitations. According to his cellmates, who were later
    released, he was severely beaten in custody. Every week, his family
    brought clean clothes for him, left them with prison guards, and took his
    dirty clothes to wash. Mr. Harati hid small notes in his clothes, which
    was the only means of communication between him and his family. In the
    note, he let his family members know that he was fine and asked them to
    bring him belongings that he needed in prison. Some time after his arrest,
    a cleric contacted his family and advised them to convince Mr. Harati to
    repent and that repentance was in his own best interest. Hoping to have a
    visit with him, his family stated that if they were allowed to visit him,
    they might be able to do so. Shortly after, Mr. Harati made a short phone
    call home. Trial According to the statement of the Central Revolutionary
    Prosecution Office, Mr. Harati was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Quchan. His family is unaware of any such trial. Charges The
    Central Revolutionary Prosecution Office announced that Mr. Harati and
    four others were collectively charged with “membership in the militia of
    the Hypocrites; involvement in arson of an Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation
    branch as well as stores belonging to innocent people; assassination of a
    Hezbollahi merchant; participation in a demonstration and throwing Molotov
    cocktails; organization of illegal protests; and causing unrest with the
    public.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against the accused. Defense No information is
    available concerning Mr. Harati’s defense. The interviewee emphasizes that
    “except for participation in the national demonstration of June 20 [1981],
    the other charges are completely false.” This person notes that when his
    family advised him to hide, Mr. Harati refused and said that he was a
    state employee and had done nothing illegal.
