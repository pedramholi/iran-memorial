    Information about the execution of Mr. Farhang Mavedat, son of Fazlollah
    and Batul Rasekh, married and father of three, was obtained from multiple
    sources including Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran
    (ABC) interview with his wife Mrs. Mehraeen Mavedat on December 12, 2023
    and her book "Flame of Tests: The Story of Farhang Mavedat" (Toronto,
    2017). Additional details are sourced from the Archives of Baha i
    Persecution in Iran (ABPI), which includes documents such as Mr. Mavedat s
    will from Evin Prison on June 22, 1980, and reports published in Ettelaat,
    including the Tehran Prosecutor s office communique on June 22, 1981, and
    the Court Hearing for the Chairperson of the Baha i Assembly of Karaj on
    April 25, 1981.* Mr. Farhang Mavedat is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is
    listed in a 1999 report published by the Baha i International Community.
    The report, Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious
    Community , documents the persecutions of the members of the Faith in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978.
    Additional information has been drawn from various issues of The Baha i
    World. See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Mr. Mavedat was
    born into a Baha i family on 17 June 1925 in Tehran. (ABPI, Bio) At the
    age of ten, his mother passed away from illness. He and his six-year-old
    sister were cared for by their maternal grandparents, who also had seven
    other children. He later earned a degree in chemical engineering from
    Tehran University's Technical School and started his career at the Abkuh
    Sugar Governmental Factory in Mashhad, where he specialized in sugar
    production. Over the years, he worked at various refineries across Iran,
    including Miandoab, Mashhad, Rezaiyeh, West Shahabad, Torbat-e Heydarieh,
    Kahrizak Tehran, and Bardsir Kerman. Diagnosed with diabetes in 1960, Mr.
    Mavedat moved to Karaj for medical treatment and continued his career at
    the Karaj Sugar Factory until retirement (Flame of Tests, 2017). During
    that time, he co-founded a modern citrus cultivation facility near Kazeron
    in Fars province with agricultural experts. The farm was later attacked by
    unknown assailants and subsequently its property was confiscated. After
    his colleagues left Iran, he personally funded the wages of workers and
    compensated for the damages caused by the incident, which led to his
    interrogation ( Mrs. Mavedat, ABC interview, December 12, 2023). He served
    for fifteen years on the Dispute Resolution Council, was a member of the
    Mashhad Youth Committee, and held positions in several Local Spiritual
    Assemblies. At the time of his arrest, he chaired the Karaj Local
    Spiritual Assembly (Flame of Tests, 2017). Mr. Mavedat was initially
    arrested at home by four plainclothes guards armed with G3 rifles on
    September 18. Released within an hour due to the absence of Karaj
    prosecutor Ebrahim Raisi. He was summoned the next day to the
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor's office at Azimiyeh Prison on the Karaj
    to Chalus Road where he was arrested and held in solitary confinement for
    19 days. A day after, his wife was also arrested, and their possessions,
    including gold coins, jewelry, passports, cheque books, books, and photo
    albums, were seized. Although their car was eventually returned, it
    remained unusable due to the confiscation process. During their
    imprisonment, collectible gold coins and family photo albums from Bah
    conferences were also confiscated. Later, Mr. Mavedat discovered his wife
    in a nearby cell after she was transferred to solitary confinement. She
    was allowed brief daily moments under guard supervision to administer his
    insulin injection. (Flame of Tests, 2017). Mr. Mavedat and his wife were
    prosecuted in Azimiyeh prison by Ebrahim Raisi, later Iran's eighth
    president, known as "Brother Raisi." They were forced to appear barefoot
    before Judge Gholamreza Sultani, who sat on a podium while they sat on the
    ground. Following his wife s release, Mr. Mavedat was also released on
    bail. (Mrs. Mavedat, ABC interview, December 12, 2023). During an
    incident, Sheikh Rahnama ordered Mr. Mavedat to dig in his home backyard,
    alleging he hid weapons. Despite finding nothing, Rahnama confiscated
    books and an envelope containing their entire savings of 60,000 tuman.
    During the search, Rahnama remarked to his guards, who were also digging,
    "Are you tired? Because I am enjoying it." (Mrs. Mavedat, ABC interview,
    December 12, 2023). Sheikh Mostafa Rahnama, although not holding any
    official positions in the judiciary, the Revolutionary Committee, the
    Revolutionary Guards, or similar organizations, was known for persecuting
    Baha'is. (Sabeti, August 21, 2022) In December 1980, following an
    assassination attempt on November 11, 1980, Sheikh Rahnama accused
    Baha'is, including leaders from the Karaj Spiritual Assembly, of plotting
    his murder and conspiring against Islam and the revolution. On November
    25, he filed a complaint with Tehran's Evin public prosecutor, Assadol
