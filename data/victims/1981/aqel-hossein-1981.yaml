    The execution of Mr. Hossein Aqel, along with three other individuals, was
    announced by the Revolutionary Guards of Gilan province and published in
    the Kayhan newspaper on August 3, 1981. According to this report, Mr.
    Hossein Aqel was a member of the Peykar Organization. Mr. Hossein Aqel is
    one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on
    September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges According to the above announcement, the
    collective charge against Mr. Hossein Aqel and three other co-defendants
    was armed rebellion against the Islamic Republic regime. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Aqel s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Rasht identified Mr. Hossein Aqel a rebel, corruptor, and an enemy of
    God and condemned him to death. He was shot by a firing squad in Rasht on
    July 30, 1981 at dawn.
