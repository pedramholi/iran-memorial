    The execution of Mohsen Taheri (known as Lotfollah) and 14 other
    individuals was published in the Kayhan newspaper on July 22, 1981. Public
    Relations department of the Public Prosecution Office released the names
    and charges of the convicted individuals to the media. Mr. Taheri is one
    of the 430 individuals whose name appears in the list of Martyrs of the
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on
    the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those
    members of the Organization who died after the Revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals in this list have been executed. This
    execution was also announced in the addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No.
    261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization on the 6th of
    September 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social
    imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    Public Prosecution Office did not release the charges brought against Mr.
    Taheri to the media. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on his defense. Judgment In
    accordance with the verdict of the Revolutionary Tribunal, Mohsen Taheri
    was executed by a firing squad at Evin Prison in Tehran on July 21, 1981.
    No information is available on the judgment but the bodies of the executed
    individuals were transferred to the forensic medical team.
