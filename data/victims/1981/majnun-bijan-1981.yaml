    Mr. Bijan Majnun is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Additional information has been sent to Omid via an electronic
    form by an individual familiar with this case. According to this source,
    he became a sympathizer of Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Minority branch)
    in 1979 and was an active member of the Students Pioneer Organization. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and
    was active mainly in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest
