    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Motallebi, son of Hossein, and 3 other
    individuals, was published in Kayhan Daily newspaper on Saturday,
    September 26, 1981, quoting the communiqu of the Office of Public
    Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office. The
    names and crimes of the accused have been stated in this communiqu . Mr.
    Motallebi is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Based on available information, Mr. Motalebi was a 17-year-old
    high school student, born in Esfahan, residing in Rasht, and a supporter
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principals of
    Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of
    Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the
    Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic
    and social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Motallebi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. According to the
    communiqu of the Office of Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecutor General s Office, the Rasht Revolutionary Tribunal tried Mr.
    Motallebi and 3 other individuals. Charges The Office of Public Relations
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office has stated the
    charges brought against Mr. Ali Motallebi and 3 others as being armed
    rebellion against the Islamic Republic, participation in street clashes
    and skirmishes, membership in and active and effective support of the
    Hypocrites grouplet (derogatory terms used by the Islamic Republic to
    describe the MKO), concealing the [MKO] organization s information,
    approving the position adopted by the Hypocrites regarding armed struggle,
    bombings, and terrorism. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Motallebi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Motallebi s defense.
    Judgment The Rasht Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal declared Mr. Ali
    Motallebi and 3 other individuals Mofsed fel Arz ( one who spreads
    corruption on Earth ) and Mohareb with God and His Messenger ( One who
    wages war with God and the Prophet Mohammad, ) and sentenced them to
    death. The sentence was carried out on Wednesday, September 23, 1981 in
    [the city of] Rasht and he was shot by a firing squad. Mr. Motallebi was
    17 years old. . *The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and
    the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to
    the Islamic Republic authorities different interpretation of Islam,
    widened the gap between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to
    the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime
    attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and
    while distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO
    supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration
    protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the government
    officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr.
    Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration illegal,
    thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary
    Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from
    this demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were
    arrested
