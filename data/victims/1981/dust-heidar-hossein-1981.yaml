    The news about the execution of Mr. Heidar Hossein Dust was announced by
    the Public Relations Office of the Central Branch of the Islamic Republic
    s Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office and was published in the Kayhan and
    Jomhouri Eslami newspapers on July 7, 1981. The Prosecutor's communique
    reads as follows: The the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office thanks
    every responsible revolutionary person who fulfilled their religious duty,
    as stated by his Excellency Emam, and provided reports to the intelligence
    agents of the Prosecutor s Office. We hereby announce that the safe houses
    will be discovered one after another and these plotting centers will be
    exposed, for the will of the warrior and prudent people, and will be
    destroyed, with the almighty God s assistance. And the Great Devil [the
    United States] will be disappointed, more than ever before, with the land
    of Islam and Quran. Supplemental information about Mr. Hossein Dust was
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation via an electronic form by a person
    informed about this case. According to this information, Mr. Hossein Dust,
    son of Hossein, was born into a middle-class family on August 12, 1957. He
    had a technical machinery diploma and was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. Mr. Hossein Dust is also one of the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention According
    to the Public Relations Office of the Central Branch of the Islamic
    Republic s Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office, Mr. Hossein Dust was
    arrested, along with 89 others, by the Revolutionary Guards in
    Hezardastgah Naziabad Golabdareh on June 17, 1981. The Revolutionary
    Guards had surrounded the building where Mr. Hossein Dust was arrested.
    The latter was detained and continuously interrogated at the Evin Prison
    for 18 days. Trial According to the above-mentioned press release, Mr.
    Hossein Dust was tried at one of the branches of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court. Charges According to the official communique, the charges against
    Mr. Hossein Dust and 14 others were collectively, being the main
    coordinators, trainers, and leaders of the safe house, supplying fire arms
    and cold weapons, sending other defendants to the streets and public
    places after being trained for using weapons, and personally fighting with
    weapons. The press release also provided that Mr. Hossein Dust was the
    owner of the safe house and one of the active members of the group. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt According to the Prosecutor's Office published
    statement, the evidence presented against Mr. Hossein Dust and the other
    defendants was described as follows: During the search of the mentioned
    safe house, many weapons were recovered such as G3 machine guns, Molotov
    cocktails, containers of incendiary materials, bullets for Colt, Uzi, and
    G3 weapons, bows and arrows, slings, knives, carpet cutters, homemade
    grenades, bags of salt and pepper, pieces of stone and brick, gallows
    ropes, and other tools such as spray pai
