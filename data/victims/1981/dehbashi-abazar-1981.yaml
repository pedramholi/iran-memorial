    The execution of Mr. Abazar Dehbashi, son of Hassan, and three other
    individuals, including his son, was announced in the Enqelab Eslami
    newspaper on January 8, 1981. According to the newspaper, he was a
    resident of Bonab (East Azarbaijan province). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Dehbashi arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    There is no information regarding the trial, other than Mr. Dehbashi was
    tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz. Charges The
    collective charges against Mr. Dehbashi and three other individuals were
    announced as the following: “smuggling and trade of narcotic drugs,
    debauchery, armed robberies, causing fear and fright among the population,
    and cooperation with illegal armed groups of Komaleh and Sanar Mamedi.”
    The personal charge against Mr. Dehbashi is not known. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Dehbashi’s defense. Judgment In
    accordance with the verdict of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Tabriz, Mr. Abazar Dehbashi was executed in Tabriz.
