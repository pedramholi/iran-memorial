    The execution of Mr. Morteza Nazari was announced in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on August 9, 1981. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial other than he was tried by at the
    Tribunal for Combating Evil-doing. Charges Mr. Nazari was charged with
    “the act of sodomy.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on his defense.
    Judgment The Tribunal for Combating Evil-doing condemned Mr. Morteza
    Nazari to death. After the Supreme Court of the Islamic Revolution of Iran
    confirmed the ruling, he was executed by a firing squad on August 8, 1981.
