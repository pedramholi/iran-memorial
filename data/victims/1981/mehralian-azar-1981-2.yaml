    Information regarding the life and extrajudicial execution of Ms. Azar
    Mehralian, daughter of Kaklik and Ali, was submitted by one of her friends
    and classmates to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center through an electronic
    form. (June 22, 2017). News of this murder was also published in Kayhan
    newspaper (April 21, and 22, 1981). Additional information regarding this
    case was obtained from the Peykar Publication, Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class print publication (April 27, May 4, and
    June 1, 1981); Jomhuri Eslami newspaper (April 21, and 22, 1981); Enqelab
    Eslami newspaper (April 22, 1981); Nameh Mardom, Tudeh Party of Iran s
    central print publication (May 2, 1981); the Book Goriz-e Nagozir
    (2008-09); Radio Farda website (April 20, 2021); a speech given by a
    person close to her on the program Sachmehaye Tab id ( Exile s Shrapnel )
    (April 24, 2021); and Gooya website (June 3, 2021). According to available
    information, Ms. Mehralian was born in Tehran, single, and a third year
    student at Tehran s Assemi High School, studying economics. She was the
    fifth child of her family. Ms. Mehralian was a supporter of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class and starting in 1980,
    was active at the Organization s the D. D. Section (D and D standing for
    Danshju and Daneshamuz , meaning college student and high school student,
    respectively). Ms. Mehralian s activities in the Organization consisted of
    distributing pamphlets, selling Peykar Publication, writing slogans, and
    participating in demonstrations. According to one of her friends, Our job
    consisted mainly of distributing pamphlets, setting up shop on the side of
    the street, and selling books and publications. We would write slogans
    very early in the mornings. We would write slogans on walls or on seats in
    buses. We would throw pamphlets inside houses. We would have programs at
    school for different occasions. We also had wall newspapers. In spite of
    being very courageous and fearless, Azar was rather an introvert and
    extremely sensitive; she wrote poetry too . (Andisheh and Peykar website).
    According to a person close to Ms. Mehralian, she was very pretty and had
    a nice figure; she was tall and strong. She was a very good student. She
    read a lot. Her father was the one who had instilled the habit of reading
    in their household. She was only 17 years old at the time of the events.
    She was a young girl, like most young supporters of leftist organizations
    of the time, with all their goodness and their weaknesses, their honesty
    and their beliefs, their sense of devotion and their courage, their
    leftist tendencies and their impatience. Azar was very bold; she was
    always ready for the most difficult activities. One time when she was
    selling newspapers in the street, the Hezbollahis attacked to tear them
    up. She told them: Go ahead, tear them up! But at least read them before
    you do! And tell me what it is in these writings that you re opposed to!
    (The book Goriz-e Nagozir ). The Peykar Organization The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China
    had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed
    all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Cultural Revolution
    The Cultural Revolution began upon Ayatollah Khomeini s order in March
    1980, to purge universities of all forces opposed [to the regime] and to
    transform them into learning environments [as opposed to political forums]
    where an all-Islamic curriculum would be taught. The first wave of
    violence began on April 15, 1980, during a speech by Akbar Hashemi
    Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister
    of the Interior] at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech,
    students supporting the regime took control of the University s central
    building and demanded that the university be purged from pro-Shah elements
    and other sellouts. On April 18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution
    issued a communiqu accusing political groups of converting higher
    education institutions into headquarters of discordant political
    activities and naming them as obstacles to the radical transformation of
    the universities. The communiqu gave these groups three days (Saturday,
    April 19 to Monday, April 21) to shut down their offices and activities in
    the universities. The Cou
