    refused to deny his religion to protect his life. The news of the
    extrajudicial execution of Mr. Bahman Atefi (also spelled "Atifi") Afusi,
    son of Jamileh and Mohammad Baqer, along with his brother, Ezat ollah, and
    three other people, was obtained through Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s
    interviews with his brother's grandchild on March 18, 2012 and June 15 and
    September 24, 2018 (ABC interview). Additional information in this regard
    was obtained through Abdorrahamn Boroumand Center s interview with an
    informed person who previously lived in the village of Afus on May 14,
    2018 documents available at Abdorrahman Boroumand Center including a
    newsletter from the Baha i community and an October 6, 1994 court order
    from an Islamic Revolutionary Court specially assigned to handle such
    cases per an order issued on September 7, 1989, and Archives of Baha i s
    Persecution in Iran s website. Mr. Atefi is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is
    listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i International Community.
    The report documents the persecution of the members of the Faith in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1979. Mr.
    Atefi was born in the village of Afus near Faridan, Esfahan, in August 31,
    1947. He was a farmer. Because of his job and his honesty he had a good
    reputation and was well-known among the people in his village and the
    surrounding villages. He had primary school diploma. Mr. Atefi was married
    with four children. At the time of the arrest, his oldest child was 14
    years old and his youngest child was only 14 months old. Mr. Atefi was a
    Baha i and had no political affiliation or connection with any political
    group. There was a long history of harassment of Baha is in areas where he
    worked and lived. One of Mr. Atefi s relatives had been murdered by some
    villagers at the provocation of Mullahs before the 1979 revolution.
    However, during more recent years (the interview were conducted in 2012),
    many people in the village have come to regret their behavior during the
    period when Baha is were arrested and executed. They now sympathize with
    the victims families. They regret cooperating with authorities and not
    opposing the executions. Because of his job and his honesty, Mr. Atefi had
    a good reputation and was well-known among the people in his village and
    the surrounding villages. Baha is situation in the village of Afus An
    informed person who previously lived in the village of Afus stated in an
    interview with Abdorrahaman Boroumand Center that about 100 Baha is had
    lived in the village of Afus before the Islamic revolution. According to
    the interviewee, about 13 Baha i families had lived in Afus, all of whom
    were driven out of the village shortly after the Islamic Revolution.
    Following the Islamic Revolution, the arrest order for the members of the
    Baha is Local Spiritual Assembly* in the village of Afus was issued and
    nine members of the Assembly left the village with their families for fear
    of harassment, persecution, arrest, and execution. After leaving the
    village, their properties, houses, and farms were confiscated, and they
    had no reason to return to their hometown. Background The authorities of
    the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious
    community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300
    thousand members in 1979 ** - to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence. *** About 13 Baha i families had lived in Afus, all
    of whom were driven out of the village shortly after the Islamic
    Revolution. Arrest and detention On July 16, 1981, Mr. Atefi was arrested
    by agents of the Revolutionary Guards Headquarters without any arrest
    warrant. According to the interviewee, the agents did not specify the
    reasons for detention. It was evident, however, that Mr. Atefi was
    arrested for being Baha i. Shortly after this arrest, the agents had
    arrested Mr. Atefi s brother as well. For more than 50 days, Mr. Atefi and
    his brother were held in Daran Prison, located 150 kilometers south of
    Esfahan. During this time, they did not have access to an attorney. In
    late August 1981, about two week prior to his extrajudicial death, Mr.
    Atefi visited his family for the last time (ABC interview). Trial
    According to available information, no court session was held to try Mr.
    Atefi. Mr. Atefi s family members are not aware of any court session, and
    Mr. Atefi never mentioned anything about a trial during his visitation
    with family. Charges According to the interviewee, Mr. Atefi s sole charge
    was believing in the
