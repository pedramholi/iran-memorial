    News of the execution of Mr. Kurosh Kabiri-Yunesabadi, son of Jalal, along
    with eighteen others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on September
    19, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor
    s Office announced these executions, the defendants' names and their
    charges, and released it to the Pars news agency. Mr. Kurosh
    Kabiri-Yunesabadi is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the
    list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. According to this site, Mr. Kabiri was also a nephew of Mr.
    Alireza Zomorodian, another victim in this list. Mr. Kurosh
    Kabiri-Yunesabadi is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to the announcement by the Public Relations Department of the
    Central Public Prosecutor s Office, the charges against Mr. Kurosh
    Kabiri-Yunesabadi were announced as, "member in the American Organization
    of Peykar, being in charge of distribution of publications, propaganda at
    schools, being the organization s contact person with sympathizers, and
    participation in plotting against the Islamic Republic of Iran." These
    charges were the same for four sympathizers of Peykar. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Kurosh Kabiri-Yunesabadi's defense. Judgment The Central
    Islamic Revolutionary Court identified Mr. Kurosh Kabiri-Yunesabadi as,
    "Mohareb (fighter) against God and the Prophet and Mofsed(corruptor on
    Earth)." He was condemned to death and the ruling carried out in the Evin
    prison yard on September 19, 1981.
