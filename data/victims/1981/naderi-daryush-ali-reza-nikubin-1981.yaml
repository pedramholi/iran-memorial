    The Public Relations Office of Evin Prison announced the execution of Mr.
    Daryush Nikubin (with the pseudonym of Ali Reza Naderi), son of Akbar, and
    11 other individuals to the Pars news agency. The news was published in
    the Kayhan and the Johuri Eslami newspapers on the 5th of August 1981. Mr.
    Nikubin is one of the 430 individuals whose name appears on the list of
    “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class” published on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list contains
    the names of those members of the Organization who died after the
    Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. This execution was also announced in the addendum of the
    Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization
    on the 6th of September 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr.
    Nikubin was charged with “armed rebellion” or “armed action against the
    Islamic Republic” according to Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami respectively. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on his defense. Judgment The Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Mr. Daryush Nikubin to death. According
    to the Mojahed magazine, he executed on the 4th of August 1981. Kayhan and
    Jomhuri Eslami published the story of the execution by a firing squad at
    Evin Prison, the next day.
