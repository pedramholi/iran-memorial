    Information regarding the life and extrajudicial killing of Mr. Iraj
    Torabi, son of Golestan and Abbasali, was obtained from the writings of
    his two sisters (April 24, and June 23, 2021) as well as from the sisters
    lectures given on the Sachmehaye Tab eed Program (April 24, 2021). News of
    this murder was also published in Kayhan newspaper (April 21, and 22,
    1981). Additional information regarding this case was obtained from the
    Peykar Publication, Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class print publication (April 27, May 4, and June 1, 1981); Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper (April 21, and 22, 1981); Enghelab-e Eslami newspaper
    (April 22, 1981); Nameh Mardom, Tudeh Party of Iran s central print
    publication (May 2, 1981); the Book Goriz-e Nagozir (2008-09); Khavaran
    and Radio Farda websites (April 20, 2021); and Gooya website (June 3,
    2021). According to available information, Mr. Torabi was single, 21 years
    old, and born in the city of Shiraz. He had studied in a technical school
    in [the city of] Abadan and had a high school diploma. He started his
    political activities before the Revolution and actively participated in
    the demonstrations [that led to the Revolution], including the
    demonstrations related to the victims of the Cinema Rex fire. Mr. Torabi
    was a supporter of the Peykar Organization. He established contact with
    the Peykar Organization s Student Organization in November December 1979,
    and was in charge of distribution of the Organization s publications in
    Abadan for a time. He had to move to Shiraz during the Iran-Iraq war, and
    was active in revealing hidden facts about the war and helping those
    displaced by the war. Mr. Torabi went to Tehran after a while, where he
    remained for four months. He worked at a publishing house for a time, and
    put the company s facilities, including the copy machine, at the Peykar
    Organization s disposal. According to his sister Iraj was an honest and
    genuine person. He gave of himself and everything he had. He wanted to
    devote all of his time, energy, and everything he had to the Organization.
    The Peykar Organization The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social
    imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Cultural Revolution The
    Cultural Revolution began upon Ayatollah Khomeini s order in March 1980,
    to purge universities of all forces opposed [to the regime] and to
    transform them into learning environments [as opposed to political forums]
    where an all-Islamic curriculum would be taught. The first wave of
    violence began on April 15, 1980, during a speech by Akbar Hashemi
    Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister
    of the Interior] at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech,
    students supporting the regime took control of the University s central
    building and demanded that the university be purged from pro-Shah elements
    and other sellouts. On April 18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution
    issued a communiqu accusing political groups of converting higher
    education institutions into headquarters of discordant political
    activities and naming them as obstacles to the radical transformation of
    the universities. The communiqu gave these groups three days (Saturday,
    April 19 to Monday, April 21) to shut down their offices and activities in
    the universities. The Council stressed that the closure included libraries
    as well as offices related to arts and sports activities. Political
    opposition groups refused to shut down their offices and during those
    three days, clashes continued between leftist groups and Islamist
    Associations, which took control of the universities with the support of
    governmental forces and paramilitary groups. These clashes peaked at the
    end of the three-day deadline issued by the Council of the Revolution,
    resulting in the death of several people and the wounding of hundreds of
    others on university campuses across the country. On April 21, the Islamic
    Republic authorities announced the victory of the Cultural Revolution and
    the closure of all universities for two years. As a result of the Cultural
    Revolution, a large number of university professors were purged and a
    great many students were deprived of continuing their education because of
    their politic
