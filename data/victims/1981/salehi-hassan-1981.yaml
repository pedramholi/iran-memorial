    He believed one should not flee the city of Rasht. One should stay and
    continue the struggle. Information regarding the extrajudicial execution
    of Mr. Hassan Salehi was gathered from an interview with one of his old
    friends, conducted by Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC interview, July
    10, 2005). Mr. Salehi is also on the list of those who have lost their
    lives for the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Minority) and Kar Magazine,
    publication of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Minority) (August 1987).
    According to available information, Mr. Salehi was born in Rasht. He was
    single, had a high school diploma, and was a follower of The Fadaiyan
    Khalq Minority. He had broken his leg in an accident in 1979, and he
    walked with a limp since. Mr. Salehi had been politically active since
    before the revolution of 1979: He was the leader of a group who took over
    the Rasht Police Station. After the revolution, this neighborhood was a
    known hub of activities against the Islamic Republic. He was a known
    political activist in Rasht, particularly in the Noqreh Dasht
    neighborhood. On August 31, 1981, agents converged on Mr. Salehi s
    residence in order to arrest him. He was able to escape by jumping over
    his neighbor s wall. According to the interviewee, he did not leave Rasht
    after this incident: He resisted our insistence that he leave the town of
    Rasht, and he would say one should remain steadfast and continue the
    struggle. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly in the
    political arena and the labor movement. Background of Extrajudicial
    Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has
    a long history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the
    world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and
    outside the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing
    a large number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable.
    The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is
    not clear; however, these murders began in February 1979 and have
    continued since then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran
    attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been
    assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
    in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France,
    Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in
    Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases,
    there has not been much published, and local authorities have not issued
    arrest warrants. But documentation, evidence, and traces obtained through
    investigations conducted by local police and judicial authorities confirm
    the theory of state committed crimes. In some instances, these
    investigations have resulted in the expulsion or arrest of Iranian
    diplomats. In a few cases outside Iran, the perpetrators of these murders
    have been arrested and put on trial. The evidence presented revealed the
    defendants connection to Iran s government institutions, and an arrest
    warrant has been issued for Iran s Minister of Information. The manner in
    which these killings were organized and implemented in Iran and abroad is
    indicative of a single pattern which, according to Roland Chatelin, the
    Swiss prosecutor, contains common parameters and detailed planning. It can
    be ascertained from the similarities between these murders in different
    countries that the Iranian government is the principal entity that ordered
    the implementation of these crimes. Iranian authorities have not
    officially accepted responsibility for these murders and have even
    attributed their commission to internal strife in opposition groups.
    Nevertheless, since the very inception of the Islamic Republic regime, the
    Islamic Republic officials have justified these crimes from an ideological
    and legal standpoint. In the spring of 1979, Sadeq Khalkhali, the first
    Chief Shari a Judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts, officially
    announced the regime s decision to implement extrajudicial executions and
    justified the decision: These people have been sentenced to death; from
    the Iranian people s perspective, if someone wants to assassinate these
    individuals abroad, in any country, no government has any right to bring
    the perpetrator to trial as a terrorist, because such a person is the
    implementing agent of the sentence issued by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court. Therefor
