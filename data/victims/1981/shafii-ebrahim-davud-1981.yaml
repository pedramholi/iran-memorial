    Mr. Ebrahim Shafi i (Davud) is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an

    Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was
    established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They identified themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Arrest and detention Circumstances of this defendant s arrest
