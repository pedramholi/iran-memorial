    The news of the execution of Mr. Bashir Giahi and 37 other individuals was
    announced in a communiqué by the Central Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecutor’s Office published in Kayhan and Jomhouri Eslami newspapers on
    August 8, 1981. This communiqué referred to the executed individuals as
    “blood-thirsty hacks of the American grouplet, the Hypocrites.” Mr. Bashir
    Giahi, an industrial worker and a supporter of Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members’ interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah’s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization’s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Giahi’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No detailed information is available on
    Mr. Giahi’s trial. However, according to the communiqué from the Central
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office the sentences of Mr. Giahi and
    37 other individuals were handed down during a one-week period. Charges
    Mr. Giahi was charged with plotting to overthrow the Islamic Republic in
    safe houses. The Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office
    communiqué also referred to all executed individuals as “God-less
    apostates.” Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Giahi.
    Defense According to the communiqué from the Central Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecutor’s Office the court heard the "last defenses of the defendants."
    No detailed information is available, however, on Mr. Giahi’s defense.
    Judgment The Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Giahi to
    death. He was executed on August 7, 1981 by a firing squad in Tehran’s
    Evin Prison. He was 24 years old at the time of his execution. *The
    exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of their
    centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic
    authorities’ different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between
    the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as
    “Hypocrites” and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
    treatment by governmental officials and the government officials’ efforts
    to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact
    that the regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and
    Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from this
    demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were arrested
    and executed in the following days and weeks. The day after the
    demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a repressive campaign –
    unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and
    sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO
    announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and assassinated
    a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the Islamic regime.
    In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the impeached President
