    Mr. Hossein Maki is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Mr. Hossein Maki is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in
    an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. According to this report, he was 20
    years old and single and a university student. The Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention

    available about the defendant’s execution.
