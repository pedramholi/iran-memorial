    The information about Ms. Fatemeh Rokhbin, daughter of Hossein, was sent
    to Omid through an electronic form by a friend of hers. The Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecution Office announced her execution in a statement,
    published in the Kayhan newspaper on October, 14, 1981. She is also one of
    the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No.
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Ms. Rohkbin was born in
    Bandar Abbas into a Muslim middle-class family in 1966. She was a student
    at 17-Shahrivar High School in Bandar Abbas. She got engaged about one
    month prior to her arrest. The statement of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecution Office begins with this verse of the Quran, And fight them on
    until there is no more tumult or oppression (II: 193). The ever-present
    Muslim nation is determined and resolute to fight the satanic armies of
    polytheists and hypocrites, and vows to not settle until all that the
    devil manifests through superpowers and powers that destroy the world is
    annihilated. With this aim, the Muslim nation will send the agents of the
    superpowers and the inhuman mercenary mini-groups into the trash can of
    history. To carry out this divine duty, the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Bandar Abbas has condemned 13 agents of world-destroying America and of
    the Hypocrites (which are both on their way to extinction) to execution. (
    Hypocrites is a term used by officials of the Islamic Republic to refer to
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.) Arrest and detention Ms. Rohkbin was
    arrested along with her fianc at a rally to protest the mass execution of
    70 individuals in Bandar Abbas. The executed were buried in mass graves
    and the land was ploughed several times. From the time of arrest to
    execution, she was in detention for only a few days (electronic form). No
    other details are known about her arrest and detention. Trial The
    newspaper report refers to the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Bandar
    Abbas. Charges Ms. Rokhbin and 12 others were collectively charged with:
    membership in terrorist teams; armed rebellion against the rule of God;
    planning and participation in anti-people demonstrations and
    confrontations, which led to the martyrdom of several individuals;
    participation in numerous robberies ( automobile theft and bank
    robberies); being active in safe houses, dens of corruption and
    prostitution rings in Tehran, Karaj, and Bandar Abbas; importing weapons
    to Bandar Abbas; possession of G3, Uzi, and Colt weapons as well as large
    quantities of bullets and grenades; collecting funds for the terrorist
    mini-groups of the Hypocrites; identifying members of the Revolutionary
    Guards Corps, Basij, police, and Hezbollah individuals in order to
    assassinate them; being responsible for all the assassinations in Bandar
    Abbas; attacking and disarming members of the police in Bandar Abbas;
    arson of houses and stores; forging state documents and birth certificates
    using fake names. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms. Rokhbin s defense.
    Based on the information available, Ms. Rokhbin was not affiliated with
    any political organization and she only participated in a protest against
    the mass executions. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Bandar
    Abbas recognized Ms. Rokhbin and 12 other individuals as corruptors on
    earth, at war with God and his Prophet; and as rebels. The court condemned
    them to death. They were shot by firing squad on October 13, 1981 in
    Bandar Abbas. She was 15 years old.
