    The information about Mr. Ali Sehati has been drawn from an interview with
    an individual familiar with this case. He was a senior at the Kharazmi
    High School in Tehran and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. The interviewee remembers him as a tall athletic man with
    sharp features. Arrest and detention Mr. Sehati was arrested in Tehran in
    November or December 1981. He was denied visitation rights. Trial The
    details of his trial are not known. During the trial, it was revealed that
    Mr. Sehati had lied during his interrogation. In October 1981, Mr. Sehati
    saw a friend’s name on the list of the executed individuals in a press
    release of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office. After
    arrest and interrogation, under duress, Mr. Sehati gave this person’s name
    to the authorities as someone who was in charge of Mr. Sehati’s political
    activities. Later it turned out that this friend’s name was published by
    mistake and that he was alive. At the trial, the religious judge brought
    this person in front of Mr. Sehati. As soon as Mr. Sehati found out that
    his friend was not dead, he retracted his confession, stressing that his
    statement about his friend was baseless. Mr. Sehati was beaten and taken
    out of the courtroom after this announcement. (This friend was executed in
    1990.) Charges The charges brought against the defendant are not known.
    Evidence of guilt At the trial, it was revealed that Mr. Sehati had lied
    in his interrogations. Defense No information is available concerning his
    defense. Judgment Mr. Ali Sehati was executed on December 27, 1981. He was
    18 years old. He was buried at the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery.
