    News of the execution of Mr. Sadeq Sadeqi, son of Hassan, along with
    twenty-two others, was published in the Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami
    newspapers on July 19, 1981, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office of the Islamic Republic. Mr.
    Sadeq Sadeqi is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. According to this source, Mr. Sadeq
    Sadeqi was a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization; however, according to
    the Public Relations Office of the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor’s
    Office of the Islamic Republic, he was an activist of the Kordestan
    Democratic Party and in charge of connections with the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. The Kordish Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI) was founded in
    1945 with the objective of gaining autonomy for Kurdistan, in north-west
    Iran. After the Revolution, conflicts between the new central Shiite
    government and mainly Sunni Kurdistan, regarding the role of minorities in
    the drafting of the constitution, specification of Shiite as the official
    state religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in
    armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the
    militia of the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, 1979,
    when people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime. On
    August 19, 1979 Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the “party of Satan”
    and declared it “unofficial and illegal.” Mass executions and fighting
    broke out and continued for several months in the region. By 1983, the
    PDKI had lost much of its influence in the region. Various leaders of the
    PDKI have been assassinated. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention There
    is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention.
    According to the statement by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, “he had
    attempted to commit suicide, after being identified.” Trial The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tehran tried Mr. Sadeq Sadeqi. No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Sadeq
    Sadeqi were announced as, “an active member of the criminal Kordestan
    Democratic Party and in charge of connections with the Monafeqin
    [Mojahedin Khalq] Organization in Kashan, apostate, espionage, acts
    against the Islamic Republic, and being a prison guard for democrats.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against this defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Sadeq Sadeqi's defense.
    Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kashan identified Mr. Sadeq
    Sadeqi as "Mofsed (corruptor on Earth), Mohareb (fighter) against God, and
    Baghi (rebel)." He was condemned to death. The ruling was carried out when
    he was executed by firing squad in the Evin prison yard on July 5, 1981 at
    night. No specific information is available about the defendant’s
    execution.
