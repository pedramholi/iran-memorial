    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Morad Rahimi, son of Ebrahim, along with
    fourteen others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August
    31, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Public
    Prosecutor’s Office announced these executions, the defendants' names and
    their charges, and released it to the press. Mr. Rahimi is one of the 430
    individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. Additionally, he is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    communiqué of the Public Relations Department of the Central Revolutionary
    Public Prosecutor’s Office states: “Hail to the fighters of the war
    against the world infidels under the leadership of blood-thirsty America,
    and hail to the heroic and martyr-producing nation, which obstruct
    criminals and merciless Hypocrites, and which reports these criminals
    against the Koran and Islam to the armed forces and the judiciary on a
    daily basis, and which accepts the calling of the Koran that ‘O Prophet,
    strive hard against the unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and be firm
    against them’” [9: 73]. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to the announcement, the charges against Mr. Rahimi were "a)
    Being in charge of the Publication and Distribution Committee for Internal
    Publications under cover of two lithographic companies called Azar and
    Technofine, b) Armed robbery from Melli Bank in Salsabil and stealing the
    workers' salaries in General Motors in Karaj, c) Frequenting the
    organization's houses in order to plan for assassinations and overthrow of
    the Islamic Republic." Also, five defendants were collectively charged
    with "working underground and serving full-time for the hellish
    organization and receiving salaries." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rahimi's
    defense. Judgment َThe Central Islamic Revolutionary Court identified Mr.
    Rahimi as "an enemy of God and the Prophet, a corruptor on earth, and a
    rebel." He was condemned to death and executed on August 29, 1981.
