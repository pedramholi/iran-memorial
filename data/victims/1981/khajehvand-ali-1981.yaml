    The execution of Mr. Ali Khajehvand, along with three other individuals,
    was announced in a communiqué of the Public Relations Department of the
    Central Revolutionary Public Prosecutor’s Office, and published in the
    Kayhan newspaper on August 18, 1981. Mr. Khajehvand is also one of the 430
    individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the Organization who died after the Revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Moreover, Mr.
    Khajehvand is among the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The official communiqué states: “… four members of
    the Peykar and Hypocrite [referring to Mojahedin Khalq Organization]
    group-lets, who had had aimed their guns at the heart of our dispossessed
    nation and had served the armed forces of American imperialism and the
    criminal Saddam [Hussein] on the soil of our Islamic fatherland, were
    brought to the divine justice.” The Peykar Organization for the Liberation
    of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Mr. Khajehvand was tried in the Revolutionary Court of Qazvin. No
    other information is available on the trial. Charges The charges against
    Mr. Khajehvand were announced as “establishing a safe house, gathering
    intelligence about the Revolutionary Guards, publishing and distributing
    the Peykar publications, and recruiting [for the Organization].” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Khajehvand’s defense. Judgment َThe
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qazvin condemned Mr. Ali Khajehvand to
    death and he was executed by firing squad on August 13, 1981.
