    He was single, possessed a high school diploma, and was enrolled at Tehran
    Teacher Training College to study physics education. Information regarding
    the arbitrary execution of Mr. Ali Zoqi, along with one other person, was
    published in The Ideal That Boils Memorial to the Martyrs of the
    Organization of Iranian People's Mojahedin (Marxist Leninist) and the
    Peykar Organization (September 2023); Peykar magazine, the official
    publication of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class (June 28, 1981); and on the Asr-e No website (June 23, 2011). Mr.
    Zoqi was born in Tehran on June 17, 1958, into a large family. He was
    single and had a high school diploma. He enrolled at the Tehran Teacher
    Training College to study physics education. His interest in politics
    started during the Pahlavi era, after his uncle's arrest. He participated
    in anti-monarchical protests in 1978 1979. Mr. Zoqi highly valued
    theoretical discussion and dedicated much of his free time to reading
    political and theoretical texts. After the 1979 Revolution, he became a
    member of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class,
    once its headquarters were established at the University of Tehran. He was
    involved in its networks among school and university students. In the
    summer of 1980, he was arrested for writing slogans on a wall and spent
    nearly three months in custody. During the "Cultural Revolution," he,
    along with other students, opposed the shutdown of universities in May
    1980 and stayed on campus for several days. He also took part in the
    demonstration organized by the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization on June 20,
    1981. The Peykar Organization The Peykar Organization for the Liberation
    of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social
    imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Demonstrations on June 20,
    1981 The demonstration of June 20, 1981, took place in protest against the
    parliament s impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic s
    systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) from
    the country s political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet
    with MKO leaders and his insistence for them to disarm. The MKO had until
    then supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function
    within the framework of the new political system. On June 20, the
    Organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations, in which some of the
    demonstrators were armed, all over the country. These demonstrations,
    which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of
    demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that targeted not only
    the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized as
    official government policy the months-old state harassment and suppression
    of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Mr. Ali Zoqi s arbitrary execution According to
    available information, Mr. Zoqi was killed on June 20, 1981, when
    Revolutionary Guard members opened fire near Ferdowsi Square in Tehran. He
    joined the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    after its headquarters were established at the University of Tehran, and
    he began working within its school and university student networks.
    According to witnesses, Mr. Zoqi was looking for paint and other supplies
    to write slogans during the protest that day. They also said that he was
    wearing sneakers during the clashes, and his arm was injured with bandages
    on it. Mr. Zoqi s body was buried in the village where his parents were
    born. The phrase Ali, martyr of the people s movement was frequently seen
    inscribed on the cemetery s walls and gates. (The Ideal That Boils)
    Officials Reaction The authorities handed over Mr. Zoqi s dead body to his
    family. Agents of the regime destroyed his gravestone several times. (The
    Ideal That Boils) Familys Reaction No information is available regarding
    the family s reaction. However, while mourning her son, his mother said:
    "Ali was my teacher." (The Ideal That Boils) Impacts on Family There is no
