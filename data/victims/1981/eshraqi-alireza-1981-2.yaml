    Alireza loved his hometown Golpaygan. He believed being a teacher was a
    way for him to connect with people and particularly with children, and
    that it was the best way to serve his country. Information regarding the
    life and the execution of Mr. Alireza Eshraqi, son of Alieh and Fathollah,
    was obtained from an interview conducted by Abdorrahman Boroumand Center
    with one of his relatives (April 9, 2025); receipt of an electronic
    document sent by one of his relatives to Boroumand Center (March 3, 2025);
    Kayhan Newspaper (September 19, 1981); Ettela at Newspaper; and a notice
    published by the public relations office of the Chief Public Prosecutor of
    the Islamic Revolution in the Jomhouri-e Eslami Newspaper (September 20,
    1981). Mr. Alireza Eshraqi is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. According to available information, Mr. Eshraqi was
    born in Golpaygan, in Esfahan Province, and he was 27 years old. He grew
    up in an intellectual family and went to the Business School in Tehran for
    higher education after he finished his secondary education. Upon getting
    his Bachelor s degree, he was hired by the Ministry of Education to teach
    high school. He taught for a while at Doctor Shari ati High School in
    Golpaygan, but then he was fired. In 1976 he got married, and he had a
    child. He loved his wife and his daughter. According to an informed
    source, One of his salient characteristics was that he was very kind,
    caring, courteous, and well spoken. He was very responsible about his
    family. Alireza really loved his home town Golpaygan and he believed that
    being a teacher was a way for him to connect with people and particularly
    with children, and that the best way to serve your country is to be a
    teacher. (Abdorrahman Boroumand Center Interview, April 9, 2025) After the
    Military Phase of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization was begun, Mr. Eshraqi
    was a member of this organization. He was in charge of the finances of the
    organization in the town of Arak (Abdorrahman Boroumand Center Interview,
    April 9, 2025). Mr. Eshraqi and his family had given refuge to some
    comrades in their own home and they lived communally. Mr. Eshraqi s case
    has to do with his membership in the Mojahedin Khalq Organization,
    maintaining a safe house, and providing necessary equipment for this
    organization in Arak. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention According
    to the person who was interviewed, immediately following the explosion in
    the prime minister s office in Tehran, on August 30, 1981, the Islamic
    revolutionary guards forces arrested Mr. Eshraqi and eight of his comrades
    at his home in Arak, without showing an arrest warrant. According to a
    knowledgeable source, the agents broke the door and entered the home: The
    people who arrested them were all revolutionary guards. There were 12-14
    of them. When they attacked the home they were in plain clothes and they
    were armed. They violently entered the apartment, attacked individuals,
    sat on them, and proceeded to put them in handcuffs. Islamic revolutionary
    guard forces detained Mr. Eshraqi s wife and child in their home for hours
