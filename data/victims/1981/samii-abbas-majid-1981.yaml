    News of the execution of Mr. Abbas Sami i, son of Asadollah, and 15 other
    individuals was published on December 26, 1981 in Kayhan Daily newspaper
    and Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, quoting the announcement of the Office of
    Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office.
    The names and crimes of the accused have been stated in this announcement.
    Other details about this execution have been sent to the Boroumand
    Foundation via electronic form by a person close to Mr. Sami i. Mr. Sami i
    is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According
    to available information, Mr. Abbas Sami i was 25 years old, a
    veterinarian, residing in Tehran, in charge of Jondishapur University
    Mosque and Library in Ahvaz, and a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. According to the announcement of the Office of
    Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office,
    the Ahvaz Revolutionary Court issued the decision in the case of Mr. Sami
    i and three other individuals. Charges According to the announcement of
    the Office of Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor
    General s Office, the charges against Mr. Sami i and one other individual

    in Khuzestan, armed insurrection against the Islamic Republic,
    participating in team houses and directing the same, and collecting
    financial assistance for the benefit of the Organization. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Sami i. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Sami i s defense. Judgment The Ahvaz Islamic Revolutionary Court
    declared Mr. Sami i Mofsed e fel arz ( One who spreads Corruption on
    Earth, ) Mohareb ( One who wages war with God, ) with God and His
    Messanger, and Baqi ( One who has turned against Islam ) and sentenced him
    to death. The sentence was carried out on Sunday, December 6, 1981 in

    _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called
