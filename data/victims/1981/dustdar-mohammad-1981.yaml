    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Dustdar, son of Jalil, along with 35
    others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on November 26, 1981. The
    Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor’s Office
    announced these executions, the defendants’ names and their charges, and
    released it to the Pars news agency. Mr. Dustdar is one of the 430
    “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. His name also
    appears in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Dustdar were announced as “having contact
    with Ezoddin Hosseini [a Kurdish opposition leader] and people who were
    involved in the coup d’état." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Dustdar’s defense.
    Judgment َThe Central Islamic Revolutionary Court called Mr. Dustdar an
    “an enemy of God, a corruptor on earth and a rebel against the Islamic
    regime.” He was condemned to death and executed by firing squad in Evin
    yard in Tehran on November 25, 1981.
