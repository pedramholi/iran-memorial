circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mir Ja'far Pur Fattah was reported by the newspaper
    Kayhan on July 16th , 1981. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. A 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts (5 kg of hashish or
    opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone) of
    proscribed narcotics has been used to sentence thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers to death, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr. Pur Fattah was accused
    of being in possession of "120 grams of heroin". Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Pur Fattah's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tabriz issued the death sentence against Mr. Pur Fattah, for
    being "a corruptor on earth and at war with God", and the Supreme Judicial
    Council approved the verdict. He was executed at midnight on Wednesday
    July 15th, 1981.
