    The execution of this person, another with another young man, was

    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial other than he
    was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz. Charges This
    individual was charged “several counts of committing the lewd act of
    sodomy.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact
    number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on his defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz condemned these two individuals, charged
    with “sodomy”, to death. They were executed by a firing squad on February
    25, 1981.
