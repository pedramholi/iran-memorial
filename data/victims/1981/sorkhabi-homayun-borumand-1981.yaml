    Homayun was a high schooler and a simple supporter of the Mojahedin who
    left home on a June 20 at 4 pm and never went back! News of the execution
    of Mr. Homayun Borumand Sorkhabi, son of Gholam Ali, was provided to
    Abdorrahman Boroumad Center via three electronic forms. (Sep 13, 2019,
    March 01, 2019 and Sep 22, 2015). The news of this execution and 34 other
    individuals, was also published in Kayhan newspaper on Monday, September
    28, 1981, quoting the communiqu of the Office of Public Relations of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office. The names and crimes of
    the accused have been stated in this communiqu . Mr. Borumand is also one
    of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Borumand, a high
    schooler who was also a supporter of Mojahedin Khalq Organization*, was
    born in Tabriz. (E-forms) International laws have strictly prohibited
    capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time
    of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offense committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr. Borumand Sorkhabi left his house
    in Tabriz on June 20, 1981 at 4:00 pm and never went back. Later, his
    family found out that he was arrested on the same day. He was only 16
    years old at the time of arrest. Mr. Borumand Sorkhabi Was in Prison for
    three months. His last visitation with his family was on a Wednesday,
    September 16, 1981. (E-forms) Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Tabriz tried Mr. Borumand Sorkhabi and the other 34 individuals. (Kayhan
    Newspaper) There is no specific date available for a trial that only took
    for a minute; however, Mr. Borumand was sentenced to 5 years of
    imprisonment during that short session. (E-forms) Charges The Office of
    Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office
    has stated the charges brought against Mr. Homayun Borumand and 6 others
    as being organizing and establishing contact with other Hypocrites
    (derogatory term used by the Islamic Republic to describe the MKO) while
    in prison and creating disorder [therein.] During the trial, Mr. Borumand
    Sorkhabi was charged with "Support the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and
    distribution of their magazine" The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution in Kayhan Newspaper does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Borumand; however, according to the e-froms,
    he was in possession of MKO's magazines at the time of arrest. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Borumand s defense. A Summary of the Legal
    Defects in the Adjudication of Mr. Homayun Borumand Sorkhabi s Case In the
    early years of the Revolution, the judicial system went into complete
    disarray and clerics who supported the newly installed regime came into
    the system in the form of Shari a judges. It was these clerics who issued
    the sentences in the majority of political and security-related cases. The
    impartiality and independence of these Shari a judges is highly in doubt.
    The majority of the defendants were not allowed to be represented by an
    attorney, and trials took place very quickly and without any
    investigations. What we see in the present case is that the defendant had
    not had any armed activity whatsoever, and actually, at the time of his
    arrest, the Mojahedeen Khalq Organization had not yet declared that it was
    [changing its policies of support for the newly installed Islamic Regime]
    and beginning an armed struggle against it. Mr. Boroumand was arrested at
    the age of 17 and it is absolutely impossible for him to have been one of
    the Organization s officials and in a decision-making position. At most,
    he could have been a simple supporter of the Organization. Therefore,
    considering that the sentences issued for members of Mojahedeen were
    mostly based on the charge of Moharebeh ( waging war on God ) and Efsad
    fel-Arz ( spreading corruption on Earth ), Mr. Boroumand could not be
    sentenced to death even if it could have been proven that he was a
    supporter of the Organization, because the act of Moharebeh cited by the
    courts at the time, was based on Shari a rules [the crime not having been
    defined in the Penal Code yet] and consisted of taking up arms with the
    intention of causing fear and apprehension [in the populace] and engaging
    in killings. In other words, Mohareb was a person who took up arms with
    the intention of fighting God and/or the Islamic government, whereas it is
    clear that
