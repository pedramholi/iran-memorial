circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Reza Daneshvari, son of Jamshid, and Akbar Parvari,
    along with 3 other individuals, was announced in the communiqué of the
    Revolutionary Public Prosecution Office of Tabriz, and published in the
    Kayhan newspaper on June 13, 1981. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial other than he was tried
    at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Daneshvari, according to the communiqué of the
    Revolutionary Public Prosecution Office, were “repeated acts of sodomy,
    and moral corruption.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution only refers to “their own explicit and repeated confessions”
    regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Daneshvari and his
    co-defendant. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on his defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz condemned Mr. Reza Daneshvari to death.
    He was executed by a firing squad along with 4 other individuals on June
    12, 1981 at Tarbiz prison.
