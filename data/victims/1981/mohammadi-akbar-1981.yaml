    Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Additional information about Mr.
    Akbar Mohammadi is taken from the book Our Martyrs for Freedom and
    Socialism by Rah-e Kargar publications. He was a sympathizer of the
    Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran, Rah-e Kargar. "Rah-e Kargar"
    or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the
    summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various
    leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in
    political action. They identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists,
    promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat.
    They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they
    opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest
