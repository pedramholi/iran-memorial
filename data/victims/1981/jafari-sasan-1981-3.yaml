    Mr. Sasan Ja’fari is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Further information regarding Mr. Ja’fari’s arrest, detention
    and death was sent to Omid via an electronic form (e-form) by a person
    familiar with this case. Mr. Ja’fari was one of the sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization and was politically active. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Ja’fari was reportedly arrested in 1981 on his way to a drug
    store "because he looked suspicious" of being a political activist, by the
    Revolutionary Guards. He refused to give out his real name due to the fear
    of being identified as one of the Mojahedin Khalq’s sympathizers. He was
    held at the Evin Prison and did not have visitations with his family to
    keep his identity hidden. He was reportedly tortured while in prison
    (e-form). Trial It is not clear whether the defendant had a trial or not.
    Charges The reports of this execution do not specify the charges brought
    against this defendant. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Ja’fari's defense. It is mentioned in the
    form that he was engaged in cultural and political activities in his
    neighborhood in the west of Tehran. Judgment It is mentioned on the e-form
    that Mr. Ja’fari’s family visited the prison multiple times giving the
    authorities his physical description before they were notified by the
    authorities that he had committed suicide while in prison. His former
    cellmates, however, denied this allegation saying that Mr. Ja’fari did not
    commit suicide but was killed under torture. Mr. Ja’fari’s family learnt
    of his death in 1985, but the exact year of his death is unknown.
