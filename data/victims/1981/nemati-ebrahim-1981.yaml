    The execution of Mr. Ebrahim Ne’mati, son of Habib, and 21 other
    individuals was announced by the Public Relations section of the Central
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office and published in the Jomhuri
    Eslami and the Kayhan newspapers on December 26, 1981. Mr. Ne’mati is also
    one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Ne’mati
    was a student affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial,
    other than he was tried at the Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal.
    Charges The personal charges brought against Mr. Ne’mati are not known. He
    and 18 other individuals were collectively charged with: “Plotting and
    rebellion against the regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran,
    participation in armed demonstration, including the demonstration of June
    20, providing place and financing for the Hypocrites [i.e. the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization], participation in assassinations of the Revolutionary
    Guards brothers, possession of arms and ammunitions, active membership in
    armed teams of the Hypocrites, and living in safe houses.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. The demonstration
    of June 20, 1981, took place in protest against the parliament’s
    impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic’s systematic
    policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) from the
    country’s political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with
    MKO leaders and his insistence for them to disarm. The MKO had until then
    supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function
    within the framework of the new political system. On June 20, the
    Organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations, in which some of the
    demonstrators were armed, all over the country. These demonstrations,
    which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of
    demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that targeted not only
    the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized as
    official government policy the months-old state harassment and suppression
    of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Ne’mati’s defense. Judgment The
    Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Mr. Ebrahim Ne’mati to
    death. According to the Mojahed magazine, he was shot by a firing squad in
    Tehran on December 25, 1981. He was 20 years old.
