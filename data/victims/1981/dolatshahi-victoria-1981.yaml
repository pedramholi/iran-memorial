    Information about Ms. Victoria Dolatshahi has been sent to Omid via two
    electronic forms. She is on the list of 430 “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Peykar Andeesheh, one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), and the Peykar magazine, No.
    118 (Sep. 14, 1981). Ms. Dolatshahi was born in Kermanshah in a prominent
    Kurdish family. According to the form, she was a “free spirit who loved
    history and literature.” She was a senior student at Parvin E’tesami high
    school and a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The exact circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. The sender of electronic form states that she was
    arrested by the Revolutionary Guards, in accordance with the order of a
    local Shiite Cleric in the evening of June 22, 1981; during her detention
    in Dizelabad prison, she was tortured. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on the
    charges brought against Ms. Dolatshahi. Evidence of guilt According to the
    Peykar magazine, the state officials found no evidence to prove Ms.
    Dolatshahi was a sympathizer of the Organization. Defense No information
    is available on the defense. Judgment The details of the verdict leading
    to this execution are not known. According to the Peykar list, Ms.
    Victoria Dolatshahi was executed by a firing squad in Kermanshah on August
    7, 1981.
