    The execution of Mr. Hossein Azarifar, son of Ali Asghar, and 18 others
    was announced in a communiqué of the public relations department of the
    central Islamic revolutionary prosecution office and published in the
    Kayhan newspaper on September 19, 1981. Mr. Azarifar is also one of the
    430 individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Moreover, he
    is among the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on
    September 6, 1985. According to the website of Andeesheh va Peykar, Mr.
    Azarifar was an experienced member of Peykar and worked in the publication
    center of the organization. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the trial other than Mr. Azarifar was
    tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran. Charges The
    communiqué of the public relations department of the central Islamic
    revolutionary prosecution office announced the charges brought against Mr.
    Azarifar as follows: “membership in the American organization, Peykar,
    presence in a safe-house, being responsible for organizational activities
    in provincial cities.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Azarifar’s defense.
    Judgment According to the “religious” sentence of the Islamic
    revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran, Mr. Azarifar was recognized as an “enemy
    of God and His Prophet, and a corruptor on earth” and was condemned to
    death. He and 18 others were shot by firing squad on September 19, 1981 at
    Evin prison in Tehran.
