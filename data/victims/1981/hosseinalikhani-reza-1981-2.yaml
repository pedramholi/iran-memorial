    The execution of Mr. Reza Hosseinalikhani and 14 other individuals was
    announced in the Kayhan newspaper No. 11340 dated the 22nd of July 1981.
    Public Relations department of the Public Prosecution Office released the
    names and charges of the convicted individuals to the media. Mr.
    Hosseinalikhani is one of the 430 individuals whose name appears on the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list
    contains the names of those members of the Organization who died after the
    Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Additional information has been taken from the Peykar
    magazine, No. 121. Moreover, this execution was announced in the addendum
    of the Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Hosseinalikhani was born in
    1944. He was a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization and played a role in
    the publication and distribution of Kargar beh Pish magazine. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The Public Prosecution Office did not release the charges brought
    against Mr. Hosseinalikhani to the media. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the
    defense. Judgment In accordance with the verdict of the Revolutionary
    Tribunal, Mr. Reza Hosseinalikhani was executed by a firing squad at Evin
    Prison in Tehran on July 21, 1981.
