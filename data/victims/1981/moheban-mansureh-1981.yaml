    News of the execution of Ms. Mansureh Moheban, daughter of Assadollah,
    along with 25 others, was published by Kayhan and Jomhuri-e Eslami
    newspapers on October 10, 1981, quoting a communiqu from the Public
    Relations Department of the General Public Prosecutor s Office. News of
    the executions, names, and charges against defendants are reflected in
    this communiqu . Additional information is based on several electronic
    forms sent to Omid by persons familiar with this case. Ms. Mansureh
    Moheban is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No. 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. According to the existing information, Ms. Moheban, 17, was born
    in Esfahan on April 9, 1964. She was single and a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Her friends remember Ms. Moheban as a kind
    person who always helped others. International laws have strictly
    prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18
    at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil
    and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran
    has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed
    before the age of eighteen. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary, and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam to their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a
    split within the Marxist-Leninist section of the MKO in 1977. In January
    of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to
    recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution
    and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were primary in the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic s leaders. * Arrest and detention
    According to electronic forms, Ms. Moheban had been arrested three times
    for her political activities with the Mojahedin Khalq between 1980 and
    1981. She was released twice. The last time, it was in the summer of 1981,
    when Revolutionary Guards attacked the house where she was hiding and
    arrested her in a street where she tried to escape barefoot. She was
    detained at Seyedalikhan prison in Kamalesma il Street in Esfahan for
    several months. She had no contact with her family. She was denied access
    to an attorney. Trial No information is available on Ms. Moheban s trial.
    According to the communiqu by Public Relations of the General Public
    Prosecutor s Office, the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Esfahan condemned
    Ms. Moheban and 25 others to death. Charges According to the communiqu of
    the Public Relations Department of the General Public Prosecutor s Office,
    the charges against Ms. Moheban and 25 others were collectively announced
    as those who, armed act against the Islamic Republic regime in Iran;

    grenades and Molotov cocktails; robbery of motorcycles and car plates for
    assassination of Revolutionary Guards; forging stamps for marriage
    certificates and identification cards; and set fire to cars belonging to
    official institutions and Muslim and responsible individuals. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
