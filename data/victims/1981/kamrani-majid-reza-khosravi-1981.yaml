    The execution of Mr. Majid Reza Khosravi Kamrani, son of Nasrollah, along
    with 18 others, was published in the Keyhan and Jomhuri Eslami newspapers
    on August 16, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Revolutionary
    Prosecution Office of Tehran issued a communiqué about these executions
    and released it to the Pars news agency. Mr. Khosravi Kamrani is one of
    the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on
    the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. The Peykar magazine (No. 118 dated
    September 14, 1981) published a short article about him, and an individual
    close to him sent additional information about him to Omid via an
    electronic form. Furthermore, Mr. Khosravi Kamrani is among the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According
    to Peykar , Mr. Khosravi Kamrani was born in 1960. He was very intelligent
    and at age 15 he graduated from high school with honors. He traveled to
    the United States of America to continue his education and started his
    political activism in International Student Confederation, along other
    Iranian students. One of his comrades appreciates the fact that at the
    time of his arrest, Mr. Khosravi Kamrani gave this comrade’s phone number
    to a friend who later informed him of Mr. Khosravi Kamrani’s arrest.
    Consequently, this comrade escaped before the authorities could arrest him
    as well ( Peykar ). A friend notes that, “Majid was a young man with
    dreams of being involved with large projects. He had no idea what the real
    world was.” The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention Based on the available information, Mr.
    Khosravi Kamrani was arrested in Tehran at 1:00 a.m. on August 12, 1981.
    He was detained at Evin Prison and reportedly spent only a few of days in
    detention before being executed Trial No specific information is available
    on Mr. Khosravi Kamrani’s trial, but he was reportedly tried the same day
    that he was arrested (based on the electronic form). Charges According to
    the communiqué of the Public Prosecution Office, Mr. Khosravi Kamrani was
    an “active member of the propaganda section of the Peykar Organization,
    which opposed the nation. He used his employment at the C.P.Q. Trading
    Company as a disguise for his political activity.” Mr. Khosravi Kamrani
    and 18 others were also collectively charged with “attacking innocent
    people, assault and battery, murder, frequenting the safe houses,
    activities aimed at overthrowing the Islamic Republic regime, planning to
    assassinate officials, intending to carry out plans for world imperialism
    led by the US.” The communiqué does not mention the personal charges
    brought against any single defendant. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Khosravi
    Kamrani’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced
    Mr. Khosravi Kamrani to death. He was executed at dawn, on August 15, 1981
    in Evin Prison.
