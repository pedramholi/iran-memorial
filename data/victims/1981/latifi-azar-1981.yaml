    Information about Ms. Azar Latifi has been taekn from an electronic form
    sent to Omid by a former cellmate. She was a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization. She had a petite body, she was quiet and did not speak
    much. She sang beautifully. One night she sang a heartbreaking song, for
    which other cellmates always remembered her. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly
    in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention Ms.
    Latifi was arrested around mid-November in 1981. The details of her arrest
    are not known. She was interrogated at Branch 6 of the Prosecutor’s Office
    in Evin prison. She was kept incommunicado and was denied the right to
    have an attorney and access to her file. She was detained for a only a few
    days in the ward known as “sanitarium,” room 6 in section 240. Trial There
    is no information regarding this trial. Charges The charges brought
    against the defendant are not known. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Ms. Latifi’s defense. Judgment On
    December 6, 1981, her name was called in the afternoon. She left the cell
    and never returned. At around 8:30 p.m., her cellmates heard the noise of
    the firing squad, followed by single-shots (To ensure the death of
    prisoners, sometimes they were shot a single-shot after the firing squad
    had fired). Her cellmates counter 86 single-shots, which may mean that she
    was executed along with 85 other individuals.
