    was a kind, calm, and good-spirited people-person who lived a simple life.

    Fazlollah and Monavvar, and six other individuals* was published in Ettela
    at and Kayhan newspapers on June 15, 1981. Additional information about
    this case was obtained from Ettela at newspaper (June 17, and July 9,
    1981); documents published on the Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran
    website including his letter and the letter of two of his co-defendants to
    their families (June 13, 1981); his letter of introduction; the defense
    written by the [city of] Hamedan Spiritual Assembly members (February 11,
    1981); a Revolutionary Guardsman s testimony on his and his co-defendants
    behalf; Baha is National Spiritual Assembly of the United States Andalib
    (Winter 1990); Iran Wire website (September 7, 2014); the Baha i News
    videos on a YouTube channel (June 11, 2016); Baha is in the Media website
    (December 2008-January 2009); Gooya News website (April 28, 2015); and
    Martyrs of the Baha i Faith website (February 9, 2013). Mr. Khozain was
    born into a Baha i family in [the city of] Kashan in 1917-18. He was
    married but did not have any children. Mr. Khozain had a high school
    diploma and had a radio and television repair shop in Hamedan s bazaar.
    People close to him described him as a kind, calm, and good-spirited
    people-person who lived a simple life. He liked music and played the
    violin. As a child, he moved to other cities with his family because of
    the problems the people living in the region created for him and his
    family. In the late 1930 s, he moved to Hamedan in order to promote the
    Baha i faith, was elected to that city s Spiritual Assembly** for about 30
    years, and was the Assembly s secretary for a number of terms. On August
    19, 1979, Mr. Khozain was summoned to Hamedan Islamic Revolutionary Court
    for being a member of Hamedan s Spiritual Assembly, and upon being
    questioned and charged, bail was set for him in the amount of 10 million
    Tumans; he remained in jail for 33 days until the bail was posted. (Baha i
    News; Martyrs of the Baha i Faith website; Archives of Baha i Persecution
    in Iran). This case is related to the arrest of 7 members of the Hamedan s
    Baha i Spiritual Assembly** in 1980. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic
    of Iran: Background The Baha i religious community is the largest minority
    group in Iran, with approximately 300,000 members in 1979 (more current
    figures are not available).*** The authorities of the Islamic Republic
    have subjected Baha is religious to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence. **** Arrest and detention Mr. Khozain was arrested
    on August 9, 1980, on an arrest warrant issued by the Revolutionary Court,
    and was temporarily released on August 11, and told to return in three
    days. Before the end of the 3-day period, however, he and several other
    members of the Hamedan Baha i Spiritual Assembly were arrested on August
    12, 1980, by members of the Islamic Republic of Iran Revolutionary Guards
    Corps. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran, Iran Wire). Mr. Khozain
    spent 21 days at the Revolutionary Guards detention center and was
    subsequently transferred to the Police Force prison. He endured physical
    torture during detention. Mr. Khozain was denied visitations for 3 months
    after his arrest. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran). His and his
    co-defendants cell was located next to the ward toilets and was so small
    that they had to take turns sleeping. According to handwritten notes
    obtained from one of Mr. Khozain s co-defendants, they were incarcerated
    in a dirty and polluted environment and were deprived of the most basic
    health and hygiene requirements, including showering . According to this
    person, in order to combat lice and other pollutants, they used [bleach,
    detergents,] and heavy duty chemical cleansers multiple times a day. (Iran
    Wire). Mr. Khozain s and his co-defendants families wrote numerous letters
    to Iran s government officials and judicial authorities in order to have
    them lift their visitation ban. According to the families of Mr. Khozain s
    co-defendants, the prison guards did not allow the prisoners and their
    families to speak to one another in their first visitation. Mr. Khozain
    and his ward mates were allowed two visitations per week with their
    families. (Iran Wire). According to the spouse of one of Mr. Khozain s
    co-defendants, in the first two weeks of visitations, only the prisoners
