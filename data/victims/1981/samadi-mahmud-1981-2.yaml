    News of the execution of Mr. Mahmud Samadi, along with another person, was
    published in the Peykar publication (No. 95 February 23, 1981 and No. 97,
    March 9, 1981). Mr. Samadi is one of the 430 “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of 400
    members and sympathizers of the organization who have been executed. The
    book From an Ebullient Ideal , published by the sympathizers of the Peykar
    Organization in August of 1985, also reports this execution. Mr. Samadi
    was born in Abadan in 1955. He was a student of School of Education at
    Tehran University. Mr. Samadi was a co-founder of the student section of
    Peykar. He was in charge of the Peykar student section in Abadan. The
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by
    a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention According to Peykar , Mr. Samadi was arrested in Mahshahr on
    December 24, 1980, 37 days before his execution. His death certificate
    states that signs of torture were seen on his body. Trial Mr. Samadi was
    tried in the Mahshahr Islamic Revolutionary Court. Charges According to
    the Peykar Organization’s reports, Mr. Samadi was charged with “propaganda
    against the Iran-Iraq war and organizing the war victims’ movement.”
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Samadi’s defense. Judgment Mr. Samadi
    was executed by firing squad in Mahshahr on February 2, 1981. His body was
    buried in the Beheshabad cemetery in Ahvaz.
