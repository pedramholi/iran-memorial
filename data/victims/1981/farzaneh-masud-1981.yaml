    The execution of Mr. Mas’ud Farzaneh, son of Ali, from Masjed Soleiman
    (Khuzestan province) and resident of Esfehan, along with another
    individual, was announced in the Jomhuri Eslami on June 28, 1981. He is
    also is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr.
    Farzaneh was a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and
    was active mainly in the political arena and the labor movement. It is not
    clear whether or not Mr. Farzaneh belonged to this branch of the
    Organization. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial According to the news report,
    Branch 5 of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Esfehan held several
    sessions to examine the defendant’s case. No other information is
    available about the trial. Charges Based on Jomhuri Eslami , the charges
    brought against Mr. Farzaneh were: “active membership of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization, activism in demonstrations, disrupting public order,
    causing insecurity and mistrust, transportation of confidential letters of
    the Organization, distribution of counter-Revolutionary leaflets, as well
    as active and passive roles in the act of sodomy”. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution mentions “reading the evidence documented in the file and
    hearing the confessions of the accused.” No further information is
    available. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    The news report states that the Tribunal delivered the verdict, having
    heard the defense of the accused. No other information is available about
    the defense. Judgment Branch 5 of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Esfehan condemned Mr. Mas’ud Farzaneh to death as a “corruptor on earth.”
    According to the Mojahed magazine, he was executed by a firing squad on
    June 28, 1981.
