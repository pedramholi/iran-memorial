    Information about Mr. Mohsen Sarkhosh has been drawn from an electronic
    form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. Ms. Sarkhosh
    is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Based on
    the available information, Mr. Sarkhosh was affiliated with the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. His father, a police officer, was killed in an armed
    struggle with drug smugglers when he was young. His mother raised her four
    children as a single parent with pension of her husband and worked in
    people s houses as a cleaner. Mr. Sarkhosh had two brothers, both of whom
    were killed. His younger brother, Hassan, died under torture a month
    before Mohsen s execution. His older brother, Jahanbakhsh, was hanged in
    1988 during the mass executions of political prisoners. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Sarkhosh s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial There is no information regarding this trial. Charges The
    charges brought against the defendant are not known. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available concerning Sarkhosh s
    defense. Judgment No specific information is available about the verdict
    leading to this execution. Mr. Mohsen Sarkhosh was shot by a firing squad
    on September 12, 1981. The sender of an electronic form quoted a witness
    saying: when [Jahanbakhsh Sarkhosh s] two brothers were executed, Jahan
    himself washed their bodies in [the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in Tehran].
    Jahan told me that their faces, jaws, and teeth had been shattered by the
    bullets. Jahan s mother was screaming [as if wounded], unlike anything I
    had ever seen, and was saying: How could you do this to me? I raised these
    kids by doing people s laundry. How could you do this to me? I hope you
    all burn in hell. I hope your Imam burns in hell.
