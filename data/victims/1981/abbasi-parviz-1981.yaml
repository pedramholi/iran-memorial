    The execution of Mr. Parviz Abbasi, son of Seyfollah, was announced in the
    Keyhan newspaper on July 11, 1981. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Parviz Abbasi were announced as “armed rebellion
    against the Islamic Republic, rioting, membership in the Central Committee
    of the Peykar Organization in the south, and Coordinator in Fars, Bushehr,
    and Bandar Abbas provinces [sic].” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Abbasi’s
    defense. Judgment The court identified Mr. Parviz Abbasi “an enemy of God
    and His prophet” and condemned him to death. He was executed by a firing
    squad in Shiraz on July 8, 1981.
