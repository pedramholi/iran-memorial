    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Ronaqi (Roghani), along with another
    person, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on August 15, 1981, quoting
    the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Arak, by the Pars news agency. Mr.
    Hossein Ronaqi (Roghani) is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear
    on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This
    list contains the names of those members of the organization who died
    after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this
    list have been executed. Mr. Hossein Ronaqi is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Hossein Ronaqi were announced as,
    “participation in the explosion of Qom railroad in the current year
    (1981), organizing resistance cells in Samsami High School in Arak, and
    recruiting innocent youngsters for the Peykar Organization, masterminding
    unrest and clashes in Samsami High School during the previous year, armed
    uprising against the Islamic Republic, and believing in all positions set
    by the mentioned organization.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hossein
    Ronaqi's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Arak
    identified Mr. Hossein Ronaqi as "Mohareb (fighter) against God and the
    Prophet, Mofsed (corruptor on Earth), and Mortad (apostate)." He was
    condemned to death and the Supreme Judicial Council confirmed the ruling.
    He was executed in Arak on August 15, 1981 at dawn.
