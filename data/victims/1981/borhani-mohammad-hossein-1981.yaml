    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Hossein Borhani, son of Mohammad,
    and 34 other individuals, was published in Kayhan newspaper on Monday,
    September 28, 1981, quoting the communiqu of the Office of Public
    Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office. The
    names and crimes of the accused have been stated in this communiqu . Mr.
    Borhani is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Based on available information, Mr. Borhani was a supporter of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as
    its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam
    was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Borhani s arrest and detention are unknown. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. According to the communiqu of the
    Office of Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General
    s Office, the Tabriz Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal tried Mr. Borhani and
    34 other individuals. Charges The Office of Public Relations of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office has stated the charges
    brought against Mr. Mohammad Hossein Borhani and 6 others as being
    organizing and establishing contact with other Hypocrites (derogatory term
    used by the Islamic Republic to describe the MKO) while in prison and
    creating disorder [therein.] The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Borhani. Defense No information is available on Mr. Borhani's defense.
    Judgment Mr. Mohammad Hossein Borhani had previously been sentenced to a
    prison term at an unspecified time and based on unknown charges.
    Subsequently, however, he was tried again and the Tabriz Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal found him guilty of the new afore-mentioned charges
    and sentenced him to death.The sentence was carried out between Wednesday,
    September 23, and Friday, September 25, 1981, in [the city of] Tabriz and
    he was shot by a firing squad. Mr. Borhani was 22 years old.
    _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
