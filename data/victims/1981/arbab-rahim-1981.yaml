    The news about the execution of Colonel Rahim Arbab, along with that of 60

    the earth from corruption (Quran Karim). Those who have not embraced faith
    and are combating in an idolatrous path are forming rank against pious
    people, and, by martyring the best and purest men, are attesting to the
    fact that they are mercenaries of the great powers. It is the duty of you
    pious men to stand up against them and uproot infidelity and hypocrisy.
