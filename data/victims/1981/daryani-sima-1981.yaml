    The information about Ms. Sima Daryani has been sent to Omid via an
    electronic form by her former cellmate, who knew her since they studied at
    university. Ms. Daryani is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Ms. Daryani, born in Babolsar (Mazandaran province)
    on June 27, 1952, studied at Social Sciences School of Tehran University.
    She was very kind and had a good sense of humor. One of her characteristic
    was her laughter, when she laughed one could see her teeth that were
    slightly bent forward. She had metal braces on her teeth. She enjoyed
    activities and a regular in hiking projects, organized by university
    students. Hiking would be n Fridays and occasionally, the students would
    go to various mountainous areas in the country. Ms. Daryani loved nature.
    She would go hiking despite her heart disease and detrimental effect of
    high altitude on her health. She had a beautiful voice and she would sing
    songs by Delkash (an Iranian singer) and Mazandaran folklore songs. Sima
    Daryani became interested in the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization before the
    Revolution and was a sympathizer. After the Revolution she became more
    active in the Organization. She had many friends from various political
    groups but she would not let politics interfere with friendship; she was
    an emotional and gentle person. Before her arrest, she lived with her
    cousin in Tehran. The Fadayian Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist
    group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of
    Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, split
    over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union; and
    most members renounced armed struggle. A number of the Organization’s
    members, who did not renounce armed struggle, founded the group the
    Fadayian Khalq Guerillas (Ashraf Dehqan Branch). Arrest and detention At
    the time of arrest, Ms. Sima Daryani had a cyanide capsule and intended to
    swallow it so that she would die before arrest. (At that time members of
    some political organizations, including Fadaiyan Khalq and Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, carried cyanide capsules under their tongues so in case of
    arrest, they would swallow it and die before arrest; the objective was to
    die before one might disclose any confidential information under torture.)
    When the Revolutionary Guards arrested Ms. Daryani, they quickly and
    forcefully held her hands and forced their own hand into her mouth to
    prevent her from swallowing the cyanide capsule. Ms. Daryani was arrested
    along with her roommate and cousin on November 24, 1981. They were both
    taken to Evin prison and interrogated in Branch 6 of Evin’s Prosecutor’s
    Office. Ms. Daryani was flogged and cuffed with steelyard handcuffs called
    “qapan”. Her feet were swollen and infected due to being flogged. After
    her interrogation and trial, which altogether lasted only 5 days, she was
    sent to the medical clinic section of Evin. Throughout her detention she
    was denied the right to have an attorney, access to her file; she did not
    have any visits with her family. “Qapan (steelyard handcuff) was a common
    torture method during interrogations. In this method, the prisoner was
    handcuffed using the steelyard behind the back with one arm reaching the
    other from above the head. The pressure usually resulted in fractions in
    the shoulder blade. To make it more effective, the prisoner was usually
    suspended in the air using the steelyard.” Trial There is no information
    regarding this trial. Charges The charges brought against the defendant
    are not known. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning
    the evidence presented against the accused. Defense Ms. Daryani was denied
    the right to be represented by an attorney and to have access to her file.
    Judgment Around 2 p.m. on an autumn day, Ms. Sima Daryani’s name was
    called along with another prison, Nahid Mohammadi (who was executed the
    same day). It took another hour before they were taken outside away. Ms.
    Daryani’s cousin was crying and did not want to say goodbye. Ms. Daryani
    spent her last hour in the cell with a friend from the university, who was
    then her cellmate. This cellmate wrote: “We went outside to get some fresh
    air. The [prison] yard was very small and located behind the kitchen. That
    day the air smelt like burnt cooking oil. It was drizzling. We walked in
    the yard for about an hour. As we spoke, it felt like she was telling me
    her will. She asked me to take care of her cousin, who was younger than
    her and whose mother had passed away. She told me that during the
    interrogation she defended her political views and she wanted me to tell
    her
