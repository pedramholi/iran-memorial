    News of the execution of Mr. Kazem Kazeruni, son of Mohammad, along with
    four others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on July 27, 1981. Mr.
    Kazem Kazeruni is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. According to this source, Mr. Kazem
    Kazeruni was a high school graduate, married, a teacher, and a sympathizer
    of the Fadaiyan Organization. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly in the
    political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial The
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kerman tried Mr. Kazem Kazeruni, but no
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Kazem Kazeruni were announced as, armed uprising against the
    Islamic Republic of Iran, sympathizing with and offering practical support
    for a deviant and destructive group of Fadaiyan Khalq Minority that is in
    war with Islam, and distribution of its publications. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Kazem Kazeruni's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Kerman identified Mr. Kazem Kazeruni as "Baghi
    (rebel), Mofsed (corruptor on Earth), Mohareb (fighter) against God and
    the Prophet, and Mortad (apostate)." He was condemned to death. The ruling
    was carried out when he was executed by firing squad in Kerman on July 26,
    1981 at 5 am. No specific information is available about the defendant s
    execution. The Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor Office of Kerman
    announced that, because the executed individuals are apostate, they have
    no right to be buried in the Moslem cemetery.
