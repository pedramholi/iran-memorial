    News of the execution of Mr. Abbas Mohseni Mashhadi, son of Mahmud, along
    with eighteen others, was published in Keyhan and Jomhuri Eslami
    newspapers on August 16, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the
    Revolutionary and Public Prosecution Office of Tehran issued an
    announcement about this execution and released it to the Pars news agency.
    Mr. Mohseni Mashhadi is also one of the 430 individuals whose names appear
    on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This
    list contains the names of those members of the organization who died
    after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this
    list have been executed. He is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The communiqu of the
    Central Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office, which calls the convicts sworn
    agents of the superpowers , begins with a reference to the Koran: It is
    but a just recompense for those who make war on God and His apostle and
    endeavor to spread corruption on earth, that they are being slain in great
    numbers, or crucified in great numbers, or have, in result of their
    perverseness, their hands and feet cut off in great numbers, or are being
    [entirely] banished from [the face of] the earth: such is their ignominy
    in this world . But in the life to come [yet more] awesome suffering
    awaits them [5:33]. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Mohseni Mashhadi are collective, vague, and include
    eighteen other defendants. In the announcement by the Central
    Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor s Office there is no reference to a
    specific crime committed by any single defendant. The announcement charges
    Mr. Mohseni Mashhadi with being "a sympathizer of the Peykar
    Organization." It also states some collective charges such as, "attacking
    innocent people, assault and battery, and murder, frequenting the
    organization's houses, activities for overthrowing the Islamic Republic
    regime, planning to assassinate officials, and intending to carry out
    plans for world imperialism headed by the US." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mohseni Mashhadi's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Mohsenin Mashhadi to death. He
    was executed in the Evin prison yard in Tehran on August 15, 1981.
