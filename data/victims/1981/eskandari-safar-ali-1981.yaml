    Little is known about Mr. Eskandari, except the fact that he was executed
    for having sex with another man in prison. The execution of Mr. Safar Ali
    Eskandari, son of Akbar, along with Mr. Ebadollah Ebadi, was announced in
    the Kayhan newspaper on May 5, 1981 and the Enqelab Eslami newspaper on
    May 6. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial other than he was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tabriz. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Eskandari was
    sodomy. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the newspaper reports, the
    evidence against him consisted of his own confessions, and the testimony
    of the witnesses, and a physician. Defense No information is available on
    his defense. Judgment According to the newspaper, the two individuals who
    had been imprisoned due to one count of manslaughter, were charged with
    the act of sodomy and condemned to death. This incident is also reported
    by Kayhan . Mr. Safar Ali Eskandari, along his co-defendant, was executed
    by a firing squad on May 4, 1981 in Tabriz.
