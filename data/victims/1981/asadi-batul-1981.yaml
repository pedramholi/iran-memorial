    Information about Ms. Batul Asadi is based on two electronic forms sent to
    Omid by a person familiar with her case. She is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No. 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According to the
    existing information, Ms. Asadi, 24, born in Arak or Tehran, was a biology
    student at Mashhad University. She was married, a political activist
    during the time of the Shah, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization since 1977. She married Mr. Eslam Qal esari, a resident of
    Gorgan in 1979. Her friends remember Ms. Asadi as a kind, honest, smart,
    and beautiful woman. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam to be their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology.
    In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were
    imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a split within the
    Marxist-Leninist section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the
    imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along with other
    political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to recruit new
    members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    primary in the organization s agenda. During the first two years after the
    Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic s leaders. * Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    According to the electronic forms, Ms. Asadi and her husband, Mr. Qal
    esari, were arrested in Rasht in 1981 for cooperating with the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. They were tortured at Rasht Prison. Trial No
    information is available on Ms. Asadi s trial. Charges The charge brought
    against Ms. Asadi is not known. According to one electronic form, the
    charges against her were, Mohareb [fighter against God], and Monafeq
    [hypocrite]. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against Ms. Asadi.
    Defense No information is available on Ms. Asadi s defense. Judgment
    According to existing information, Ms. Batul Asadi was executed by a
    firing squad, along with her husband, Mr. Qal esari, in Rasht on November
    17, 1981. According to their wishes, they were both buried in the forest.
    ________________________ * The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981,
    the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and
    assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the
    Islamic regime. In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the
    impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they
    founded the National Counc
