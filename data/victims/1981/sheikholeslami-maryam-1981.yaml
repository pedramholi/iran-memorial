    Information about Ms. Maryam Sheikholeslami is based on electronic forms
    sent to Omid by persons familiar with this case. Ms. Sheikholeslami is
    also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)* in
    1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. According to this information, Ms. Sheikholeslami, 23, was born
    in Tehran or Malayer in 1957. Her family were from Malayer. She entered
    the Shahid Beheshti (Melli) University in 1975 and studied as a sociology
    major. She was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    to be their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to a split within the Marxist-Leninist section
    of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of
    the MKO were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were primary in the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, whether by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic s
    leaders. * Arrest and detention The circumstances of Ms. Sheikholeslami s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available
    regarding Ms. Sheikholeslami s trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Ms. Sheikholeslami is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Ms. Sheikholeslami. Defense No information is available concerning
    Ms. Sheikholeslami s defense. Judgment There is no information on the
    verdict leading to this execution. According to the existing information,
    Ms. Maryam Sheikholeslami was executed in 1981. _________________________
    * The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of
    their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic
    Republic authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap
    between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin
    as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
    treatment by governmental officials and the government officials efforts
    to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact
    that the regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and
    Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from this
    demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were arrested
    and executed in the following days and weeks. The day after the
    demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a repressive campaign
    unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and
    sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO
    announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and assassinated
    a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the Islamic regime.
    In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the impeached President
    (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they founded the National
    Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many of its members were
    expelled fromFrance, they went toIraqand founded the National Liberation
    Army of Iran in 1987, which entered Iranian territory a few times during
    the Iran-Iraq war. They were defeated in July 1988 during their last
    operation, the Forugh Javidan Operation. A few days after this operation,
    thousands of imprisoned Mojahedin supporters were killed during t
