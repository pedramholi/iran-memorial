    information regarding the reasons for this summons. Simultaneously,
    several other members of Hamedan s Spiritual Assembly were summoned or

    to the arrest of 7 members of the Hamedan s Baha i Spiritual Assembly** in
    1980. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The Baha i
    religious community is the largest minority group in Iran, with
    approximately 300,000 members in 1979 (more current figures are not
    available).*** The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected Baha
    is religious to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of
    their most fundamental human rights. The Baha i religion is not recognized
    under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities
    refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha is have been denied the
    rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot
    profess and practice their faith and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence. **** Arrest and detention Mr. Vafa i was arrested on August
    9, 1980, on an arrest warrant issued by the Revolutionary Court, and was
    temporarily released on August 11, and told to return in three days.

    of the Hamedan Baha i Spiritual Assembly were arrested on August 12, 1980,
    by members of the Islamic Republic of Iran Revolutionary Guards Corps.
    (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran; Iran Wire). Mr. Vafa i spent 21
    days at the Revolutionary Guards detention center and was subsequently
    transferred to the Police Force prison. He endured physical torture during
    detention. Mr. Vafa i was denied visitations for 3 months after his
    arrest. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran). His and his
    co-defendants cell was located next to the ward toilets and was so small
    that they had to take turns sleeping. According to handwritten notes
    obtained from one of Mr. Motlaq s co-defendants, they were incarcerated in
    a dirty and polluted environment and were deprived of the most basic
    health and hygiene requirements, including showering . According to this
    person, in order to combat lice and other pollutants, they used [bleach,
    detergents,] and heavy duty chemical cleansers multiple times a day. (Iran
    Wire). Mr. Vafa i s and his co-defendants families wrote numerous letters
    to Iran s government officials and judicial authorities in order to have
    them lift their visitation ban. According to the families of Mr. Vafa i s
    co-defendants, the prison guards did not allow the prisoners and their
    families to speak to one another in their first visitation. Mr. Vafa i and
    his ward mates were allowed two visitations per week w
