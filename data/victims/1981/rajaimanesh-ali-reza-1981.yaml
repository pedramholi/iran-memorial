    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Reza Raja’imanesh, son of Farajollah,
    along with forty-two others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on
    September 30, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Public
    Prosecutor’s Office announced these executions, the defendants' names and
    their charges, and released this to the media. Mr. Raja’imanesh is also
    one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of
    the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published
    on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. Additionally, he is one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to the above announcement, the charges against Mr.
    Raja’imanesh were “membership in military teams, active participation in
    armed demonstrations generally resulting in assault and battery and murder
    of innocent people, activity in propaganda groups, murdering a
    Revolutionary Guard, and membership in the Peykar Organization.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Raja’imanesh's defense. Judgment The
    Central Islamic Revolutionary Court condemned Mr. Raja’imanesh to death.
    He was executed on September 29, 1981, at dawn.
