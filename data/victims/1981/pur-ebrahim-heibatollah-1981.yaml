    Mr. Ebrahim Heibatollah Pur is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The addendum includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Supplemental information about Mr. Heibatollah Pur,
    son of Khani Aqa, is based on an electronic form sent to the Boroumand
    Foundation by his brother. According to this information, he was born on
    January 27, 1962 in Susan village near Izeh. He left Izeh for Masjed
    Soleiman in 1977 in order to continue his education towards earning a
    technical electrician diploma. Mr. Heibatollah Pur was politically active
    during the revolution. After the revolution, he joined the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization and continued his political activities. Mr. Heibatollah Pur
    was Muslim but not religious. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members’ interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah’s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization’s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention According to the
    electronic form provided to the Boroumand Foundation, Mr. Heibatollah Pur
    was arrested in Masjed Soleiman, most probably on August 29, 1981 at dawn.
    He was detained for 13 days and had only one visitation with his father
    for a few minutes during which he was shackled. The sender of the
    electronic form believes that Mr. Heibatollah Put was severely tortured
    while in detention. Trial According to the information in the electronic
    form, Mr. Heibatollah Pur was tried in Masjed Soleiman behind closed doors
    and his family were not allowed to attend his trial. He was not allowed to
    appeal the court’s decision. Charges According to the electronic form, the
    charges against Mr. Heibatollah Pur were announced as “waging a war
    against God and cooperation with Monafeqin (Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization).” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the electronic form, the
    Mojahedin’s pamphlets were the only evidence provided against Mr.
    Heibatollah Pur. Defense According to the above-mentioned source, Mr.
    Heibatollah Pur was denied the right to have an attorney. Judgment Based
    on the addendum to the Mojahed magazine, Mr. Heibatollah Pur was executed
    by a firing squad on September 2, 1981 in Masjed Soleiman.
    _______________________________________________________________________
    *The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of
    their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic
    Republic authorities’ different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap
    between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin
    as “Hypocrites” and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
    treatment by governmental officials and the government officials’ efforts
    to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact
    that the regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and
    Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from this
    demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were arrested
