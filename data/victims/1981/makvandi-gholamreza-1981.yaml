    Mr. Gholam Reza Makvandi (Peykar) is one of the 12028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a social
    imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Makvandi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    No information is available on Mr. Makvandi s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Makvandi is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Makvandi s defense. Judgment There is no information on the verdict
    leading to this execution.
