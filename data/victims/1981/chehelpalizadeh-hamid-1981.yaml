    The execution of Mr. Hamid Chehelpolizadeh, son of Rajab Ali, along with
    three other individuals, was announced in a communiqué of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Masjed Soleyman (Khuzestan province), published in
    the Keyhan newspapers on December 23, 1981. The Public Relations
    Department of the Central Revolutionary Public Prosecutor’s Office issued
    another communiqué regarding the execution of Mr. Hamid Chehelpolizadeh
    and four other individuals on December 27, 1981. Mr. Chehelpolizadeh is
    also one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs
    of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class”
    published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the
    names of those members of the organization who died after the revolution
    of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed.
    Moreover, he is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Additionally, Ms. Nahid Nosrat refers to Mr.
    Chehelpolizadeh in an article published in the first volume of the book
    The Inescapable Escape . According to report of the Peykar Organization,
    Mr. Chehelpolizadeh was from Shushtar (Khuzestan province) and had been
    imprisoned during the previous regime. This same report states that he had
    a “bachelor’s degree in agriculture, but he could not find a job after the
    Revolution. Thus he started working in a shop that repaired radio and
    television sets.” The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial, other than he
    was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Masjed Soleyman.
    Charges Mr. Chehelpolizadeh was charged with “Sympathizing with the
    American Organization of Peykar and having contact with the high level
    members of the organization.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Chehelpolizadeh’s
    defense. The Peykar report states that he “proudly defended his political
    convictions.” Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Masjed Soleyman
    recognized Mr. Hamid Chehelpolizadeh a “corruptor on earth, a rebel
    against the Imam and the regime of the Islamic Republic, and an apostate,”
    and condemned him to death. The Peykar report refers to the statements of
    an executioner, saying: “At the time of the execution, the head of the
    [Revolutionary] Guards told Hamid Chehelpolizadeh: ‘Repent sp you won’t go
    to hell.’ But [Hamid’s] reply was: ‘I don’t believe in your heaven and
    hell.’” Mr. Chehelpolizadeh was executed in Shushtar on December 21, 1981
    at midnight.
