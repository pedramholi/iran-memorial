    The news about execution of Mr. Alireza Ahangari was announced by the
    public relations office of the prosecutor general of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court which was published in Jomhouri Eslami newspaper on
    November 22, 1981. According to this press release Mr. Ahangari along with
    17 other rebels that were members of the Monafeqin group were executed in
    four cities and faced the material outcome of their disgraceful acts. Mr.
    Ahangari is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Additional information about Mr. Ahangari is based on an
    electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with
    this case. According to this information, he was born into a middle-class
    family and his father was a laborer for municipality. One of Mr. Ahangari
    s brothers was killed during the clashes in Amol. Based on the addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine, he was 30 years old at the time of his execution. He
    was single and a student. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention According to the
    information sent to the Boroumand Foundation, Mr. Ahangari was arrested in
    Bandar-e Gaz and then transferred to the vicinity of the Revolutionary
    Guards. Trial According to the information sent to the Boroumand
    Foundation, Mr. Ahangari was executed without any trial. Charges According
    to the press release by the public relations office of the prosecutor
    general of the Islamic Revolutionary Court, Mr. Ahangari along with 17
    other members and sympathizers of the terrorist grouplet of Monafeqin were
    found guilty of armed opposition to the regime of the Islamic Republic of
    Iran, being corruptors on earth, waging a war against God and his Prophet,
    and for being rebellious, and were sentenced to death by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Courts. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available about Mr. Ahangari s
    defense. Judgment According to the information sent to the Boroumand
    Foundation, Mr. Ahangari was executed by a firing squad behind a poultry
    farm in Bandar-e Gaz. According to the press release by the public
    relations office of the prosecutor general of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court and the addendum to Mojahed magazine, he was executed on November
    18, 1981. -------------------------- *The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, Pr
