    A supporter of the Tudeh, Ms. Alishahi was unusually bashful and quiet.
    Sometimes she wore a full smile. Sometimes a half. The information about
    Ms. Gita Alishahi has been drawn from Ms. Zoya Amin s interview with a
    former classmate of Ms. Alishahi from Tehran University, published on the
    website of Radio Zamaaneh (Oct. 5, 2008). Her name is also mentioned in
    the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party. Additionally, her execution,
    along with 42 other individuals, was announced in a communiqu of the
    Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office (Sep. 30, 1981). This
    communiqu states: These heartless leeches intend to prevent the
    ever-present nation [of Islam] from combating world imperialism, through
    schemes and plots, creating unrest, riots, and clashes on the streets.
    [They] fight against Islam and Muslims by setting fire to public
    properties, attacking defenseless people, causing them injury and death,
    destruction, explosions, and other violent and inhuman acts. In September
    1979, Ms. Alishahi majored in Mathematics and studied at the School of
    Education of Tehran University, intending to become a teacher. Her
    classmate writes: Gita was shy and bashful. She had thick black hair that
    she tied [in a ponytail], with bangs on her forehead. She did not wear
    make-up. Her skin was as white as moonlight, her eyes black. She always
    had a smile on her red lips; sometimes a full smile and sometimes just
    half a smile. She wore simple men s shirts, olive color with two pockets,
    and trousers. According to her classmate, Ms. Alishahi started her
    political activities in the fall of 1979 and was a sympathizer of the
    Tudeh Party (Radio Zamaneh). The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941.
    The Tudeh s ideology was Marxist-Leninist, and it supported the former
    Soviet Union s policies. The Party played a major role in Iran s political
    landscape, until it was banned for a second time following the coup of
    August 19, 1953. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh declared Ayatollah
    Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime to be revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Tudeh never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of its
    attacks in 1982, when most of its leaders and members were imprisoned.
    Arrest and detention According to the available information, on the day of
    her arrest (Sep. 27, 1981), Ms. Alishahi ran into her classmate on Villa
    Street in Tehran. She told her classmate that she taught in the south of
    the city and carried a chador in her bag, which she wore when she was
    close to her workplace.* As Ms. Alishahi and her classmate walked on the
    street, they reached a checkpoint where pedestrians bags were searched.
    Ms. Alishahi mentioned that the Mojahedin Khalq Organization was having a
    demonstration that same day, and she expressed concern that, since she
    carried a chador in her bag, she might be mistakenly taken as a
    sympathizer of this organization. Ms. Alishahi was arrested at the
    checkpoint. Following the repression of the demonstration of June 20,
    1981, which protested the parliament s impeachment of President Banisadr
    and the Islamic Republic s systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization from the country s political scene, and the mass
    executions that followed the demonstration, the MKO turned to armed
    opposition to the regime of the Islamic Republic. The MKO sought to
    organize demonstrations in order to attract public support and overthrow
    the regime. The demonstration of September 27, 1981, was such an event in
    which many of the MKO sympathizers were arrested. According to official
    newspapers, the demonstration resulted in the death of several
    Revolutionary Guards, supporters of the MKO, as well as some bystanders.
    Two days later, the Kayhan newspaper announced the execution of 54
    demonstrators. Trial There is no information regarding this trial. Charges
    The communiqu of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office
    announced the collective charges brought against Ms. Alishahi and 42 other
    individuals: direct participation in recent armed demonstration and street
    clashes, armed attacks against the Party of God (Hezbollah); setting buses
    and other public and private transport vehicles on fire; battery, injury,
    and murder of defenseless people; and the destruction of pubic properties.
    The personal charges against Ms. Alishahi are not known. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    The communiqu of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office
    stated that a large number of arms and weapons, grenades, Molotov
    cocktails, and other war ammunitions were discovered in the possession of
    those named above. Defense No information is available concerning Ms.
    Alishahi s defense. According to the available information, Ms. Alishahi
    did not participate in the demonstration of September 27, 1981. Judgment
