    The information about the execution of Mr. Yadollah Abhesht and 15 other

    Public Prosecutor’s office, published in the newspaper Jomhuri Eslami,
    October 11, 1981. This execution was also reported in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    in 1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Additional information about Mr. Abhesht, born in Hamedan
    and residing in Rasht, was taken from the MKO website. He was a
    sympathizer of this organization. Arrest and detention Mr. Abhesht was
    arrested on July 26, 1981 as he was leaving a Mojahedin base. He was first
    detained in the Revolutionary Guards Station and then in the Evin prison.
    According to the MKO website, he severely tortured, leaving him weak and
    unable to walk. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. According to the MKO website, he was tried four times in two months
    and during each five-minute trial, he was told to either cooperate or face
    execution. Charges Based on the information available on the communiqué,
    Mr. Abhesht, “the head of the Organizational unit in Rasht,” was charged
    with, “Being a member of the Operations and Demolitions Unit of the
    Monafeqin [hypocrites, a name given to the PMIO by the Islamic regime],
    being active and living in team houses, repeated attempts to overthrow the
    Islamic regime, accepting all of the criminal Organization’s [PMIO]
    beliefs, concealing information about the Organization [from the
    interrogators], contacting the heads of the Organization in Gilan.” These
    charges are collective and brought against the defendant and one other
    individual. The prosecution does not mention any specific offense for the
    defendant. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Abhesht's defense. Judgment No specific information is
    available about this execution. According to the Public Prosecutor’s
    communiqué, Mr. Abhesht was declared a “corruptor on earth, a combatant
    against God, and an enemy of the Islamic regime.” He was sentenced to the
    death by the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Rasht and was executed in the
    Evin prison on October 8, 1981. The MKO website quotes his daughter saying
    that he was buried in an unmarked, collective grave allocated for the
    Mojahedin. For years, his family did not know where he was buried.
