    The Public Relations Office of Evin Prison announced the execution of Mr.
    Changiz Arshi (known as Sa id Alizadeh), son of Moharram, and 11 other
    individuals, to the Pars News Agency. The news was published in the Kayhan
    and Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on August 5, 1981. Additional information is
    based on an electronic form sent to Omid by a person familiar with his
    case. Mr. Changiz Arshi is one of the 559 individuals whose name appears
    on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class, published on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list
    contains the names of those members of the Organization who died after the
    Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. This execution was also reported in the addendum of the
    Mojahed magazine, No. 261, dated August 6, 1985, published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The list includes 12,028 individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. According to the information sent to
    Omid, Mr. Changiz Arshi, a resident of Tehran, was a student at Shahid
    Beheshti (Melli) University. He was a Marxist and a member of the Students
    Faction of the Peykar Organization in Northern Tehran. He was a member of
    a political team along with Shahram Jenab, who was also executed with Mr.
    Arshi. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also
    joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third
    Line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla
    struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian
    Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social Imperialist"
    state, which believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist
    principles and radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of
    Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian government, and
    splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982, effectively dismantled the
    Organization and scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no
    longer in existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Arshi s
    arrest and detention are not known. According to the electronic form, he
    was not allowed to have any visitations with his family. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Arshi s trial. According to the Public
    Relations Office of Evin Prison, the Central Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal condemned Mr. Arshi and eleven others. Charges Mr. Arshi was
    charged with armed rebellion, or armed action against the Islamic
    Republic, according to Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami, respectively. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Changiz Arshi.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Arshi's defense. Judgment The
    Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Mr. Changiz Arshi to
    death. According to Mojahed magazine, he was executed on August 4, 1981.
    On August 5, Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami each published the story of the
    execution by firing squad at Evin Prison. According to the electronic
    form, Mr. Arshi was buried in Behesht-e Zahra cemetery.
