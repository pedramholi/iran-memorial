    Information about Mr. Mas ud Abusa idi is based on an electronic form sent
    to Omid by a person familiar with his case. The Public Relations Office of
    Evin Prison announced the execution of Mr. Mas ud Abusa idi, son of
    Gholamreza, along with eleven other individuals, to the Pars News Agency.
    The news was published in the Kayhan and the Johuri Eslami newspapers on
    August 5, 1981. Mr. Abusa idi was born in Semnan in 1957. He was single, a
    high school graduate, and worked in a bookstore. He was a sympathizer of
    the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class. Mr. Abusa
    idi s name appears on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class, published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those members of the
    organization who died after the Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the
    individuals on this list have been executed. This execution was also
    reported in the addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No. 261, dated August 6,
    1985, published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (the Third Line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state, believed that China
    had deviated from Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government, and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982, effectively dismantled the organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention According to information sent to Omid, Mr. Abusa idi was
    arrested, along with his comrades, at the office of the Peykar
    Organization in Tehran on July 29, 1981. He was transferred to Evin
    Prison. His family, who lived in another city, could not get any news of
    him. Mr. Abusa idi was denied access to an attorney or any visitation with
    his family. Trial No information is available on Mr. Abusa idi s trial.
    According to the information sent to Omid, he was not tried. Charges Mr.
    Abusa idi and other individuals, who were executed together, were
    collectively charged with Armed Rebellion against the Islamic Republic or
    Armed Action against the Islamic Republic, according to Kayhan and Jomhuri
    Eslami, respectively. According to information sent to Omid, his only
    charge was for activity in the Peykar Organization. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Abusa idi. Defense No information is
    available about Mr. Abusa idi s defense. Judgment The Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Mr. Mas ud Abusa idi to death, and he was
    executed by a firing squad at Evin Prison on August 5, 1981. No specific
    information is available about the defendant s execution. According to the
    information sent to Omid, and after repeated and unproductive visits by
    Mr. Abusa idi s family to Evin Prison, one day prison officials gave them
    an address with a grave number at Khavaran Cemetery and a will. In his
    will, Mr. Abusa idi wrote, Hello, I hope you are all well and happy. The
    family had to exhume the body secretly in order to verify his identity.
