    The execution of Mr. Qanbar Arghand was announced in a Kayhan report
    published on July 14, 1981 and also in Ettela’at and Jomhouri Eslami
    newspapers on July 15, 1981. Mr. Qanbar Arghand, 26, and a member of the
    Fadayian Khalq Guerrilla Organization is also one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Fadayian Khalq
    Guerrilla Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban
    Revolution and the urban guerrilla movements of Latin America, was founded
    in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following
    the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle,
    split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union.
    A number of the Organization’s members, who did not renounce armed
    struggle, founded the group the Fadayian Khalq Guerrillas (Ashraf Dehqani
    Branch). Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Arghand’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial According to the report in Kayhan the
    Langarud Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal issued Mr. Arghand’s sentence. No
    information is available on Mr. Arghand’s trial. Charges According to the
    report in Kayhan Mr. Arghand was charged with “having a record of vice,
    drawing daggers, attacking Muslim people, attacking Islamic revolutionary
    institutions such as the Bassij and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
    as well as the Islamic Republic Party, inciting fear and panic, and active
    participation in illegal demonstrations of the Hypocrites and the Fadayian
    Khalq Ashraf Dehqani Branch as a paid agent.” Evidence of guilt The report
    of this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against Mr. Arghand. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Arghand’s defense. Judgment The Langarud Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
