    News of the execution of Mr. Jalil Shirkosh, son of Mohammad Ali, and 34
    other individuals, was published in Kayhan newspaper on Monday, September
    28, 1981, quoting the communiqué of the Office of Public Relations of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General’s Office. The names and crimes of
    the accused have been stated in this communiqué. Mr. Shirkosh is also one
    of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Based on available
    information, Mr. Shirkosh was a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members’ interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah’s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization’s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Shorkosh’s arrest
    and detention are unknown. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. According to the communiqué of the Office of Public
    Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General’s Office, the
    Tabriz Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal tried Mr. Shirkosh and 34 other
    individuals. Charges The Office of Public Relations of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor General’s Office has stated the charges brought
    against Mr. Jalil Shirkosh and 27 others as being “working with and being
    actively connected to the Hypocrites (derogatory terms used by the Islamic
    Republic to describe the MKO) organization, taking part in living in safe
    houses, procurement and possession of prohibited arms and explosive
    materials, participation in street demonstrations and skirmishes, approval
    and acceptance of Hypocrites’ position of adopting armed struggle,
    devising plans of terror and spreading fear and insecurity among the
    engaged Moslem people [of Iran], plotting rising against the Islamic
    Republic.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Shirkosh.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Shirkosh’s defense. Judgment
    The Tabriz Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Jalil Shirkosh to
    death. The sentence was carried out between Wednesday, September 23, and
    Friday, September 25, 1981, in [the city of] Tabriz and he was shot by a
    firing squad. Mr. Shirkosh was 21 years old. *The exclusion of MKO members
    from government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing
    houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities’ different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as “Hypocrites” and the
    Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers
    regularly during demonstrations and while distributing publications,
    leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO
    called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental
    officials and the government officials’ efforts to impeach their ally,
    President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called
    this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom
    confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of
    casualties that resulted from this demonstr
