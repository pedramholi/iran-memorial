    The information about Mr. Mohammad Ali Salamian Kashi was drawn from the
    website of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) and from an electronic
    form sent by a close friend. He was born in Tehran in 1965. He lived with
    his family in Tehranpars. This friend remembers that Ali s family was very
    respectful and religious. He was a student at Kharazmi high school. This
    friend remembers that, Ali used to work in [the] summer to save money and
    help needy people. He was one of the most honest kids [that] I have ever
    met in my life. After the revolution, influenced by his older brother and
    sister, he joined the sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    His older brother, Mohammad Hassan, also a MKO sympathizer, was killed
    five months later in 1982. Ali and his Hassan s parents both died soon
    after. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention According
    to the MKO website, Mr. Mohammad Ali Salamian Kashi was arrested by the
    Revolutionary Guards at the age of 16 in a MKO team house along with eight
    others in August 1981. According to this friend, Ali was responsible for
    providing food to a team house for the MKO. One day when he was bringing
    food to this team house, he was arrested. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges No information is available on
    Mr. Salamian Kashi s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available about his defense. Judgment Mr. Mohammad Ali
    Salamian Kashi was executed by a firing squad in August 1981. According to
    the MKO website, he was executed three days after his arrest. He was 16 at
    the time of his execution. -----------------------------------------------
    *The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of
    their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic
    Republic authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap
    between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin
    as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
    treatment by governmental officials and the government officials efforts
    to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact
    that the regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and
    Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from this
    demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were arrested
    and executed in the following days and weeks. The day after the
    demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a repressive campaign
    unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and
    sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO
    announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and assassinated
    a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the Islamic regime.
    In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the impeached President
    (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they founded the National
    Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many of its members were
    expelled from France, they went to Iraq an
