    The news about execution of Mr. Babak Aqbashlu was announced by the public
    relations office of the prosecutor general of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court which was published in Kayhan newspaper on September 28, 1981. The
    press release reads as follows: In the name of God, we are witnessing the
    pre-drowning efforts of the grouplets affiliated with the criminal
    America; those who martyr the brothers of the Revolutionary Guards with
    their savage and inhuman acts and attack the innocent Muslims hoping to
    cause agitation and chaos, to weaken the people, and to damage the Islamic
    Republic Regime, just to avoid their own destruction. His brother, Akbar
    Aqbashlu, and his sister-in-law, Ladan Bayani, were also executed in 1981
    Moreover, Mr. Aqbashlu is also one of the 430 individuals whose names
    appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. This execution was also announced in the addendum of the
    Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated
    with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes
    with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the
    publication date of the magazine. Additional information about Mr.
    Aqbashlu, son of Ali, is based on an electronic form sent to the Boroumand
    Foundation by a person familiar with this case. According to this
    information, Ms. Aqbashlu was born in Tabriz on September 14, 1957. He was
    single and worked as a mechanic. In 1979, he became a member of the Peykar
    Organization. Later in 1980, he and some other individuals split from
    Peykar and joined another group named the Red Star. Attached to the
    electronic form were the handwritten order of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Tabriz to the head of the committee residing at the police
    detention center in Tabriz (dated September 25, 1981) and the report of
    the Ministry of Interior, the police department of the Eastern Azerbaijan
    province (dated September 27, 1981). The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The Red Star group ( Setareh-ye
    Sorkh ), was created by a number of individuals who split from Peykar in
    1980 over tactical disagreements. The group was opposed to the Islamic
    Republic regime, rejected armed struggle, and believed in the fundamental
    role of organizing the industrial and agricultural labor force, and the
    student movement. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government in 1981 caused the dismantling of the Red Star. Arrest and
    detention According to the information sent by the electronic form, Mr.
    Aqbashlu was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards on March 19, 1981, at 5
    AM, in an alley in Tabriz while distributing pamphlets. The guards ordered
    him to stop and he ran attempting to escape. Upon arrest, he was beaten
    and kept in solitary confinement at the Central Committee of the Islamic
    Revolution in Tabriz. According to the electronic form, Mr. Aqbashlu was
    tortured in detention and was subjected to three mock executions. He was
    taken to the top of a hill behind the prison in Tabriz while his hands and
    legs were tied and a metal bucket was placed on his head. Then the
    authorities would shoot in the air and kick him down the hill. Mr.
    Aqbashlu was denied an attorney and was not allowed to see his family
    during the first two months of detention. Trial According to the
    information provided to the Boroumand Foundation, Mr. Aqbashlu was first
    tried by the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz in May of 1981 and was
    condemned to five years imprisonment. After Ayatollah Madani, the leader
    of Friday Prayers in Tabriz was killed on September 8, 1981, Mr. Aqbashlu
    was retried in a two-minute trial session and condemned to death and 260
    lashes. Charges According to the press release by the public relations
    office of prosecutor general for the Islamic Revolutionary Court,
    published in Kayhan newspaper on September 28, 1981, the charges against
    Mr. Aqbashlu and four other individuals were announced as: possession of
    weapons and explosives, rebellion against the regime of the Islamic
    Republic, belief in the armed opposition to the Islamic Republic,
    participation in assassination and explosion plots . The defendants were
    also charged with being part of the American grouplet Peykar. According to
