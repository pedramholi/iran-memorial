    The information about Mr. Sasan Khoshbu’i has been taken from his
    brother’s presentation at the Second International Seminar on the Massacre
    of Iranian Political Prisoners, held in Köln, Germany, in August 2007. Mr.
    Khoshbu’i’s name is also mentioned in the addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Moreover,
    this execution was announced by the communiqué of the Central
    Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office and published in the Kayhan newspaper on
    September 20, 1981. The communiqué of the Prosecutor’s Office states:
    “Kill those who rise against you for it is their punishment… The
    Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office… which bears the heavy responsibility in
    protecting the regime that has risen from the blood of tens of thousands
    of martyrs and is supported by the vast majority of the heroic nation, has
    tried these godless barbarians and condemned fifty of them, whose crime
    has been proven to the court, and whose existence leads to nothing other
    than corruption and destruction, to death.” Mr. Sasan Khoshbu’i was one of
    the 8 children in his family and was a high school student. A few years
    prior to the 1979 Revolution, his family was politicized and some of the
    children in the family became sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO). Mr. Sasan Khoshbu’i was shot in street clashes
    probably in 1980. After some time, the Friday Imam of Jahrom called the
    Khoshbu’i family “anti-Revolutionary” and their house was attacked. In
    July/August 1981, state officials went to their house in Fasa and arrested
    the family members. Mr. Khoshbu’i’s brothers, Sirus and Gholam Ali were
    killed in street clashes with state officials. Gholam Ali’s wife, Ms. Azam
    Sayadi was executed in December 1982/January 1983. Mr. Sasan Khoshbu’i was
    in charge of the MKO high school activities in Jahrom, and after moving to
    Tehran, he was responsible for an operational team of the Organization.
    Arrest and detention The details Mr. Khoshbu’i’s arrest and detention are
    not known. He was arrested in early September 1981 in Tehran and taken to
    Evin prison. According to his brother, he was tortured at Evin. Trial
    There is no information regarding this trial. Charges The Kayhan newspaper
    announced the collective charge against Mr. Khoshbu’i and 80 other
    individuals as “anti-Islamic activities.” The charges brought up
    personally against Mr. Khoshbu’i are not known. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available concerning Mr. Khoshbu’i’s
    defense. Judgment According to the communiqué of the Central Prosecutor’s
    Office, Mr. Sasan Khoshbu’i and 49 other individuals were shot by a firing
    squad in Evin prison on September 19, 1981. His family read the news in
    the newspapers, while they were imprisoned in Adelabad prison (Fars
    province).
