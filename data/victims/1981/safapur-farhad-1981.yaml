    Mr. Safapur said his and his brother s efforts were their duty to Iran. A
    favored saying: Life is but faith and jihad. Information about Mr. Farhad
    Safapur has been drawn from an interview with his brother. The public
    relations unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office announced
    his execution along with his younger brother Majid and 51 other
    individuals. The Jomhuri Eslami newspaper published this announcement on
    September 30, 1981. Mr. Safapur is also one of the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) in 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Safapur was born in 1959 in
    Esfahan. He was a third year student of dentistry in Esfahan University.
    His brother remembers, Farhad played with me When I was a child, he sat me
    on his lap when he drove and he let me take control of the steering wheel
    Wherever I went, I proudly stated that he was my brother He was
    good-looking, warm, and friendly My friends and I loved him He was an
    athlete. He swam a lot. He also played soccer. Mr. Safapur prayed but he
    believed in an Islam totally different from the Islam that the Iranian
    authorities preached. Mr. Safapur was a sympathizer of the MKO and was
    active in the communicationdepartment. His parents were worried about his
    political activism. A few months prior to his brother Majid s arrest on
    June 20, 1981, his parents had banned them from bringing political
    publications to the house. Consequently, Farhad and Majid rented a room
    and moved out. Their parents continued their efforts to convince them to
    stop their activism. After Majid s arrest, they tried to persuade Farhad
    to go underground. According to the interviewee, At that time, his friends
    who were politically active were being arrested one by one. There were
    vast group arrests. State agents raided a house and arrested everybody
    there. The demonstration of June 20, 1981 took place in protest against
    the Parliament s impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic
    Republic s systematic policy of excluding the MKO from the country s
    political domain, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO
    leaders and his insistence for them to disarm. The MKO had, until then,
    supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function
    within the framework of the new political system. On June 20, the
    organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations, in which some of the
    demonstrators were armed, all over the country. These demonstrations,
    which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of
    demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that targeted not only
    the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized as
    official government policy the months-old state harassment and suppression
    of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Arrest and detention The Revolutionary Guards arrested
    Mr. Safapur in July or August of 1981. One day, his family members went to
    visit him in his rented room. Armed Revolutionary Guards opened the door.
    The Safapur family realized that Farhad had been arrested but the Guards
    did not inform them of the reasons for his arrest. Despite the family s
    visits to numerous state agencies, including police stations and
    Revolutionary Guards bases, they were unable to find Mr. Safapur s
    whereabouts. A friend of his, who was arrested and saw him in custody,
    told the Safapurs after his own release that Farhad tried to comfort him
    in detention. According to information available, he was beaten in
    custody. During his detention of about two months, he was held
    incommunicado. Trial According to the communiqu of the central prosecution
    office, Mr. Safapur was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Esfahan. The date of the trial is not known. His family was not informed
    of the trial. Charges The central prosecution office announced that Mr.
    Safapur and 52 others, including his brother Majid, were collectively
    charged with armed action against the Islamic Republic of Iran; terror;
    murder; attacking the Revolutionary Guards and Basij brothers; attacking
    the Basij dormitories; throwing Molotov cocktails and grenades in public
    places, [aiming at] cars and shops of the Revolutionary Guards, Basij, and
    the Hezbollahi [Party of God] people. There is no information regarding
    the specific charges brought against Mr. Safapur. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
