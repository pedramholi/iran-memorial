    The news about execution of Mr. Bokharai was announced by the public
    relations office of prosecution of the central branch of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court and was published in Kayhan newspaper on December 28,
    1981. The press release reads as follows: “In the name of God, kill them
    until there is no more discord [in Arabic in the text of the communiqué
    and translated in Farsi]. Muslim Umma of Iran, God’s promise to you is
    that those who are corrupt will face nothing but humiliation and misery,
    and those who are believers will face triumph. This unwritten truth is as
    visible and clear in the lives of our prophets as is the sun. Therefore,
    the Islamic Revolutionary Court, which is duly responsible for the
    annihilation of puppet conspirators and mercenaries, will fulfill its
    religious duty by implementing God’s laws and sentencing corruptors on
    earth for their hideous crimes.” Also, Mr. Bokhara’i is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published in 1985 by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Additional information
    about Mr. Bokhara’i was sent via an electronic form by a person informed
    about his case. According to this information, Mr. Bokhara’i, son of Ali
    Akbar, was born in Tehran in 1950. He began his political activities in
    high school after becoming familiar with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    Before the revolution, Mr. Bokhara’i had been arrested, imprisoned and
    tortured in several times. He was condemned to a life in prison but was
    released in 1979 along with other political prisoners. According to the
    information provided in the electronic form, after the revolution, he
    became a high ranking member of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and in
    charge of the medical aid of the organization. He was known among his
    friends and relatives for his sense of humor. Those who knew him still
    remember his kind green eyes and his innocent smile. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members’
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah’s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization’s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention According
    to the information sent by the electronic form, he was arrested in Tehran
    in 1981 and was tortured severely during his detention. A prisoner had
    witnessed him with broken bones chained to a water heater radiator in a
    hallway in Evin Prison. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Bokhara’i’s trial. Charges According to the press release of the public
    relations office of prosecution of the central branch of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court that was published in Kayhan newspaper on December 28,
    1981, Mr. Bokhara’i’s crimes are as follows: (1) being one of the main
    cadre of “Monafeqin” (“hypocrites”); (2) plundering and concealing weapons
    and ammunitions from the Muslim Treasury for the benefit of the above
    mentioned American grouplet; (3) being involved in the martyrdom of 72
    true disciples of Imam, including Rajai the martyr and BaaHonar the
    martyr, at the central office of the Islamic Republic party; (4) taking
    part in the escape of the central cadre of the terrorist and bloodthirsty
    Monafeqin from facing the Islamic justice; (5)deviating the youth to turn
    so that they ended up turning their back to Islam; (6) being a decision
    maker in the armed opposition to the Islamic Regime; (7) serious attempt
    to overthrow the Islamic Regime of Ira
