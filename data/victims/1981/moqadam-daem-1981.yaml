    News of the execution of Mr. Da’em Moqadam, along with another person, was
    published in the Kayhan newspaper on October 7, 1981. Arrest and detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial
    took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Da’em Moqadam were announced as, “destruction training
    in Iraq, spying for Iraq, frequent trips to Iraq, supplying illegal
    weapons and ammunition for terrorism inside the country, and armed
    uprising against the Islamic Republic of Iran.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Da’em Moqadam's defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz condemned Mr. Da’em Moqadam to death. The
    ruling was carried out in Ahvaz on October 6, 1981. No specific
    information is available about the defendant’s execution.
