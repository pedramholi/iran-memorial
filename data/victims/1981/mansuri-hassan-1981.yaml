    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan Mansuri, and his will, was also
    published in the book "Az Armani ke Mijushad" by the sympathizers of the
    Peykar Organization in August of 1985. He was a sympathizer of Peykar in
    Orumieh and was active in the Student Organization of Peykar. His will is
    dated August 9, 1981. Mr. Hassan Mansuri is one of the 430 individuals
    whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh
    va Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the
    organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the
    individuals on this list have been executed. Mr. Hassan Mansuri is one of
    the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985.
    The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups,
    who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic
    security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Hassan
    Mansuri's charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hassan Mansuri's
    defense. Judgment According to the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization, Mr. Hassan Mansuri was executed by firing squad in Tabriz on
    August 10, 1981. No specific information is available about the
    defendant’s execution.
