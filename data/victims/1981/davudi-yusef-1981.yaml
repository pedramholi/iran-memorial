    News of the execution of Mr. Yusef Davudi was published in the Kayhan
    newspaper on July 30, 1981. Mr. Yusef Davudi is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According
    to the report, Mr. Yusef Davudi was a high school student. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest

    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges No information is available on the defendant s charges. Evidence

    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Behbahan identified Mr. Yusef Davudi as
    "Mohareb (fighter), Baghi (rebel), and Mortad (apostate)." He was
    condemned to death. The ruling was carried out when he was executed in the
    Ramhormoz on July 28, 1981 at 4:30 am. He was 17 years old.
