    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organizatio who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    theSoviet Unionas a "Social imperialist" state, believed thatChinahad
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime ofIran. The brutal repression of dissidents
    by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982
    effectivelydismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By
    the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
