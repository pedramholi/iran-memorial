    The news of the execution of Mr. Hassan Chegini was announced by a report
    published in Ettela at on July 5, 1981 as well as a Karaj Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office communiqu published in Kayhan on July 6,
    1981. Mr. Chegini, 20, and a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded
    in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Chegini s arrest and detention are not known. Trial According to
    the Karaj Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office communiqu , the Karaj
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal issued Mr. Chegini s sentence. No
    information is available on the Mr. Chegini s trial. Charges According to
    the Karaj Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office communiqu , Mr.
    Chegini was charged with A:Participating in and leading all
    demonstrations, B: Assault and Battery with cold weapons, resulting in
    injury and hospitalization of Muslims, C: Causing clashes and inducing
    panic in Karaj s Hesar region, D: Declaring Hesar a free region and
    involvement in blocking Revolutionary Guards, E: Identifying and
    threatening Muslims, F: Insulting government officials along with
    accomplices using loudspeakers, G: Fleeing the authorities repeatedly.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Chegini. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Chegini s defense. Judgment The Karaj
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal found Mr. Chegini guilty of corruption on
    earth and waging war On God and God s Prophet, and sentenced him to death.
    The communiqu from the Karaj Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office
    stated that Mr. Chegini was executed, but it did not provide a date for
    his execution. The addendum to the Mojahed magazine, however, indicates
    that Mr. Chegini died under torture on July 4, 1981. Mr. Chegini was 20
    years old at the time of his execution. *The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested
