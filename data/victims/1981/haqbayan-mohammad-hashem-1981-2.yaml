    The information about Mr. Mohammad Hashem Haqbayan, son of Ramezan Ali,
    was sent to Omid via an electronic form by an individual close to him. His
    execution along with his brother Ali Akbar, was announced in the Kayhan
    and Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on August 12, 1981. Mr. Haqbayan is also one
    of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on
    the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of more
    than 400 individuals executed after the 1979 revolution. Additionally, his
    name appears among the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The addendum lists individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Mr. Haqbayan was born in 1954 in Amirabad village in
    northern province of Mazandaran. He received his bachelor’s degree in
    accounting from Mazandaran University in Babolsar. As a student, he began
    his political activities and worked for the amelioration of workers’
    rights and their living conditions. He was a member of the Paykar
    organization. In addition to reading Peykar publication, he worked in rice
    farms and taught at schools as a volunteer. The person familiar with this
    case remembers Mr. Haqbayan as a “calm man who believed in the principles
    of the Peykar organization… When hearing criticism of the organization, he
    defended Peykar and enthusiastically cooperated with the publishing
    section of Peykar.” Once, when participating in a demonstration in Amol
    (another city in Mazandaran province), the revolutionary guards attacked
    the protestors. Shrapnel from a grenade hit Mr. Haybayan’s leg and he was
    taken to a hospital. With the help of his brother and a nurse, he escaped
    from the hospital before being arrested. The person close to Mr. Haqbayan
    conveyed this memory about him. “Once Hashem borrowed a motorcycle from
    his friends, but he did not know how to ride in properly. One night, his
    brother Akbar asked him if he could take Akbar on the motorcycle to
    another village. Hashem accepted but since he lacked the skill to ride the
    motorcycle, they had an accident and they both fell into a stream and it
    took them several hours to get themselves out of the stream and into a
    safe place.” The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention Based on the available information, at 7
    p.m. on June 26, 1981, the revolutionary guards of Nur (city in
    Mazandaran) surrounded Amirabad and arrested Mr. Haqbayan and his brother
    without a warrant and took them to Nur. Their family members went to the
    revolutionary guards headquarters in Nur to visit them, but they were not
    allowed to see their sons. The Haybayan brothers were held incommunicado
    the entire time. Trial On July 8, 1982, Mr. Haqbayan was tried at Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Nur. Charges The collective charges against Mr.
    Haqbayan and his brother were announced in the newspaper as “supporting
    the Peykar Organization, continuous activity and participation in
    confrontations in Amol, Qa’emshahr, and Gonbad, propaganda for those
    groups that were active in the incidents in Gonbad and Kordestan,
    misleading youngsters, and animosity against the Islamic Republic based on
    deception and wrong doing.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt At the time of arrest, the
    revolutionary guards searched the Haqbayans’ house and found some
    publications of the Peykar organization. These were used as evidence to
    prove guilt. Defense No information is available on Mr. Haqbayan’s
    defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Nur called Mr.
    Mohammad Hashem Haqbayan as “an apostate, a corruptor on earth and an
    enemy of God” and condemned him to death. The sender of the electronic
    form has found contrary information years after the executions. This
