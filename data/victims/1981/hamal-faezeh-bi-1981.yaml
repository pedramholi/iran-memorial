    The news of the execution of Ms. Faezeh Bi Hamal was announced in a report
    published in Kayhan on July 22, 1981. Ms. Bi Hamal is also one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. She is also one of the
    1533 executed prisoners listed by the Association of Iranian Women of K ln
    (Germany). The list published in 1997 is entitled: "A partial list of
    names of women executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran." The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted
    the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention Based on
    the available information, Ms. Bi Hamal was arrested in Babolsar. No
    detailed information is available on her arrest and detention. Trial The
    report in Kayhan does not specify the exact location of Ms. Bi Hamal s
    trial, but it indicates that her sentence was issued by either the Sari or
    Amol Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal. No detailed information is available
    on Ms. Bi Hamal s trial. Charges According to the report published in
    Kayhan Ms. Bi Hamal was charged with throwing a Molotov cocktail at the
    Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation s automobile in Babolsar, and attacking
    female body inspectors with a knife during inspection. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Ms. Bi Hamal. Defense No information is
    available on Ms. Bi Hamal s defense. Judgment According to the report in
    Kayhan , either the Sari or the Amol Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal found
    Ms. Bi Hamal guilty of waging war on God, rebellion, and corruption on
    earth, and sentenced her to death. Ms. Bi Hamal was executed by a firing
    squad on July 21, 1981. According to Kayhan Ms. Bi Hamal was executed in
    either Sari or Amol. The addendum to the Mojahed magazine (issue 261),
    however, states that Ms. Bi Hamal was executed in Babol. Ms. Bi Hamal was
    17 years old at the time of her execution.
    ------------------------------------------------------ *The exclusion of
    MKO members from government offices and the closure of their centers and
    publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities
    different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two.
    Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and
    the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin
    sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while distributing
    publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20,
    1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by
    governmental officials and the government officials efforts to impeach
    their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the
    regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets,
    some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The
    number of casualties that resulted from this demonstration is unknown but
    a large number of demonstrators were arrested and executed in the
    following days and weeks. The day after the demonstration, the Islamic
    Republic regime started a repressive campaign unprecedented in modern
    Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and sympathizers were arrested
    or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO announced an armed strug
