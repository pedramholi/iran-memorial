    The news of the execution of Mr. Ali Akbar Montazeri (Montazeri Juybari)

    theoretical leaders of Mojahedin Khalq supporters, involvement in clashes
    in Juybar, near Qa’em Shahr, which resulted in injury to tens of

    Khalq Organization.” Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does

    Judgment The Qa’em Shahr Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal found Mr.

    corruption on earth, and sentenced him to death. The Supreme Judicial
    Council upheld this sentence. Mr. Montazeri was executed by a firing squad
    on July 7, 1981 near the Shirgah-Qa’em Shahr road. Mr. Montazeri was 29
    years old at the time of his execution. _________________________ *The
    exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of their
    centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic
    authorities’ different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between
    the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as
    “Hypocrites” and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
    treatment by governmental officials and the government officials’ efforts
    to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact
    that the regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and
    Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from this
    demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were arrested
    and executed in the following days and weeks. The day after the
    demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a repressive campaign –
    unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and
    sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO
    announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and assassinated
    a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the Islamic regime.
    In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the impeached President
    (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they founded the National
    Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many of its members were
    expelled from France, they went to Iraq and founded the National
    Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which entered Iranian territory a few
    times during the Iran-Iraq war. They were defeated in July 1988 during
    their last operation, the Forugh Javidan Operation. A few days after this
    operation, thousands of imprisoned Mojahedin supporters were killed during
    the mass executions of political prisoners in 1988. Ever since the summer
    of 1981, the MKO has continued its activities outside of Iran. No
    information is available regarding members and activities of the MKO
    inside the country. In spite of the “armed struggle” announcement by the
    MKO on June 20, 1981, many sympathizers of the organization had no
    military training, were not armed, and did not participate in armed
    conflict.
