    The news of Mr. Esfandiar Kamran s execution was announced in a communiqu
    by the Behshahr Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office published in
    Jomhouri Eslami newspaper on August 6, 1981. Mr. Esfandiar Kamran, 19,
    industrial worker, and a Mojahedin Khalq sympathizer is also one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Kamran s arrest and detention are not known. Trial A
    Behshahr Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office communiqu published in
    Ettela at on July 16, 1981 announced that the trial for Mr. Kamran and
    three other defendants will be held on that date. No other information is
    available on Mr. Kamran s trial Charges The Behshahr Public Prosecutor s
    Office communiqu lists the charges leveled against Mr. Kamran and two
    other defendants as follows: Actively opposing the Islamic Revolution in a
    leadership position in support of the Hypocrites Organization, which has
    declared an armed struggle and rebelled against the Islamic Republic,
    terrorized [the public] through repeated street clashes, and caused injury
    to several people. The Behshahr Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office
    communiqu did not mention any charges specific to Mr. Kamran and did not
    provide any information on the date and location of the above mentioned
    clashes. Evidence of guilt A Behshahr Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s
    Office communiqu published in Ettela at on July 16, 1981 asked potential
    plaintiffs and witnesses to present the information they have on Mr.
    Kamran and three other defendants to the Behshahr Islamic Revolutionary
    Guards Corps. The report of this execution, however, does not include any
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Kamran Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Kamran s defense. Judgment The Behshahr
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal found Mr. Kamran guilty of waging war
    against God, rebellion against the Islamic government and corruption on
    earth, and sentenced Mr. Kamran to death. Mr. Kamran was executed by a
    firing squad on August 4, 1981. Mr. Kamran was 19 years old at the time of
    his execution. _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members
    from government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing
    houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arres
