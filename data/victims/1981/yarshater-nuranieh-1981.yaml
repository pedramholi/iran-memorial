    Information regarding the extrajudicial execution of Ms. Nuranieh (Nura)
    Yarshater (also spelled " Nuraniyyih Yarshatir") daughter of Rohanieh and
    Hashem, was collected from Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran website
    (June 24, 2020), Katayun Taqizadeh on Facebook (February 22, 2021), Kayhan
    Newspaper, London (August 26, 2018), Ehsan Yarshater Wikipedia, and
    memories of Ms. Mah Mehr Golestaneh and Dr. Cyrus Towfiq about Ms.
    Yarshater. Ms. Yarshater was 59. She was born in Hamedan, into a Baha i
    family originally from Kashan. Her father was a merchant and her mother,
    Rohanieh Misaqieh, was known as a progressive woman. Ms. Yarshater had
    three brothers. One of her brothers is Mr. Ehsan Yarshater who was
    interested in Persian language and literature. He edited the Encyclopaedia
    Iranica and founded the Center for Iranian Studies, among other
    activities. According to available information, Ms. Yarshater lost her
    parents in childhood. She and her younger brother went to live with their
    grandmother, Ms. Jahan Misaqieh. Ms. Yarshater attended Tarbiat (Baha i)
    School in Tehran. In her youth she married Mr. Ruhollah Motevajeh, but
    they eventually separated. She had two sons from that marriage. She knew
    English and worked at the Book Translation and Publishing Company of the
    Pahlavi Foundation. Being a Baha i, Ms. Yarshater did not have a
    comfortable life in Iran. She was persecuted and harassed because of her
    adherence to the Baha i Faith. She was often verbally assaulted by
    prejudiced neighbors, and her car was twice deliberately rammed. (Archives
    of Baha i Persecution in Iran) The Baha i International Community
    published a report in 1999, entitled Iran s secret blueprint for the
    destruction of the Baha i community . This report catalogues the
    persecution of Baha is in Iran and lists the Baha is who had been killed
    since 1978. Ms. Nuranieh Yarshater is one of 206 people listed in this
    report. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background
    Authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran (the largest minority, with
    approximately three hundred thousand members) to systematic harassment and
    persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The
    Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic
    Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result,
    the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status of a
    religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith and are
    banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice
    has subjected them to abuse and violence. * They have been banned from any
    activities in the public realm, and their political, social, and economic
    rights are constantly violated. Baha is are deprived of the right to
    education, particularly higher education, and are banned from holding jobs
    in the government or in government-affiliated entities. They are not even
    safe and secure in owning private businesses, and in many cases, their
    places of business have either been attacked by individuals and groups
    affiliated with the government or are shut down for refusing to work on
    religious holy days. The Iranian regime arrests Baha is on trumped up
    charges on a regular basis. [3] Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not
    specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that
    it was amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself,
    supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and
    in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from
    France to Iran, in response to a question regarding political and
    religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government,
    Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they are harmful
    and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked
    another question: Will they be free to perform their religious rites? The
    Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i
    threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national security
    in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Ms. Yarshter s Death
    On February 10, 1981, Ms. Yarshater was murdered in her home in Tehran by
    person or persons unknown. Her wrist and throat had been slit with a
    kitchen knife. According to available information, Ms. Yarshater s brother
    found her body a few days after she was killed. Ms. Yarshater had been
    home alone at the time of the murder. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in
    Iran) The London Edition of Kayhan Newspaper attributed the extrajudicial
    execution of Ms. Yarshater to her brother s activities: Ever since the
    early day, the Islamic Republic opposed Dr. Yarshater and his activities
    in safeguarding Persian culture and language. Dr. Yarshater was known to
    be a Baha i and he worked for the preservation of Persian culture and
    language. Both of these attributes were in complete opposition to the
    goals
