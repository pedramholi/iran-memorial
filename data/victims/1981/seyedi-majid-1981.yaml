    Information about Mr. Majid Seyed, son of Mohammad, has been sent to Omid
    by a friend via an electronic form. This execution was also reported in
    the Kayhan newspaper on December 29, 1981, and in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    1985. This addendum lists 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. The newspapers report calls Mr. Seyedi and his co-defendant
    two of the leaders of the apostate group-let of Fadaiyan Minority in
    Karaj. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired
    by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America,
    was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and
    was active mainly in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest
    and detention The details of Mr. Seyedi s arrest and detention are not
    known, except that he was arrested in September/October 1981 in Karaj.
    According to the sender of the form, during his detention he was held
    incommunicado. Trial There is no information regarding this trial, other
    than Mr. Seyedi was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Karaj.
    Charges The newspaper announces the charges against Mr. Seyedi and his
    co-defendant as three counts of armed robbery, carrying arms, distribution
    of the Organization s publications, and plotting against the regime of the
    Islamic Republic. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense No
    information is available concerning Mr. Seyedi s defense, other than he
    was denied the right to have an attorney. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Karaj called Mr. Seyedi an enemy of God and
    condemned him to death. According to the newspaper, Mr. Majid Seyedi was
    shot by a firing squad in Karaj on December 28, 1981 at dawn.
