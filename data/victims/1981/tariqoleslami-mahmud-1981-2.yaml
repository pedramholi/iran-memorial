    Mr. Mahmud Tariqoleslami is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The following information about Mr.
    Mahmud Tariqoleslami is taken from the book Our Martyrs for Freedom and
    Socialism by Rah-e Kargar Publications. He was born into a religious
    family in Esfahan in 1948. As a student of Tehran University, he was a
    follower of Ayatollah Khomeini. Then, he joined the MKO and left the
    university. He became a worker in Esfahan. He participated in the armed
    guerrilla movement against the previous regime. In 1975, he was arrested.
    At first he was condemned to death, but later his punishment was reduced
    to life imprisonment. In prison, he became a Marxist-Leninist sympathizer;
    and after his release in 1978, he joined the Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran, Rah-e Kargar. He was in charge of the Esfahan
    Committee of the Organization. According to the above book, his family and
    friends were very angry about his atheist beliefs and his opposition to
    the Islamic Republic. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They
    identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention
