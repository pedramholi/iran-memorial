    The news about execution of Ms. Afsaneh Razmju was announced by a press
    release by the public relations office of the prosecutor general of
    central branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Court and was published in
    Kayhan newspaper on September 30, 1981. The press release, which announced
    the execution of 43 anti-revolutionaries including Ms. Razmju, read as
    follows: The Muslim warrior Umma relies on Allah and the ultimate vote of
    revolutionary Iranians [to neutralize] the constant plots of the enemies
    of Islam and the Quran to overthrow the regime of the Islamic Republic.
    The blind-hearted leech-like [enemies] that cause riot and disturbance in
    the streets do so to throw you, the ever-present Umma , out of the
    battlefield of the struggle against the global imperialism. Ms. Razmju is
    one of the 1,533 executed prisoners listed by the Association of Iranian
    Women of K ln (Germany). The list published in 1997 is entitled: "A
    partial list of names of women executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran."
    Moreover, Ms. Razmju is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published in 1985 by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The list includes individuals, affiliated
    with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes
    with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the
    publication date of the magazine. Moreover, Keyhan newspaper published the
    news about his execution on December 28, 1981. Additional information
    about Ms. Razmju was sent via two electronic forms by persons informed
    about this case. Ms. Razmju, daughter of Ardeshir, was born in 1965. She
    was an eleventh grade student in Elham high school in Tehran and a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. She was 16 years old at
    the time of her execution. International laws strictly prohibit capital
    punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of 18. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention According to one electronic form, Ms.
    Razmju was arrested at Kharazmi high school in Tehran. Trial Mr. Razmju,
    along with 42 other individuals, were tried by the central branch of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court and sentenced to death ( Keyhan newspaper).
    Charges According on the above-mentioned press release, Mr. Razmju, along
    with four other individuals, was charged with the following crimes: being
    active members of the anti-people s Monafeqin organization; carrying
    grenades with the intent to throw at people; participating in armed
    demonstrations; identifying the members of Hezbollah and other important
    persons; being present at the safe houses; providing considerable
    financial assistance to the Organization; being members of the operating
    teams and providing oil bottles and turpentine for making Molotov
    cocktails; providing forged license plates for automobiles in order to
    carryout coward acts of assassination; participating in terrorist
    activities; setting ablaze different vicinities; and acting against the
    Islamic Republic. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this accused cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees
    of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide a
