    The execution of Mr. Lefteh Bojshadi, son of Abdossadeh, and 4 other
    individuals was announced in the Kayhan and the Jomhuri Eslami newspapers
    on October 8, 1981. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial other than he was tried at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz. Charges Mr. Bojshadi was charged with
    adultery . The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution refers to his
    explicit confession . International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on his defense. Judgment In accordance with
    the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz, Mr. Lefteh Bojshodi was
    executed on October 6, 1981 at dawn.
