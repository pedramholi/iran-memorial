    The information about Asghar Laqa i was taken from an interview with a
    family friend. Mr. Laqahi is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in
    an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Mr. Laqa i was born in Tehran. He was married and
    had two sons: the younger one was born after his execution. He worked at
    the Tehran s bazaar. He was a nationalist and member of the Iran Nation
    Party. The Iran Nation Party was founded in 1951 as the result of a split
    from the Pan Iranist Party. The nationalist Iran Nation Party endorsed Dr.
    Mohammad Mossadeq s policies and actively resisted the coup of August 18,
    1953, which overthrew the Mossadeq government. The Iran Nation Party
    excluded Pan Iranism from its ideology in 1961. The Iran Nation Party
    joined the National Front, which was led by Dr. Shapur Bakhtiar, Dariush
    Foruhar, and Dr. Karim Sanjabi. The Party remained a member of this
    coalition until the Revolution. In 1979, the Iran Nation Party joined the
    Islamic Revolution forces and accepted the leadership of Ayatollah
    Khomeini. In June 1981, when the Iranian government intensified its
    oppression of political opposition and banned political parties, the Iran
    Nation Party limited its activities. The relative political opening that
    followed the presidential election of May 23, 1996, encouraged the Iran
    Nation Party to resume its activities unofficially, in particular among
    students. Arrest and detention Mr. Laqa i was arrested in Tehran in 1981.
    No further information is available. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Laqa i was reportedly charged with
    giving refuge to the impeached president, Bani Sadr. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Laqa i s defense. Judgment Mr. Laqa i was sentenced to
    death and executed in 1981 in Evin prison.
