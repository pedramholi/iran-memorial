    organizations have committed a crime unprecedented in history. These vile
    mercenaries, under the guise of People's Mojahedin, People’s Fadaiyan of
    Iran, and Peykar, and in connivance with the enemy of this country and
    following the ominous plans of the world-domineering America, have engaged
    in an armed rebellion against the Islamic Republic..." This execution was
    also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published
    by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes 12028
