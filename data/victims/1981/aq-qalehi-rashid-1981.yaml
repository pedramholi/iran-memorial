    News of the execution of Mr. Rashid Aq-Qal ehi, son of Gholam, along with
    twenty-two others, was published in the Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami
    newspapers on July 19, 1981, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office of the Islamic Republic.
    Arrest and detention According to the announcement by the Public Relations
    Office of the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office of the Islamic
    Republic, Mr. Rashid Aq-Qal ehi, along with eighty-nine others, was
    arrested by the Revolutionary Guards in Hezardastgah Naziabad Golabdareh
    on June 17, 1981. The Revolutionary Guards had surrounded the building.
    Mr. Rashid Aq-Qal ehi was detained and interrogated for eighteen days.
    Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran tried these defendants.
    The trial sessions continued in various branches of the Revolutionary
    Courts until July 5, 1981. Charges The charges against Mr. Rashid Aq-Qal
    ehi, along with fourteen others, were collectively announced as, being
    main coordinators, trainers, and directors of the team house, supplying
    weapons, sending other defendants to the streets and public places after
    being trained for using weapons, and personally fighting with weapons. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt According to the above report, the evidence presented
    against the defendants was as follows: During the search of the mentioned
    team house, many weaponries were recovered such as G3 machineguns, Molotov
    cocktails, containers of incendiary materials, bullets for Colt, Uzi, and
    G3 weapons, bows and arrows, slings, knives, carpet cutters, homemade
    grenades, bags of salt and pepper, pieces of stone and brick, gallows
    ropes, and other tools such as spray paint, caskets, net caps, canteens,
    back packs, cameras, radios, calculators, overcoats, fabric bags, and many
    books and tapes and documents and publications of Monafeqin [Mojahedin
    Khalq] which were partially burned by them. The confessions of the
    defendants and testimonies of the Revolutionary Guards who discovered the
    team house were also presented as evidence. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions, during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense According to the announcement, the defendant defended
    himself after understanding the charges. The Prosecution s communiqu does
    not provide specific information on Mr. Rashid Aq-Qal ehi's defense.
    Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran identified Mr. Rashid
    Aq-Qal ehi as "Mofsed (corruptor on Earth), Mohareb [a person who wages
    war against God], Baghi (rebel), and for armed uprising against the rule
    of the Islamic Republic." He was condemned to death. The ruling was
    carried out when he was executed by firing squad in the Evin prison yard
    on July 5, 1981 at night. No specific information is available about the
    defendant s execution.
