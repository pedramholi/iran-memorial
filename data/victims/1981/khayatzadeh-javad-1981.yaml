    News of the execution of Mr. Javad Khayatzadeh, known as Yashar, along
    with eighteen others, was published in the Keyhan newspaper on August 3,
    1981. The Public Relations Department of the Revolutionary and Public
    Prosecutor’s Office in Tabriz issued an announcement about these
    executions, the defendants' names, and their charges. Mr. Khayatzadeh is
    also one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs
    of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class”
    published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the
    names of those members of the organization who died after the revolution
    of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed.
    Additionally, his name is mentioned in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6,
    1985, amongst the 12,028 individuals affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Mr. Khayatzadeh was active in the Logistic Section of the Peykar
    Organization in Tabriz. He was from Azarshahr, in East Azarbaijan province
    in north west of Iran. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz tried Mr. Khayatzadeh. No
    other information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    Public Relations Department of the Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office in
    Tabriz announced the collective charges against Mr. Khayatzadeh and 6
    others as “armed uprising against the Islamic Republic of Iran in
    connection with his membership and effective collaboration with the
    American group-let of Peykar, which is at war with God, using the
    organizational safe houses for publication of newspapers, posters, and
    placards for Peykar and Komaleh group-lets, deluding the pure minds of
    uninformed youth, and cooperation with anti-Islam and anti-Quran armed
    groups of Komaleh, Fadaiyan Khalq (Ashraf Fraction), and others.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Khayatzadeh’s defense. Judgment َThe
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz identified Mr. Khayatzadeh “at war
    with God, His Prophet and the Twelfth Imam, a revel against the Islamic
    regime, corruptor on earth, and apostate.” He was condemned to death. The
    ruling was carried out and he was executed by a firing squad in the Tabriz
    prison yard on July 29, 1981 at 11 pm.
