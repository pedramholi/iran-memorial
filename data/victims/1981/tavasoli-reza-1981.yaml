    News of the execution of Mr. Reza Tavasoli, son of Morteza, along with
    eleven others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on August 9, 1981.
    The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz issued an announcement
    concerning these executions, the defendants' names, and their charges, and
    released it to the media. Mr. Reza Tavasoli is one of the 430 individuals
    whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh
    va Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the
    organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the
    individuals on this list have been executed. Mr. Reza Tavasoli is one of
    the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985.
    The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups,
    who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic
    security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Mr. Reza Tavasoli was tried in
    the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz. No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz
    announced the charges against Mr. Reza Tavasoli as, armed uprising against
    the Islam and the Islamic Revolution of Iran in connection to the American
    fighter and illegal armed group of Peykar, distribution and publishing
    publications of this organization, and misleading the minds of ignorant
    young. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Reza Tavasoli's defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz idendified Mr. Reza Tavasoli as,
    Mohareb (fighter) against God, the Prophet, the Occult Imam, and his
    rightful representative, Mortad (apostate), and Baghi (reble). He was
    condemned to death. The ruling was carried out in the Tabriz prison yard
    on August 7, 1981 at night. No specific information is available about the
    defendant s execution.
