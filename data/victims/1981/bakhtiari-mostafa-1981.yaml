    News of the execution of Mr. Mostafa Bakhtiari, along with three others,
    was published in the Kayhan newspaper on October 28, 1981. Detailed
    information about these defendants and their charges were stated in an
    announcement by the News Unit of the Revolutionary Guards of Mahabad. Mr.
    Mostafa Bakhtiari is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the
    list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Mr. Mostafa Bakhtiari is one of the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of
    dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. According to
    the Kayhan report, the defendant was tried by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Mahabad. Charges The charges against Mr. Mostafa Bakhtiari were
    announced as, "participation in eleven armed conflicts and the killing of
    several people, including brothers from the Army and Revolutionary Guards,
    and defenseless people." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. The report only refers to the confessions of the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Mostafa Bakhtiari's defense.

    in the afternoon. No specific information is available about this
