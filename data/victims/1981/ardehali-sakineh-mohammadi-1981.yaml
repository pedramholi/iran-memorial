    The information about Ms. Sakineh Mohammadi Ardehali, daughter of Hossein,
    was sent to Omid by a person familiar with this case via an electronic
    form. This execution was also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) in
    1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Additional information was taken from the MKO website, and
    an article by Mr. Iraj Mesdaghi, posted on the Bidaran website on December
    8, 2008. Ms. Mohammadi Ardehali was born in 1922 in Arak. She was a
    sympathizer of the MKO. She had an elementary school education. She was
    active in the Muslim Mothers Association and managed the women s religious
    sessions in Tehran. She also participated in demonstrations against the
    Islamic Republic regime and was arrested once before the June 20, 1981
    demonstration, and was released a month later. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention Based on
    information available, Mr. Mohammadi Ardehali was arrested in her house in
    Mashad, along with her husband and daughter in June of 1981. She was
    transferred to Evin prison in Tehran. She was denied visits with her
    family members although 6 of her children and her husband were all in
    prison. According to the MKO website, she was tortured severely both
    physically and psychologically for seven months in Evin prison. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The person
    close to her states that she insulted the prison authorities who tortured
    her and her children. This person believes this was a charge against Ms.
    Mohammadi Ardehali. No further information is available on Ms. Mohammadi
    Ardehali s official charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense She was denied the right to have an
    attorney. Mr. Mesdaghi states that she was executed only because she
    opposed the death penalty and torture, and also because she defended her
    children who opposed the Iranian regime. Judgment According to the MKO
    website, Ms. Mohammadi Ardehali was executed by a firing squad in Evin
    prison on December 30, 1981. _________________________ * The Mojahedin
