    Reference to the execution of Mr. Kamran Samimi, a linguist, and seven
    other members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha is in Iran,
    was made by the President of the Central Revolutionary Court in an
    interview in Kayhan number 11488 published on 20 January 1982 (30 Day
    1360). Mr. Samimi is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999
    report published by the Baha i International Community. In addition, a
    report, The Persecution of the Baha i Community of Iran , in The Baha i
    World, Volume XIX, documents the persecution of the members of the Faith
    in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978.
    More information has been drawn from other volumes of the The Baha i World
    , A Tribute to the Faithful by Mah Mehr Gulistanih, The Baha i Question:
    Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community as
    well as other documents provided by the Baha i International Community.
    Mr. Samimi was the founder of a center for the study of foreign languages
    in Tehran prior to his move to Indonesia in 1953, where he helped to
    strengthen the Baha i community and institutions through his membership on
    the Southeast Asian Regional Assembly. Upon his return to Iran in 1972,
    Mr. Samimi was elected to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tehran and later
    the National Spiritual Assembly of Baha is in Iran. The Baha is in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Baha i National Spiritual Assembly After the
    Islamic Revolution In the organizational structure of the Baha i
    community, the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly is a body
    composed of nine individuals that are elected annually with the votes of
    adult Baha is in each country. This institution tends to the affairs and
    issues of the Baha i community on the national level. The National
    Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of guiding, coordinating, and
    moving forward the activities of each country s local spiritual
    assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl ( House of Justice
    ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the highest
    decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I s
    Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual
    assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz,
    were severely persecuted and the majority of their members were executed.
    In The Final Message of the Iran National Spiritual Assembly to the
    Friends of the Country , the Third Baha i National Spiritual Assembly,
    abiding by the principle of obeying the government, announced the closure
    of the Baha i organizations, and at the same time, sent an open letter to
    two thousand well-known and high-ranking government figures asking an end
    to the arrest, detention, torture, execution, and injustice against Baha
    is. (BBC Persian website, October 11, 2015). Judicial officials of the
    Islamic Republic have come up with [unreasonable and unacceptable]
    justifications for the persecution and the execution of the members of the
    National Spiritual Assemblies. In a speech on May 28, 1982, Ayatollah
    Khomeini said: The Baha is are not a religion, they re a [political]
    party; it s a party that was supported by Britain in the pas
