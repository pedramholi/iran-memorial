    News of the execution of Mr. Abolfazl Taslimi, son of Ali Akbar, and 7
    other individuals, was published in Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    Wedenesday, August 19, 1981, and in Kayhan newspaper on Thursday, August
    20, 1981. The text of the communiqué was provided to Pars News Agency by
    the Islamic Revolutionary General Prosecutor’s Office. Mr. Taslimi is also
    one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Ahmad
    Hafezi was also arrested in connection with this group but committed
    suicide prior to being interrogated. Based on the communiqué of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran Revolutionary Prosecutor General’s Office, the
    Qom Revolutionary Tribunal announced the names of Mr. Taslimi and seven
    others “who had been active and effective members and cronies of the
    Hypocrites’ (derogatory term used by the Islamic Republic to describe the
    MKO) Qom branch and had been arrested with the extremely effective
    cooperation of Qom’s Moslem, [vigilant], and ever present [in the
    political, social, and cultural arenas] population, and had been tried in
    the court of Islamic Justice and meted out divine punishment for their
    shameful and inhuman acts, in order to serve as a lesson in prudence and
    thinking [before taking action] to others.” Based on available
    information, Mr. Taslimi was 18 years old, single, a high school student,
    and a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members’
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah’s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization’s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention Based on
    the Islamic Republic of Iran Revolutionary Prosecutor General’s Office’s
    communiqué, Mr. Taslimi and 8 other individuals were arrested in the city
    of Qom. Details of the circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Based on available information, the Qom Revolutionary
    Court tried Mr. Taslimi and 7 other individuals. Charges According to the
    announcement of the Islamic Revolutionary General Prosecutor’s Office, Mr.
    Abolfazl Taslimi’s charges were stated as being “the person in charge of
    the Students Section, and intermediary with the girls affiliated with the
    Monafeqin Organization.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Taslimi’s defense.
    Judgment The Qom Islamic Revolutionary Court declared Mr. Abolfazl Taslimi
    and 7 other individuals “Mohareb with God and His Messenger” (“One who
    wages war with God and the Prophet Mohammad,”) and “Baqi against Islamic
    Rule” (“One who has turned against Islam and Islamic Rule”) and sentenced
    them to death. He was shot by a firing squad in Qom on Tuesday, August 18,
    1981. Mr. Taslimi was 18 years old. _________________________ *The
    exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of their

    authorities’ different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between
