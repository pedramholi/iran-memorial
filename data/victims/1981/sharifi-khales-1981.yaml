    The execution of Mr. Khales Sharifi, son of Majid, and three other
    individuals was announced in the Enqelab Eslami newspaper on January 8,
    1981. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Sharifi’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial There is no information regarding the
    trial, other than Mr. Sharif was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tabriz. Charges The collective charges against Mr. Sharifi and
    three other individuals were announced as the following: “smuggling and
    trade of narcotic drugs, debauchery, armed robberies, causing fear and
    fright among the population, and cooperation with illegal armed groups of
    Komaleh and Sanar Mamedi.” The personal charge against Mr. Sharifi is not
    known. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    No information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available concerning Sharifi’s defense.
    Judgment In accordance with the verdict of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tabriz, Mr. Khales Sharifi was executed in Tabriz.
