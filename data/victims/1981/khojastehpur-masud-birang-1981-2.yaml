    The information about Mr. Mas’ud Birang Khojastehpur has been drawn from
    an interview with a friend of his father. Mas’ud was a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He was a high school student and was a minor
    at the time of execution. His father, Mohammad Ali Birang Khojastehpur
    (also spelled Khojastehpour) was a wrestling champion, and winner of the
    bronze medal in Men’s Freestyle 52 kg wrestling in the 1956 Melbourne
    Summer Olympics. The latter was a respected sportsman and a friend of
    Gholam Reza Takhti, a wrestling champion. After his son’s execution, he
    lost his job and career; he passed away in 2007. Mr. Mas’ud Birang
    Khojastehpur was a studious scholar. He was sincere and humble. He
    refrained from wearing brand name sports jackets that his father brought
    from foreign countries, so that he would not appear to be flaunting
    himself. Arrest and detention Mr. Birang Khojastehpur was arrested in his
    father’s house in Tehran in the summer of 1981. He was first taken to the
    Committee of Tohid Circle in Tehran and then transferred to Evin prison.
    During his incommunicado detention in Evin, his family did not receive any
    information from him. Trial There is no information regarding this trial.
    Charges The charges brought against the defendant are not known. Evidence
    of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence presented
    against the accused. Defense No information is available concerning Mr.
    Birang Khojastehpur’s defense. Judgment Mr. Mas’ud Birang Khojastehpur was
    executed three or four days after arrest. No information is available on
    the verdict leading to his execution. His body and will were not returned
    to his family. He was buried at Behesht-e Zahra Cemetery. A few other high
    school students were executed at the same time and buried next to him. Mr.
    Mas’ud Birang Khojastehpur’s execution was announced in a newspaper. The
    source of this information, who was a journalist of the Ettala’at
    newspaper in 1981, states: “One day someone from the forensic team made a
    call to the sports department of the Ettela’at newspaper and said that a
    youth had been executed, whose father has the same name as the wrestling
    champion and coach of the national team, Mohammad Ali Khojastehpur. We
    immediately forwarded the news to his father. The news story was published
    the same or the following day.”
