    The news of Mr. Gholam Reza Akhlaqi’s execution was announced in two
    communiqués by the Karaj Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office
    published in Kayhan newspaper on July 11, 1981 and on July 16, 1981. Mr.
    Akhlaqi, 22, resident of Tankaman, and a member of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded
    in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members’ interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah’s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization’s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Akhlaqi’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial According to
    the Karaj Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office communiqué, the Karaj
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal issued Mr. Akhlaqi’s sentence. No detailed
    information is available on Mr. Akhlaqi’s trial. Charges According to the
    communiqué published in Kayhan on July 11, 1981 Mr. Akhlaqi was charged
    with “rebelling against the Islamic Republic,” “leading the assault on the
    Muslim and steadfast people of Tankaman with sticks and clubs” and
    “stoking fear and panic in the region.” The communiqué published on July
    16, 1981, however, announced his charges as follows: “A. Participating in
    clashes against the Islamic Republic. B. Attacking Muslims in a mosque and
    beating them with sticks and clubs. C. Insulting the authorities and
    attacking a mosque during a ceremony. D. Causing clashes resulting in
    extensive material loss and injuries. E. Attacking the homes of Muslims
    and members of the Islamic council.” Evidence of guilt The Karaj Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office communiqué, published in Kayhan on July
    11, 1981 mentioned “testimony of witnesses” against Mr. Akhlaqi and
    another defendant in court. It is not clear whether the testimonies were
    against Mr. Akhlaqi or the other defendant, and there is no information
    regarding the content of these testimonies. Defense According to the Karaj
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office communiqué published in Kayhan
    on July 16, 1981, the court heard the “defenses of the defendants” before
    issuing its verdict. No information, however, is available on Mr.
    Akhlaqi’s defense. Judgment The Karaj Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal found
    Mr. Gholam Reza Akhlaqi guilty of corruption on earth, war on God and
    God’s Prophet, and rebellion. Mr. Akhlaqi was sentenced to death, and he
    was executed by a firing squad on July 9, 1981 in Karaj. Mr. Akhlaqi was
    22 years old at the time of his execution. * *The exclusion of MKO members
    from government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing
    houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities’ different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as “Hypocrites” and the
    Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers
    regularly during demonstrations and while distributing publications,
    leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO
    called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental
    officials and the government officials’ efforts to impeach their ally,
    President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called
    this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets, som
