    The information about Mr. Mehdi Sami'i is taken from the book Our Martyrs
    for Freedom and Socialism by Rah-e Kargar Publications. He was born in
    Kangavar (in Kermanshah province), a graduate of the Tabriz Teacher s
    College, and a teacher employed by the Ministry of Education. In 1980, he
    was dismissed from work due to his political activities. He then taught
    welding in Labor Ministry in Hamadan. He was first a sympathizer of the
    Fedaiyan Khalq Organization and then he joined the Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran, Rah-e Kargar. After June 1981, he went underground.
    "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was
    established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They identified themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. The demonstration of June 20, 1981, took place in protest
    against the parliament's impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic
    Republic's systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) from politics, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO
    leaders and his insistence to disarm them. Until that day, the MKO had
    supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function
    within the framework of the new political system. On June 20, the
    Organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations all over the country. These
    demonstrations, which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing
    of dozens of demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and
    executions by the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that
    targeted all opposition groups. The massive repression, unprecedented in
    the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized the months-old state
    harassment and suppression of dissidents and resulted in the banning of
    all forms of independent political dissent. Arrest and detention Mr. Mehdi
    Sami'i was arrested accidentally by the Revolutionary Guards on
    Karimkhanzad Street in Tehran in August, 1981, and transferred to Evin
    Prison. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to the above source, the state radio announced his
    execution and introduced him as "a leader of the Fedaiyan Khalq
    Organization (Minority) who had a role in the Kurdistan killings." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available about
    his defence. Judgment No specific information is available about the death
    sentence. According to the above source, Mr. Mehdi Sami'i was executed by
    a firing squad at Evin Prison in September, 1981.
