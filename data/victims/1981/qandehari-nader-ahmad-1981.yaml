    The information about Mr. Nader Qandehari (with the pseudonym Ahmad) is
    taken from the book Our Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism by Rah-e Kargar
    Publications. He was born in Tehran and a high school graduate. After the
    revolution, he was active in the Association for Unemployed High School
    Graduates. He was a sympathizer of the Fedaiyan Khalq Organization. In
    1980, he joined the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran, Rah-e
    Kargar. Mr. Qandehari is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They
    identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention
    According to the above source, Mr. Nader Qandehari was arrested in front
    of his home on October 2 or 3, 1981. In the one week that he was detained
    before execution, his family was not informed of his whereabouts. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges No information
    is available on Mr. Nader Qandehari s charges. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in

    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available about his defense. Judgment
    No specific information is available about the execution sentence.
    According to the above source, Mr. Nader Qandehari was executed by a
    firing squad at Evin Prison on October 10, 1981. His family was not
    informed of his execution. After a long search, they found out that he was
    at Evin. They brought a toothbrush and towel to the prison and when they
    were told he had been executed. In his will, which was mostly crossed out
    by the officials, Mr. Qandehari wrote: "I worshiped life, mobility,
    friendship, and happiness. I hated death. But, since it is necessary
    today, there is no choice. I would die some day anyway."
