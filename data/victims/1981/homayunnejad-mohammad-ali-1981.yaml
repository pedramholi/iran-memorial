    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Homayunnejad, son of
    Karambakhsh, along with sixty-nine others, was published in the Kayhan
    newspaper on September 5, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the
    Central Public Prosecutor’s Office issued an announcement concerning these
    executions, the defendants' names, and their charges, and released it to
    the news agencies. News of the execution of Mr. Homayunnejad was also
    published in the Peykar publication, number 122, on October 12, 1981.
    Also, He is one of 430 “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va
    Peykar. Additionally his name is mentioned in the addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on
    September 6, 1985. The addendum lists 12,028 individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Mr. Homayunnejad was born in Zahedan in 1952. He was
    a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization and worked since 1979 in the
    coroner’s office in Esfahan. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to the Peykar publication, Mr. Homayunnejad was arrested on
    August 4, 1981. The details of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Homayunnejad were announced as being a “member of the
    legal committee of the American Organization of Peykar, organizing
    underground meetings, plotting against the Islamic Republic, and supplying
    and distributing leaflets and other publications of the Peykar.” These
    were collective charges brought against four Peykar sympathizers. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Homayunnejad’s defense. Judgment َThe
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran called Mr. Homayunnejad “an enemy of
    God, a corruptor on earth, and a rebel against the Islamic Regime” and the
    Court condemned him to death. He was shot by firing squad in Evin prison
    on September 1, 1981.
