    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad Reza Shafi zadeh, son of Mohammad,
    along with twenty-two others, was published in the Kayhan and Jomhuri
    Eslami newspapers on July 7, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the
    Central Public Prosecutor s Office issued an announcement concerning these
    executions, the defendants' names, and their charges, and released it to
    the news agencies. The Peykar magazine, number 122, published an article
    about Mr. Shafi zadeh on October 12, 1981. He is one of the 430
    individuals whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. Additionally, he is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Shafi
    zadeh was a founder of The Red Cell, a group of sympathizers of the Peykar
    organization in Kashan, and in charge of the Worker s Section and
    propaganda of this group. He participated in the workers struggle, and the
    nocturnal distribution of publications and writing slogans were some his
    activities. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention According to the Peykar publication, Mr.
    Shafi zadeh was first arrested in Kashan in 1980, and released later. He
    was arrested again in Kashan and spent a long time in prison without
    trail. Since he protested, resisted, and began a hunger strike in prison,
    the officials sent him to Evin prison in Tehran. They returned him to
    solitary confinement in Kashan after two months. No other information is
    available regarding the circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges The Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor s
    Office announced the charges against Mr. Shafi zadeh as, "active
    membership in the Communist Peykar Organization, having a record of
    several criminal activities, acting against the Islamic Republic,
    provoking the prisoners, rioting, creating disturbance, and apostasy. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Shafi zadeh s defense. Judgment َThe
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kashan identified Mr. Shafi zadeh as "a
    corruptor on earth), an enemy of God, and a rebel." He was condemned to
    death. According to the Peykar publication, Mr. Shafi zadeh, along with
    six others, was transferred from Kashan to Tehran on July 12, 1981, at
    night. Mr. Shafi zadeh was executed in Evin prison on July 5, 1981. The
    court considered Mr. him an apostate and therefore prevented the burial of
    his body in the Muslim cemetery. He was buried instead in the non-Muslim
    cemetery without a ceremony.
