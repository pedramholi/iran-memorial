    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad Zakeri (Zakeri Ahmad Abad) is based on
    two electronic forms sent to Omid by persons familiar with his case.
    According to this information, he was born in Takab in the Azarbaijan-e
    Gharbi Province in 1962. He was a high school graduate in math, single,
    and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to a split with the Marxist-Leninist section of the MKO in 1977.
    In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were
    released, along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize
    the MKO and to recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the
    1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO
    accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were primary in the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, whether by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic s
    leaders. * Arrest and detention According to one electronic form, Mr.
    Zakeri was arrested at Enqelab Street in Takab in September of 1981. He
    and his colleague were on their way home after work when a Revolutionary
    Guards vehicle stopped and a Guard ordered Mr. Zakeri to get in. He
    resisted and chanted slogans against the regime. Guards forced him into
    the car and took him away. According to another electronic form, Mr.
    Zakeri was detained and interrogated at Revolutionary Guards locations in
    Takab and Sanandaj. Trial No information is available on Mr. Zakeri s
    trial. According to one electronic form, he was tried in Sanandaj. There
    was no appeal court for him. Charges No information is available on Mr.
    Zakeri s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Zakeri.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Zakeri s defense. Judgment
    There is no information on the verdict leading to this execution. A court
    in Sanandaj condemned Mr. Ahmad Zakeri to death, and the ruling was
    carried out at Sanandaj Prison on October 9, 1981, in the morning.
    According to one electronic form, his family was informed of his execution
    and burial location one week later. They were not informed about his
    trial, nor his sentence. Mr. Zakeri was buried at the Behesht-e Mohammadi
    cemetery in Sanandaj. _________________________ * The exclusion of MKO
    members from government offices and the closure of their centers and
    publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities
    different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two.
    Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and
    the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin
    sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while distributing
    publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20,
    1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by
    governmental officials and the government officials efforts to impeach
    their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the
    regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets,
    some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The
    number of casualties that resulted from this demonstration is unknown but
    a large number of demonstrators were arrested and executed in the
    following days and weeks. The day after the demonstration, the Islamic
    Republic regime started a repressive campaign unprecedented in modern
    Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and sympathizers were arrested
    or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO announced an armed struggle against
    the Islamic Republic and assassinated a number of high-ranking officials
    and supporters of the Islamic regime. In the summer of 1981, the leader of
    the MKO and the impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in
    France, where they founded the National Council of Resistance. After the
    MKO leaders and many of its members were expelled fromFrance, they went
    toIraqand fou
