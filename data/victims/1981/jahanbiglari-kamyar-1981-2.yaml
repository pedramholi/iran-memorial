    The Public Relations Office of Evin Prison announced the execution of Mr.
    Kamyar Jahanbiglari, son of Ali Akbar, and 11 other individuals to the
    Pars news agency. The news was published in the Kayhan and the Johuri
    Eslami newspapers on August 5, 1981. Mr. Jahanbiglari is also one of the
    430 individuals whose name appears on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those members
    of the Organization who died after the Revolution of 1979. More than 400
    of the individuals on this list have been executed. Additional information
    has been drawn from the Peykar magazine (the main publication of the
    Peykar Organization), No. 122. This execution was also announced in the
    addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin
    Khalgh Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes 12,028
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According to the Peykar
    magazine, Mr. Jahanbiglari was born in Sanandaj (Kordestan province). He
    studied at Hadaf High School in Tehran. In 1971, he enrolled in the Fine
    Arts School of Tehran University, and after graduation he worked at Iran
    Valunu factory. In 1979 he started his political activities in the Peykar
    Organization and one year later was a candidate for its membership. Mr.
    Jahanbiglari was a husband and a father. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr.
    Jahanbiglari was charged with “armed rebellion” or “armed action against
    the Islamic Republic” according to Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami respectively.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on his defense. Judgment The Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Mr. Kamyar Jahanbiglari to death.
    According to the Mojahed magazine, he was on August 4, 1981. Kayhan and
    Jomhuri Eslami did not mention the exact date of execution but they
    published the story of the execution by a firing squad at Evin Prison on
    August 5.
