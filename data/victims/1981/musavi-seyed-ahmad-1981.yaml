    announced in the Kayhan and the Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on October 8,
    1981. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest

    Tribunal of Ahvaz. Charges Mr. Musavi was charged with “adultery,
    consumption of alcohol, illicit use of narcotic drugs, and causing the
    perversion of individuals”. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on his defense.

    Ahvaz, Mr. Seyed Ahmad Musavi was executed on October 6, 1981 at dawn.
