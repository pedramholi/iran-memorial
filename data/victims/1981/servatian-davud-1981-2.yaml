    News of the execution of Mr. Davud Servatian, son of Ahmad, along with
    eighteen others, was published in the Keyhan newspaper on August 3, 1981.
    The Public Relations Department of the Revolutionary Prosecution Office in
    Tabriz issued a statement about these executions. Mr. Servatian is one of
    the 430 “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. His death
    is also reported in the Peykar publication (No. 115, August 24, 1981).
    Moreover, his name appears among the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Davud Servatian was from
    Miandoab, a city in West Azarbaijan province in north-west of Iran. The
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by
    a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz tried Mr.
    Davud Servatian. No other information is available on the trial. Charges
    Mr. Servatian and six others were collectively charged with “armed
    uprising against the Islamic Republic of Iran in connection with his
    membership and effective cooperation with in the American group-let of
    Peykar which is at war with God, using the organization’s safe houses for
    all sorts of activities including publication of newspapers, posters, and
    placards for Peykar and Komaleh organizations, deluding the pure minds of
    unsuspecting youth, and cooperation with anti-Islam and anti-Koran armed
    groups of Komaleh, Fadaiyan Khalq (Ashraf Faction), and others.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Servatian’s defense. Judgment َThe
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz deemed Mr. Servatian to be “at war
    with God, His Prophet and the Twelfth Imam, a rebel against the Islamic
    regime, a corruptor on earth, and an apostate.” He was condemned to death
    and executed by a firing squad in Tabriz prison on July 30, 1981 at 11 pm.
