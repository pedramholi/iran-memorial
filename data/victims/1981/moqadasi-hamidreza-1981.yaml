    News of the execution of Mr. Hamidreza Moqadasi, son of Ahmad, along with
    28 others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August 12,
    1981. Mr. Hamidreza Moqadasi is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Hamidreza Moqadasi were published in the report as
    "uprising, armed action against the Islamic Revolution of Iran, being a
    high ranking member of the Peykar Organization, distribution and copying
    the publications of this organization, establishing cells to overthrow the
    Islamic Republic, and being in charge of logistics and organization of
    Peykar in the Eastern Azarbaijan province." “Apostasy” was another charge
    against Mr. Moqadasi. These charges are the same for all five sympathizers
    of the Peykar Organization. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hamidreza Moqadasi's
    defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz declared Mr.
    Hamidreza Moqadasi guilty of “waging war on God”. He was condemned to
    death. The ruling was carried out and he was executed in the Tabriz prison
    yard on August 10, 1981 at night. No exact information is available about
    the details of the court verdict.
