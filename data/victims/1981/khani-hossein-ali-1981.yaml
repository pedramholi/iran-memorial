    Mr. Hossein Ali Khani is also one of the 430 individuals whose name
    appears on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those members of the
    Organization who died after the Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the
    individuals on this list have been executed. Additionally, his name is
    mentioned in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. According to the form, he was a
    mathematics teacher. Moreover, the book From an Ebullient Ideal published
    by former sympathizers of the Peykar Organization in August of 1985. The
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by
    a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
