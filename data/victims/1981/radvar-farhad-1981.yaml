circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Farhad Radvar was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on
    December 29, 1981, and in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. This addendum lists
    12028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    newspapers report calls Mr. Radvar and his co-defendant “two of the
    leaders of the apostate group-let of Fadaiyan Minority in Karaj.” The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and
    was active mainly in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest
    and detention The details of Mr. Radvar’s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial There is no information regarding this trial, other than Mr.
    Radvar was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Karaj. Charges
    The newspaper announces the charges against Mr. Radvar and his
    co-defendant as “three counts of armed robbery, carrying arms,
    distribution of the Organization’s publications, and plotting against the
    regime of the Islamic Republic.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Radvar’s defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Karaj called Mr. Farhad Radvar an “enemy
    of God” and condemned him to death. He was shot by a firing squad in Karaj
    on December 28, 1981 at dawn.
