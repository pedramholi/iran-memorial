    the former Soviet Union. Mr. Na imi was 2 years old when his family was
    exiled first to the city of Mashhad, and then to the city of Yazd [both in
    Iran] for their religious beliefs. Mr. Na imi performed his mandatory
    military service in the city of Hamedan and subsequently took up residence
    there. Prior to the 1979 Revolution, he was the head of the Combatting
    Malaria Administration at the City of Hamedan s Health Ministry [Branch].
    He also taught at Bu Ali Sina (Avicenna) University in Hamedan for a
    while. In 1979, Mr. Na imi was fired from the Health Ministry and started
    working at a hospital while keeping his own medical practice as well. Mr.

    Iran Wire). Mr. Na imi was married. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in
    Iran). He was a member of the Hamedan Spiritual Assembly** and its
    supervisor. (Andalib, Spring 1988). Mr. Na imi was summoned by Hamedan
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office in the summer of 1979. (Iran
    Wire). This case is related to the arrest of 7 members of the Hamedan s
    Baha i Spiritual Assembly in 1980. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran: Background The Baha i religious community is the largest minority
    group in Iran, with approximately 300,000 members in 1979 (more current
    figures are not available).*** The authorities of the Islamic Republic
    have subjected Baha is religious to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence. **** Arrest and detention Mr. Na imi was arrested
    on August 9, or 10, 1980, on an arrest warrant issued by the Revolutionary
    Court, and was temporarily released on August 11, and told to return in
    three days. Before the end of the 3-day period, however, members of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran Revolutionary Guards Corps house raided and
    arrested him and several other members of the Hamedan Baha i Spiritual
    Assembly on August 13, 1980. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran, Iran
    Wire). Mr. Na imi spent 21 days at the Revolutionary Guards detention
    center and was subsequently transferred to the Police Force prison. He
    endured physical torture during detention. Mr. Na imi was denied
    visitations for 3 months after his arrest. (Archives of Baha i Persecution
    in Iran). His and his co-defendants cell was located next to the ward
    toilets and was so small that they had to take turns sleeping. According
    to handwritten notes obtained from one of Mr. Na imi s co-defendants, they
    were incarcerated in a dirty and polluted environment and were deprived of
    the most basic health and hygiene requirements, including showering .
    According to this person, in order to combat lice and other pollutants,
    they used [bleach, detergents,] and heavy duty chemical cleansers multiple
    times a day. (Iran Wire). Mr. Na imi s and his co-defendants families
    wrote numerous letters to Iran s government officials and judicial
    authorities in order to have them lift their visitation ban. According to
    the families of Mr. Na imi s co-defendants, the prison guards did not
    allow the prisoners and their families to speak to one another in their
    first visitation. Mr. Na imi and his ward mates were allowed two
    visitations per week with their families. (Iran Wire). According to the
