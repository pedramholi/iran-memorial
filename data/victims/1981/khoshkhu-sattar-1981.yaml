    News and information regarding the execution of Mr. Sattar Khoshkhu (also
    spelled " Khushkhu"), son of Ali, and two other individuals* was published
    in Kayhan (May 2, and 5, 1981), Khabar-e Jonoob (May 2, 1981), Ettela at
    (May 2, 1981), and Jomhuri Eslami (May 3, 1981) newspapers. Additional
    information about this case was obtained from the Archives of Baha i
    Persecution in Iran website, Golshan-e Eshgh Facebook page (May 6, 2019),
    as well as from documents existing at the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center,
    including Mr. Mehdizadeh s letters written in prison and the death
    certificate dated May 1, 1981, issued by the Fars Province Judiciary. Mr.
    Khoshkhu was one of the 206 individuals whose name was published in the
    Worldwide Baha i Community s 1999 report. This report, entitled The Baha i
    Question: Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious
    Community , dealt with the persecution of members of the Baha i faith in
    Iran by the Islamic Republic, and contained a list of Baha is who were
    killed in Iran since 1979. Mr. Khoshkhu was born into a Baha i family in
    the city of Shiraz in 1918-19. He was one year old when he lost his
    mother. Mr. Khoshkhu studied in Shiraz schools and upon graduating,
    started a pharmacy in the town of Estahbanat where he also worked. A few
    years later, he was hired by the Ministry of Education s health clinic. He
    was married in 1941-42 and had children. According to Mr. Khoshkhu s
    child, he was not concerned with materialistic things and always helped
    the poor. He always carried a large briefcase containing Baha i books and
    literature, and went from one street, one neighborhood, and one house, to
    the next [promoting the Baha i faith]. He would not rest for even a single
    minute. He would leave the house at dawn after prayer, and would most
    often come home past midnight, exhausted, but in high spirits, joyous for
    having been of service . (Golshan-e Eshgh Facebook page). The Baha is in
    the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979**- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.*** Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention Shiraz Comiteh agents
    arrested Mr. Khoshkhu on June 3, 1980. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in
    Iran website, Golshan-e Eshgh Facebook page). No other detail is available
    about this arrest and detention. After a while, Mr. Khoshkhu was
    transferred to Shiraz Adelabad Prison where he spent approximately one
    year. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran website). Mr. Khoshkhu was
    allowed visitations with his family during detention. (Golshan-e Eshgh
    Facebook page). Trial There are no information available on the trial
    session/s of Mr. Khoshkhu. Charges State-run newspapers enumerated the
    same charges for the three co-defendants in this case. These charges
    included: 1. Efforts and activities toward strengthening the vile Pahlavi
    regime; 2. Membership in the West Asia espionage organization in
    connection with imperialism and Zionism; 3. Active membership in the Baha
    i Zionist organization; 4. Controlling Shiraz clergymen and religious
    scholars during the Islamic Revolution; 5. Working toward disseminating
    the culture of heresy and infidelity, particularly among pure-hearted
    village folk and tribes people; 6. Attempting to exhume the body of a
    Moslem individual in order to dispatch the remains to Israel with the
    cooperation of those with allegiances to the previous regime, the
    then-Governor [of Fars Province], and the then-Custodian of the Shah-e
    Cheragh Holy Site; 7. Having contacts with se
