    Mr. Hassan Nazari is one of the 451 individuals whose name appears on the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Peykar. This list includes the
    names of Peykar Organization members who have lost their lives following
    the 1979 Islamic Revolution. More than 400 individuals in this list have
    been executed. According to the Peykar website, Mr. Nazari was a student.
    The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social-imperialist” state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention No information is available regarding Mr.
    Nazari’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Nazari’s trial. Charges No information is available on charges brought
    against Mr. Nazari. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Nazari. Defense No information is available on Mr. Nazari’s defense.
    Judgment According to the information provided in the Peykar
    Organization’s list, Mr. Nazari was executed in the summer of 1981 in
    Bandar Abbas.
