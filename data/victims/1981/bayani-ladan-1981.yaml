    An activist and medical student in Tabriz, Ms. Bayani sought to improve
    the lives of workers and their families. Her 5-year prison sentence would
    end early. The following information about Ms. Ladan Bayani has been drawn
    from an interview with her sister and the second volume of the Book of
    Prison (Noghteh Books, 2001). This execution was also announced in the
    addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985, as well as from the Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper (August 31, 1981). Ms. Ladan Bayani, daughter of Mohammad
    Ali, was born in Rasht on October 29, 1957. She studied medicine at Tabriz
    University and spent a year studying in Geneva. In Tabriz, she was a
    student activist and a member of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class. Under the previous regime, she was
    sentenced to five years in prison (January 1977) for her connections with
    groups with communist ideologies and for acting against national security,
    but she was released after nine months. After the Revolution, she
    continued her political activities in Peykar, and later in the Red Star
    group. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The Red Star
    group ( Setareh-ye Sorkh ), was created by a number of individuals who
    split from Peykar in 1980 over tactical disagreements. The group was
    opposed to the Islamic Republic regime, rejected armed struggle, and
    believed in the fundamental role of organizing the industrial and
    agricultural labor force, and the student movement. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government in 1981 caused the dismantling of
    the Red Star. Arrest and detention Ms. Ladan Bayani was arrested by the
    Revolutionary Guards on June 28, 1981 in a safe house in the west of
    Tehran (Shahr-e Ziba) along with Akbar Aghbashlu, also from the Red Star,
    who was executed with her. A neighbor had reportedly become suspicious of
    the activities in the house and had reported them to the authorities.
    After the arrest, the house was in complete chaos and a shoe belonging to
    Akbar was found in the yard. According to the interviewee, Ms. Bayani was
    denied the right to be represented by an attorney and was detained
    incommunicado. Available evidence and witnesses strongly suggest that she
    was detained at Evin Prison. During Ms. Bayani s two-month detention, her
    mother visited various Tehran prisons, including Evin, but was never able
    to obtain any information on the detention location. Trial Ms. Bayani was
    tried by the Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal on August 29, 1981. No
    further information is available on the trial(s). Charges According to the
    Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal s communiqu published by Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper, Ms. Bayani was charged with plotting and armed rebellion
    against the Islamic Revolution and defenseless people, being a corruptor
    on earth, and an enemy of God and God s prophet. The same communiqu also
    mentioned being an archivist for the Red Star group among the charges. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Bayani s defense. Judgment Ms. Bayani
    was sentenced to death by the Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal and
    executed. The family was not informed of the execution and learned of it
    from the communiqu published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August 31,
    1981. According to the interviewee, Ms. Bayani s mother went to Evin
    authorities, showed them the newspaper and asked for her daughter s will.
    The prison authorities informed her that her daughter had left all her
    belongings to other prisoners and that they were not aware of her burial
    place. After extensive searches, Ms. Bayani s family concluded that she
    was buried at the Khavaran cemetery, where there is now a stone to
    commemorate her.
