    News of Mr. Mansur Firuzi, son of Musa was sent to the Boroumand
    Foundation via two electronic forms, by persons familiar with his case.
    This information has not been confirmed by other sources. According to
    this information, Mr. Firuzi was a two-year program college student in
    Sari, and was born in 1961-62 in the town of Zabol, Sistan and Baluchestan
    Province, in a middle class family, and was a supporter of the MKO. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention According to the information contained in
    the forms, Mr. Firuzi was arrested at his home in the town of Zabol some
    time in 1980 (or 1981) when universities were closed subsequent to the
    cultural revolution. In the course of her sister s arrest, Mr. Firuzi
    became angry and insulted Ayatollah Khomeini as well as the agents who had
    come to arrest his sister. The agents then took him to Zabol Revolutionary
    Committee jail. He was detained at Zabol Revolutionary Committee. He was
    deprived of his right to an attorney. Trial No precise information is
    available on the defendant s trial. According to available information,
    Zahedan Islamic Revolutionary Court issued the decision in Mr. Firuzi s
    case. Charges According to information contained in the forms, Mr. Firuzi
    s charge is stated to have been insulting the leader of the Revolution,
    Ayatollah Khomeini. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence against Mr.
    Firuzi consisted of the Committee agents testimony and the acceptance
    thereof by Mr. Firuzi. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Firuzi's defense. Judgment According to
    the information contained in the forms, Mr. Firuzi was sentenced to death
    by the Zahedan Court. The sentence was carried out in April-May 1981 in
    Zahedan and he was shot by a firing squad. Mr. Firuzi was 20 years old.
    _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
