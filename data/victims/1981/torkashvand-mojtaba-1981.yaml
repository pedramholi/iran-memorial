    News of the execution of Mr. Mojtaba Torkashvand, son of Fathali, along
    with two others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August
    31, 1981. The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kermanshah issued an
    announcement concerning these executions, the defendants' names, and their
    charges, and the Public Relations Department of the Central Public
    Prosecutor’s Office released it to the Pars news agency. He is one of the
    430 individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr.
    Torkashvand is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Mojtaba Torkashvand were announced as, “membership in
    the American group of Peykar, being an active member of this organization,
    participating and organizing the connections among Hamadan, Kermanshah,
    and Tehran, and believing in the armed struggle.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Torkashvand’s defense. Judgment َThe Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Kermanshah identified Mr. Torkashvand as “an enemy
    of God and His People and a corruptor on earth” and condemned him to
    death. He was executed in Kermanshah on August 30, 1981 at 2 a.m.
