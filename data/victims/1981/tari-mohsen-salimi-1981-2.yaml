circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mohsen Salimi Tari, son of Zatollah, and 21 other
    individuals was announced by the Public Relations section of the Central
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office and published in the Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper on December 26, 1981. Mr. Salimi Tari is also one of the
    12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Salimi Tari was a
    high school student, affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial, other than he was tried at the Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal. Charges The personal charges brought against Mr.
    Salimi Tari are not known. He and 18 other individuals were collectively
    charged with: “Plotting and rebellion against the regime of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran, participation in armed demonstration, including the
    demonstration of June 20, providing place and financing for the Hypocrites
    [i.e. the Mojahedin Khalq Organization], participation in assassinations
    of the Revolutionary Guards brothers, possession of arms and ammunitions,
    active membership in armed teams of the Hypocrites, and living in safe
    houses.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. The demonstration of June 20, 1981, took place in protest
    against the parliament’s impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic
    Republic’s systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) from the country’s political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah
    Khomeini to meet with MKO leaders and his insistence for them to disarm.
    The MKO had until then supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    agreed to function within the framework of the new political system. On
    June 20, the Organization officially changed its policy and tried to
    overthrow the regime by organizing mass demonstrations, in which some of
    the demonstrators were armed, all over the country. These demonstrations,
    which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of
    demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that targeted not only
    the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized as
    official government policy the months-old state harassment and suppression
    of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Salimi Tari’s defense. Judgment
    The Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Mr. Mohsen Salimi
    Tari to death. According to the Mojahed magazine, he was shot by a firing
    squad in Tehran on December 20, 1981. He was only 16 years old.
