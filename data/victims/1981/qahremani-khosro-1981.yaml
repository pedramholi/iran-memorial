    The information about Mr. Khosro Qahremani, son of Gholam Reza, has been
    sent to Omid through an electronic mail. His name is also mentioned in the
    book Fallen for Freedom: 20,000 PMOI Martyrs published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO) in 2006. He was born in Tehran in April 1961 and
    was a sympathizer of this Organization. He graduated from Darolfonun high
    school in 1981 and began his full time political activities. In 1981, one
    of the centers of political activities on Ray Street in Tehran was raided
    by the Hezbollah militia and those present at the center were battered and
    injured. After this event, political activists of the center, including
    Mr. Qahremani, went underground. According to himself, he was followed by
    Iranian officials a few times in the summer of 1981. He gave his will to a
    family member in late September 1981. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Qahremani’s arrest and detention are not known. On
    September 27, he left the house to participate in the MKO demonstration
    and never returned. After this date, his house was raided and searched by
    Iranian officials. Despite their search in various prisons in the Tehran
    province, his family did not find any information on his whereabouts.
    Following the repression of the demonstration of June 20, 1981, which
    protested the parliament’s impeachment of President Banisadr and the
    Islamic Republic’s systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization from the country’s political scene, and the mass executions
    that followed the demonstration, the MKO turned to armed opposition to the
    regime of the Islamic Republic. The MKO sought to organize demonstrations
    in order to attract public support and overthrow the regime. The
    demonstration of September 27, 1981, was such an event in which many of
    the MKO sympathizers were arrested. According to official newspapers, the
    demonstration resulted in the death of several Revolutionary Guards,
    supporters of the MKO, as well as some bystanders. Two days later, the
    Kayhan newspaper announced the execution of 54 demonstrators. Trial There
    is no information regarding his trial. Charges The charges brought against
    the defendant are not known. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense No
    information is available concerning his defense. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the verdict leading to this execution.
    According to the MKO book, Mr. Khosro Qahremani was executed in 1981.
    According to the information sent to Omid, he, most probably, was executed
    in mass executions that followed the September 27 demonstration. One of
    his friends, who accompanied him in most political activities, was
    arrested following this demonstration and was imprisoned for many years.
    He later stated that he had never met Mr. Qahremani in prison. The
    Qahremani family searched for Khosro in many prisons in Tehran province.
    Prison officials told them: “He’s not in prison. Don’t search for him.” In
    his will, Mr. Qahremani wrote: “If one lives for only an hour, but lives
    honorably, it is better than one who lives a hundred years and does not
    leave any legacy in this world. One should fight and not passively observe
    the crimes and treasons that take place.” Addressing his family, he asked
    them not to cry for his death and said: “I told you many times that I
    cannot fail this work. This is the path of God, and this is the duty of a
    Muslim and a human being.”
