circumstances: >
    The information about the execution Mr. Ali Reza Reza'i was published by
    the newspaper Kayhan on July 16th , 1981. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. A 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on
    drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone) of
    proscribed narcotics has been used to sentence thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers to death, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr. Reza'i was accused of
    "carrying 2500 grams of heroin". Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rezai's
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Hamedan issued the
    death sentence against Mr. Reza'i, and the Supreme Judicial Council
    approved it. Mr. Reza'i was executed at dawn on Thursday July 16th, 1981.
