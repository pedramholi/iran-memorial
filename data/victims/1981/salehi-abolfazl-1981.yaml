    Mr. Abolfazl Salehi (Communist Unity) is one of the 12028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Vahdat-e Komonisti (Communist
    Unity) Organization was founded in November 1978 by Communist political
    activists, particularly students who were educated outside the country and
    returned to Iran, as well as similar-minded activists inside the country.
    The history of its founding dates back to the Ettehadieh Komonist-ha
    (Communist Union), which was formed outside Iran in the late 1960’s. The
    members of Vahdat-e Komonisti identified themselves as supporters of
    “political-military struggle for the preparation and accomplishment of a
    Socialist revolution,” and as leftists opposed to Stalinism and Maoism.
    Among the activities of this organization were critiques of the political
    and ideological standpoints of political organizations in Iran via
    publication of Raha’i , the main publication of the Vahdat-e Komonisti.
    ِDuring the massive crackdown on opposition groups in June 1981, the
    organization faced significant crises and split into various factions.
    Members of the organization outside Iran continued their activism until
    1986 through the publication of Andisheh Raha’i and Bultan-e Akhbar-e Iran
    (the Bulletin of Iranian News). Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge brought against
    the defendant is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Salehi’s defense.
    Judgment There is no information on the verdict leading to this execution.
