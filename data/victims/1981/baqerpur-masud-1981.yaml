    Information about Mr. Mas ud Baqerpur, son of Alireza, is based on two
    electronic forms sent to Omid by persons familiar with his case. News of
    the execution of Mr. Baqerpur, along with twelve others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami Daily on January 3, 1982. The report quoted a communiqu
    from the Public Relations Office of the Islamic Revolution s Chief Public
    Prosecutor. He is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No, 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. According to the existing information, Mr. Baqerpur
    was 24 years old, born and resided in Takab (Azarbaijan-e Gharbi
    province). He earned his high school diploma in Math and was a university
    student, single, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam to be their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the
    1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to a split within the Marxist-Leninist Section
    of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of
    the MKO were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and to recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were primary in the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, whether by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic s
    leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Baqerpur s arrest
    and detention are not known. According to one electronic form, he was
    arrested in Takab. Trial No information is available on Mr. Baqerpur s
    trial. According to the communiqu of the Public Relations Office of the
    Islamic Revolution s Chief Public Prosecutor, the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Sanandaj issued the ruling against Mr. Baqerpur. Charges
    According to the communiqu of the Public Relations Office of the Islamic
    Revolution s Chief Public Prosecutor, the charges against Mr. Baqerpur and
    another person were charged with the following: armed insurrection against
    the Islamic Republic of Iran; extensive collaboration with the
    [Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization or MKO] and being involved in
    pro-organization activities; establishing the Students Islamic Association
    in Takab; holding sessions and attracting people to the organization;
    participation in discussions in the streets, which resulted in clashes;
    providing financial support for the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and
    supporting their positions. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Baqerpur. Defense No information is available concerning Mr. Baqerpur s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Sanandaj identified
    Mr. Mas ud Baqerpur as Mofsed [corruptor on earth], Mohareb [fighter
    against God], and Baghi [rebel] against the Islamic government. He was
    sentenced to death and was executed in Sanandaj on December 31, 1981, at
    dawn. _________________________ * The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach th
