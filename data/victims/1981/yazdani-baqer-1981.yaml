    News of the execution of Mr. Baqer Yazdani, son of Abbas, along with
    eighteen others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on September 19,
    1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor’s
    Office issued an announcement conserning these executions, the defendants'
    names, and their charges, and released it to the Pars news agency. Mr.
    Baqer Yazdani is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list
    of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains
    the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Mr. Baqer Yazdani is one of the 12,028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of
    dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Baqer Yazdani were announced as, "membership in the
    anti-Islamic organization of Peykar, being in charge of the Peykar
    Organization in Mahmudabad, Daldal [student] Committee, and the village of
    Ahlam." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Baqer Yazdani's defense.
    Judgment َThe Central Islamic Revolutionary Court identified Mr. Baqer
    Yazdani as "Mohareb (fighter) against God and the Prophet, and Mofsed
    (corruptor on Earth)." He was condemned to death, and the ruling carried
    out in the Evin prison yard on September 19, 1981. No exact information is
    available about the details of the court verdict.
