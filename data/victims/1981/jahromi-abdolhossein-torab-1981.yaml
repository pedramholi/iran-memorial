    The information about Mr. Abdolhossein Torab Jahromi has been taken from
    an interview with a family friend. He is one of the 12028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985 (his name is printed Abdolhossein
    Torab Jahromi). The list includes individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Mr. Torab was born in Jahrom (Fars province) and lived with
    his family in Shiraz. He was a high school student and a sympathizer of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He distributed MKO leaflets throughout
    the city using his motorcycle. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    his arrest and detention are not known other than he was arrested in
    Shiraz in the spring or early summer of 1981 and taken to the detention
    center of the Revolutionary Guards Corps. Trial Based on available
    information, Mr. Torab did not have serious charges. His family members
    were expecting his release. This coincided with Ayatollah Sadeq
    Khalkhali’s visit to Shiraz. According to his cellmates, one night he was
    taken to Khalkhali for trial. Charges The charge brought against the
    defendant is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Torab’s defense. His
    cellmates state that he was not charged with crimes that were punishable
    by death. They suspect that Mr. Torab might have laughed in Khalkhali’s
    presence and that was the basis for his execution. Judgment Khalkhali
    condemned Mr. Torab to death. Based on the Mojahed magazine, he was shot
    by firing squad on August 24, 1981. He was 17 years old.
