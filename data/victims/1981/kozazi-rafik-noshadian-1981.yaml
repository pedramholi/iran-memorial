    The information about Mr. Rafik Noshadian Kozazi is taken from the book
    Our Martyrs for Freedom, For Socialism by Rah-e Kargar Publications. Born
    in Tehran in 1957, he went to India to continue his education in 1980.
    There, he joined the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran (Rah-e
    Kargar) and later returned to Iran in order to participate in the
    political activities. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran" was established during the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They
    identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown. Mr.
    Rafik Noshadian Kozazi was arrested on October 15, 1981 and transferred to
    Evin prison. According to the above book, he had no visits with his
    family. Only before his execution, he was allowed to talk with his parents
    on the phone. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges No information is available on Mr. Rafik Noshadian Kozazi’s
    charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available about his defense. Judgment No specific information is available
    about the verdict leading to this execution. Mr. Rafik Noshadian Kozazi
    was executed by a firing squad at Evin Prison on November 29, 1981. In his
    will, which was partially crossed out, he addressed “all those whom I
    love” and wrote: “These are my last words with you. I wish you success… My
    dear parents and sisters, I hear your voices and I am leaving this world
    in peace. My dear nieces, live with dignity and truth, and do not accept
    any disgrace. Life with disgrace is no better than death.”
