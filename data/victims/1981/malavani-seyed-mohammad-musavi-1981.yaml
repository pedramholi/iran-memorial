    The execution of Mr. Seyyed Mohammad Musavi Malvani and three others was
    announced in a communique of the public relations office of the Chief
    Public Prosecutor on December 6, 1981 (Jomhuri Eslami daily). Mr. Musavi
    Malavani (Mojahedin Khalq Iran) is also one of the 12028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of
    Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of
    Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the
    Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic
    and social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Musavi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on Mr. Musavi s trial. Charges Mr. Musavi Malvani who was
    referred to as "a sympathizer of the Monafeqin [Hypocrites; term used by
    the Islamic Republic to refer to members of the People's Mojahedin of
    Iran]," was charged with "armed rebellion against the regime of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran", "martyring two Muslim brothers in Some'eh Sara"
    and "injuring 7 people." Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against
    Mr. Musavi Malvani included "possession of a Colt revolver", "his
    forthright confession", and "testimony of witnesses." Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Musavi Malvani's defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Some'eh Sara declared Mr. Musavi Malvani
    guilty of "corruption on earth", "waging war against God" and "rebellion."
    He was executed at dawn. _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO
    members from government offices and the closure of their centers and
    publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities
    different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two.
    Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and
    the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin
    sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while distributing
    publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20,
    1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by
    governmental officials and the government officials efforts to impeach
    their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the
    authorities called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and
    Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from this
    demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were arrested
    and executed in the following days and weeks. The day after the
    demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a repressive campaign
    unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and
    sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO
    announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and assassinated
    a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the Islamic regime.
    In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the impeached President
    (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they founded the National
    Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many of its members were
    expelled from France, they went to Iraq and founded the National
    Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which entered Iranian territory a few
    times during the Iran-Iraq war. They were defeated in July 1988 during
    their last operation, the
