    The information about Mr. Javad Shahyar is based on an interview with a
    person close to him. A short biography is published in the book Our
    Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism published by the Rah-e Kargar
    organization under the name Mahmud Shahyar. It is probable that he was
    known as Mahmud inside the Organization. He was born in Tehran in 1957. He
    was an architecture student at National University and a sympathizer of
    the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran (Rah-e Kargar). According
    to the above mentioned book, prior to the “Cultural Revolution” he was
    active in leftist student groups, and after the universities were closed,
    he continued his political activism in some regions in the west of Tehran
    city. “Rah-e Kargar” or the “Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran”
    was established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who had rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They introduced themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini’s
    leadership. The Cultural Revolution began after Ayatollah Khomeini gave a
    speech in March 1980 and ordered that universities be purged of all those
    who opposed his regime and be transformed into “learning environments” [as
    opposed to political forums] where “an all-Islamic curriculum” is taught.
    The first wave of violence began on April 15, 1980 during a speech by
    Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic
    Revolution and Minister of Interior] at the University of Tabriz.
    Following the speech, students supporting the regime took control of the
    University’s central building and demanded that the “university be purged”
    from “pro-Shah elements and other sellouts.” On April 18, the Council of
    the Islamic Revolution issued a communiqué accusing political groups of
    converting higher education institutions into “headquarters of discordant
    political activities” and naming them as obstacles to the radical
    transformation of the universities. The communiqué gave these groups three
    days (Saturday April 19 to Monday April 21) to shut down their activities
    in the universities. The Council stressed that the decision included
    libraries along with activities related to arts and sports. Political
    groups, which recruited members and had strong support in the
    universities, refused to evacuate. Before the end of the Council’s
    deadline, serious clashes took place between leftist groups and Islamist
    Associations, in opposition to the Associations, sometimes supported by
    security forces and paramilitary groups. These clashes, which peaked at
    the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in the death of several people
    and the wounding of hundreds of others on university campuses around the
    country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic authorities announced the
    victory of the Cultural Revolution and the closure of all universities in
    order to Islamicize the curricula. The universities remained closed for
    two years. One of the outcomes of the Cultural Revolution was the purging
    of many university professors and students based on their political
    beliefs. Arrest and detention The exact circumstances of Mr. Javad
    Shahyar’s arrest and detention are not known. According to the
    interviewee, he was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards, along with three
    other individuals, as they were sitting in a parked car in August, 1981.
    He was transferred to Evin prison. He had no visitation with his family.
    According to the interviewee, he was tortured in prison. Trial No
    information is available on his trial other than, according to the
    interviewee, the trial took place at Evin prison. Charges According to the
    interviewee, the charge against Mr. Javad Shahyar was announced as
    “apostasy”. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available about his defense other than he was
    denied the right to have an attorney. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the execution sentence. Mr. Javad Shahyar was executed by
    a firing squad on September 22, 1981.
