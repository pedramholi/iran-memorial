    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with

    Mr. Bolurian Mahabadi, son of Esma il and Afsar, was born in 1954 in
    Mahabad (West Azarbaijan Province), and he went to school in this town. In
    1971, he enrolled at Aryamehr University of Technology in Tehran (renamed
    Sharif) where he began his political activism against the Monarchy along
    with other Marxist students. In 1975, he graduated with a degree in
    mechanical engineering. He was arrested later that year due to his
    political activities and beliefs. He was reportedly tortured in prison. He
    was imprisoned until September 1979. After being released, he declined a
    scholarship offer to study in the United States of America, in order to
    continue his political opposition to the Pahlavi regime. Following the
    Revolution of February 1979, Mr. Bolurian Mahabadi joined the Komaleh
    Organization along with a few friends. However, he soon left this
    organization. According to the available information, he did not believe
    that armed struggle was the only option to oppose the Islamic Republic.
    Before any action or decision, he thought he needed to study the issue at
    hand empirically and learn more about the subject matter. The person who
    sent information about Mr. Bolurian Mahabadi states that he was a
    sympathizer of all leftist parties; he was a communist interested in
    ideology and implementation of ideological policies for the improvement of
    social conditions, rather than organizational differences and conflicts
    among various leftist parties. In the fall of 1980, Mr. Bolurian Mahabadi
    joined the Razmandegan Organization and later joined the Sahand
    Organization. In July 1981, he lived with a relative in Vanak neighborhood
    of Tehran. He was last seen on Resalat Street in Tehran in August 1981.
    Since then, his family members were unaware of his whereabouts. By this
    time, he had chosen a fake name, Hamid Boluri, and had a forged birth
    certificate. The Kayhan newspaper refers to him using this name. The
    person who sent information about Mr. Bolurian Mahabadi refers to him as a
    very talented student with an exceptional gift in mathematics and science,
    and a great chess player. The Sahand Organization (or Ettehad-e
    Mobarezan-e Komonist) was founded after the Islamic Revolution of February
    1979, with a specific focus on ideology. After Sahand developed the
    project of the Communist Party of Iran in 1982, and the Party was founded
    by Sahand and Komala and remainders of Communist organizations such as
    Peykar, Razmandegan, and some affiliates of the Fadaiyan Khalq. Komala in
    Kurdistan became the center of the Communist Party of Iran, whose main
    publication was the Communist, a monthly magazine. Arrest and detention
