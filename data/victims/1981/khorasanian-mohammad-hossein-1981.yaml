    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Hossein Khorasanian, son of
    Mohammad, along with seven others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on August 19, 1981 and the Kayhan newspaper the next day. The
    Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor’s Office
    issued a statement concerning these executions, the defendants’ names and
    their charges, and released it to the Pars news agency. Mr. Khorasanian is
    one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of
    the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published
    on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. Moreover, his name appears among
    the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985.
    The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups,
    who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic
    security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    Additionally, his will and execution is mentioned in the Peykar
    publication (No. 122, October 12, 1981). He wrote his will, using the
    nickname of Faridoddin Musavi, before being arrested on June 24, 1981. The
    will was taken by the regime’s agents on the same day. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention According to the Peykar publication, based on the date of
    his will, Mr. Khorasanian was arrested on June 24, 1981. The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Khorasanian were announced as being “a sympathizer of the
    fighting organization of Peykar, possession of a hand-made grenade,
    forging an ID card of the Imam Propaganda Office with the name of Ali
    Soleimani, active membership of Peykar and distribution of its
    publications.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Khorasanian’s defense. Judgment
    َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qom identified Mr. Khorasanian as
    “being at war with God and a rebel against the Islamic Regime.” He was
    condemned to death and was executed by firing squad in Qom on August 18,
    1981. He was a high school student.
