    Information regarding the life and extrajudicial execution of Ms. Mojgan
    (Nilufar) Rezvanian, daughter of Shahnaz and Hushang, was submitted to the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center through two electronic forms, email, and an
    audio file, by a person close to her (June 18, and August 10, 2020). News
    of this murder was also published in Kayhan newspaper (April 21, and 22,
    1981). Additional information regarding this case was obtained from the
    Peykar Publication, Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class print publication (April 27, and May 18, 1981); Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper (April 21, 1981); Nameh Mardom, Tudeh Party of Iran s central
    print publication (May 2, 1981); the Book Goriz-e Nagozir (2008-09);
    Khavaran and Radio Farda websites (April 20, 2021); and Gooya website
    (June 3, 2021). Ms. Rezvanian was 16 years old, born in Tehran, single,
    and a nurse s assistant in training at the Borzuyeh School. She was the
    granddaughter of a famous poet and lyricist, Mahmud Sana i. Ms. Rezvanian
    was a supporter of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class and worked at the Organization s the D. D. Section (D and D
    standing for Danshju and Daneshamuz , meaning college student and high
    school student, respectively). Ms. Rezvanian was interested in music,
    poetry, and dance. The Peykar Organization The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Cultural Revolution
    The Cultural Revolution began upon Ayatollah Khomeini s order in March
    1980, to purge universities of all forces opposed [to the regime] and to
    transform them into learning environments [as opposed to political forums]
    where an all-Islamic curriculum would be taught. The first wave of
    violence began on April 15, 1980, during a speech by Akbar Hashemi
    Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister
    of the Interior] at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech,
    students supporting the regime took control of the University s central
    building and demanded that the university be purged from pro-Shah elements
    and other sellouts. On April 18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution
    issued a communiqu accusing political groups of converting higher
    education institutions into headquarters of discordant political
    activities and naming them as obstacles to the radical transformation of
    the universities. The communiqu gave these groups three days (Saturday,
    April 19 to Monday, April 21) to shut down their offices and activities in
    the universities. The Council stressed that the closure included libraries
    as well as offices related to arts and sports activities. Political
    opposition groups refused to shut down their offices and during those
    three days, clashes continued between leftist groups and Islamist
    Associations, which took control of the universities with the support of
    governmental forces and paramilitary groups. These clashes peaked at the
    end of the three-day deadline issued by the Council of the Revolution,
    resulting in the death of several people and the wounding of hundreds of
    others on university campuses across the country. On April 21, the Islamic
    Republic authorities announced the victory of the Cultural Revolution and
    the closure of all universities for two years. As a result of the Cultural
    Revolution, a large number of university professors were purged and a
    great many students were deprived of continuing their education because of
    their political beliefs. The Explosion After the closure of universities
    in May 1980, protests by political groups and organizations continued
    against the shutdown. On April 20, 1981, the anniversary of the closure of
    universities, a call for protest demonstrations was issued by the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class Student Section (D.
    D. Section) in front of Tehran University [demanding] the reopening of
    universities. Mehrdad Darvishpur, one of the organizers of the
    demonstrations stated in this regard: The objective of the demonstrations
    was to protest the Cultural Revolution. [Peykar s] Student Organization
    was not so na ve as to think that universities would reopen just because a
    thousand people protested in front of Tehran University; th
