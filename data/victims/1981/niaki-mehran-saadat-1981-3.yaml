    Mr. Mehran Sa’adat Niaki, son of Mohammad Reza, is one of the 430
    individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Additional
    information was sent by a relative of the defendant through an electronic
    form to the Omid site. According to the electronic form, Mr. Sa’adat Niaki
    was born to a middle-class family in Amol in 1959. He was single and a
    radiology student. He had three brothers and one sister. Ali Reza, one of
    his brothers, was executed by firing squad in Evin prison on September 16,
    1981. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention Mr. Sa’adat Niaki was arrested in Mashhad,
    but the circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    No information is available on Mr. Sa’adat Niaki’s charges. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Sa’adat Niaki’s defense. Judgment Mr. Sa’adat Niaki died
    under torture in Chalus prison on December 2, 1981 (electronic form).
