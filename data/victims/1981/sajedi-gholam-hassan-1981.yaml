    News of the execution of Mr. Gholam Hassan Sajedi, son of Abolhassan, was
    sent to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation via an electronic form by his
    sister on October 5, 2016. He is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in
    an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Additional information was taken from the website of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. (June 9, 1980) Mr. Sajedi was born in
    Bandar-e Anzali. He was single, a high school graduate, a noncommissioned
    soldier, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He joined
    the organization during the revolution in 1979 when he was only 17 years
    old. His activities were in the Misaq Youths Association connected to the
    Mojahedin in Naziabad quarter in Tehran. These activities included helping
    needy people in the neighborhood (website of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization). He was a kind person who loved people. His words and
    actions at home or society were harmonious. His brother was also executed
    in Bandar-e Anzali on August 30, 1981. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of
    Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of
    Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the
    Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic
    and social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention Mr. Sajedi was
    arrested by Revolutionary Guards, without a warrant, in a street in
    Bandar-e Anzali on September 21, 1981. He detained for 29 days and had
    three visitations. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Rasht tried Mr. Sajedi. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Sajedi was sympathy with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Sajedi. However,
    he was well-known as a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    Bandar-e Anzali. Defense Mr. Sajedi defended himself during his trial.
    However, no information is available on his defense. Revolutionary Guards
    possess a video film of his defense . He was denied access to an attorney.
    Judgment Mr. Gholam Hassan Sajedi was executed by firing squad in Bandar-e
    Anzali on October 20, 1981. His body was buried at the Bandar-e Anzali
    cemetery. His mother had seen marks of wounds and torture on her son s
    body. _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the authorities called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hez
