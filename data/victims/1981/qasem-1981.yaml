    News of the execution of Mr. Qasem, son of Asghar, a resident of Daregaz,
    was published in the Kayhan newspaper on October 4, 1981. Arrest and
    detention There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    This trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Quchan.
    Charges The charge against Mr. Qasem was announced as, raping an
    eleven-year-old girl. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Qasem's defense. Judgment The Court condemned Mr. Qasem to death and
    the ruling was carried out. No specific information is available about the
    defendant s date of execution.
