    The persecution of Hashem Farnush, a Baha i and an alumnus of Tehran
    University in Literature, did not end with his execution. Ten years after
    his execution, government agents raided his home in an attempt to arrest
    him. Information about the execution of Mr. Hashem Farnush, son of
    Ataollah and Batul Mobin, married and father of two, was obtained from
    multiple sources including Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights
    in Iran (ABC) interview with his cousin, Mr. Zia Missaghi, on October 31,
    2023. Additional sources are the article the article Tehran Prosecutor s
    Office Communiqu , published in the Ettelaat and Keyhan newspapers on June
    23, 1981, and The Historical Role of Ayatollah Mahdavi Kani in the Islamic
    Revolution, which appeared in the Student News Network on September 1,
    2016.* Mr. Farnush is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999
    report published by the Baha i International Community. The report, Iran s
    Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community, documents
    the persecutions of the members of the Baha i faith in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran and lists the members killed since 1978. Additional
    information has been drawn from various issues of The Baha i World. See
    for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Mr. Farnush was born in 1938
    in Karaj into a Baha'i family. He completed high school in Karaj and
    studied his Bachelor of Persian Literature at Tehran University. He began
    his career as a teacher in Rasht but later returned to Karaj. Eventually,
    he founded his own business, "Bazargani Tadarok," which specialized in
    office supplies and machinery and is based in Tehran. Mr. Farnush was a
    member of the Karaj Youth Committee. In 1979, he was appointed to the
    Local Spiritual Assembly and later joined the National Committee for
    External Migration. (ABPI, bio) Sheikh Mostafa Rahnama, although not
    holding any official positions in the judiciary, the Revolutionary
    Committee, the Revolutionary Guards, or similar organizations, was known
    for persecuting Baha'is. (Sabeti, August 21, 2022) On October 19, 1980, he
    led four armed individuals in a warrantless raid on Mr. Farnush's store.
    They detained the store clerk, physically searched the staff, confiscated
    thirty thousand rials from the clerk's wallet, and seized two checks
    totaling one million rials from a customer, claiming the funds were
    "ritually unclean" as they came from a Baha'i-owned store. Rahnama
    discovered the store's warehouse address in seized documents, sealed the
    main entrance, and claimed to have discovered "ammunition and explosives"
    there. The following day, with more personnel, a van, and a truck, they
    transferred goods, machinery, and parts valued at over twelve million
    rials to an undisclosed location. In his letter to the Office of the
    Prosecutor of the Islamic Revolution of Karaj, Mr. Farnush described the
    raid on his store as violating Sharia laws and the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, He requested a prompt investigation and the return of
    his seized assets. (Mr. Farnush's letter to the Karaj Revolutionary
    Prosecutor's Office on October 22, 1980, ABPI) Prosecutor General Mousavi
    Ardebili formally acknowledged Mr. Farnush's complaint and referred it to
    the Office of the Prosecutor of the Islamic Revolution in Karaj for
    further review. He also instructed that the findings of the investigation
    should be reported to the Magistrate's Office. (The Prosecutor
    General-Mousavi Ardebili letter, October 26, 1980, ABPI) On November 1,
    1980, at 3:00 am, Rahnama and seven armed guards forcefully entered Mr.
    Farnush's sister-in-law's Gitti home without a warrant. They were
    searching for Mr. Farnush, but since he was not present, they proceeded
    with a 12-hour search of the house. They seized their passports, a power
    of attorney, and insurance documents during the search. Additionally, they
    confiscated stored food from the basement, which belonged to four
    families, including boxes of dry milk and prepared food for her sister's
    two-month-old baby. (Mr. Farnush's sister-in-law Gitti Jeddi complaint to
    the Central Committee of the Islamic Revolution of Iran on November 4,
    1980, ABPI) The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979** (Time Magazine, 1984- Baha i
    Studies,1984) to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of
    their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized
    under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities
    refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the
    rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot
    profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.*** Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
