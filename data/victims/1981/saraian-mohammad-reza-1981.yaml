    The information about the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Sarayan and 52
    other individuals was released in a communique of the Esfahan Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal, published in the newspaper, Jomhuri Eslami ,
    September 30, 1981. Mr. Sara ian (Mojahedin Khalq Iran ) is also one of
    the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention No
    information is available about defendant's arrest or detention. Trial No
    information is available about Mr. Mohammad Reza Sarayan's trial. Charges
    Mr. Sarayan was accused of "being a member of the armed wing of the
    People' s Mojahedin Organization... terror, murder and attacking the
    revolutionary guard and bassij brothers, attacking the Bassij dormitories,
    throwing Molotov cocktails and three ways [explosives] in public places,
    [aiming] cars and shops of the revolutionary guards, Bassij and the
    hezbollahi people." These charges are collective and brought against the
    defendant and 52 other individuals. The prosecution does not mention any
    specific offense for the defendant. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available about evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available about his defense. Judgment He was found guilty
    of "armed rebellion against the Islamic Republic" and sentenced to death.

    *The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of
    their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic
    Republic authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap
    between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin
    as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
    treatment by governmental officials and the government officials efforts
    to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact
    that the regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and
    Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from this
    demonstration is unknown but a large number of demonstrators were arrested
    and executed in the following days and weeks. The day after the
    demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a repressive campaign
    unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of MKO members and
    sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981, the MKO
    announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and assassinated
    a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the Islamic regime.
    In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the impeached President
    (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they founded the National
    Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many of its members were
    expelled from France, they went to Iraqand founded the National Liberation
    Army of Iran in 1987, which entered Iranian territory a
