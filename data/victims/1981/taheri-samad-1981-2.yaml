    Mr. Samad Taheri would make artwork from construction material scraps and
    tiles. He was very lively and his friends have fond memories of him. He
    liked group hiking. He had a good voice and sang Turkish and Lor songs
    very well. Mr. Samad Taheri is one of the 430 individuals whose names
    appear on the list of the Martyrs of Sazman-e Peykar dar Rah-e Azadi-e
    Tabaqe-ye Kargar ( Organization of Struggle for the Emancipation of the
    Working Class , or simply Peykar , meaning battle) on Peykar Thought s
    internet website. This is a list of the Organization s members who have
    died since the 1979 Revolution. More than 400 of the people whose names
    appear on the list have been executed. Additional information about this
    case was obtained from the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interview with
    one of Mr. Taheri s friends and cellmates, and from an electronic form
    filled out by a person with knowledge of the case and sent to the
    Boroumand Center. Mr. Samad Taheri, child of Gholamhossein, was born in
    1961-62 in the city of Zanjan, and was single. He had one brother and two
    sisters, and was the third child of the family. He was very attached to
    his family, especially to his parents, and always considered himself
    indebted to them. His family was considered lower middle class. Mr. Taheri
    was a senior (12thgrade) at Sadr-e Jahan High School in Zanjan. He worked
    as a painter and tile layer in the summertime in order to earn pocket
    money for the school year. He was an average student but was an avid
    reader. According to one of his friends, like many people his age, he had
    developed leftist tendencies through reading books. There was a newspaper
    kiosk in Zanjan s old Sabzeh Meydan which rented books for two Rials, and
    Mr. Taheri and his friends were among its regular customers. They had
    started by reading various novels and had gradually moved toward history,
    philosophy, and politics. Mr. Taheri was an artist and would make artwork
    from construction material scraps and tiles. He could also write
    beautifully in calligraphy. Mr. Taheri was a very fun and jovial person,
    loved life and was very lively. His friends have fond memories of him. He
    liked group hiking. He had a good voice and sang Turkish and Lor operas
    and songs very well. When he would go hiking with his friends, they would
    ask him to sing the Lor song Tofang ( shotgun ) which had a very pleasant
    melody. He was interested in ideological and political discussions and was
    a supporter of the Peykar Organization. Because of the oppressive
    atmosphere of the years 1981-82, he had dropped out of school to avoid
    being arrested and was working temporary jobs incognito because the
    Bassijis (militia) and the Revolutionary Guards were present on every
    street in order to identify and arrest political activists. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China
    had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed
    all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    In mid to late October 1981, as he was on his way with one of his friends
    to repair a tape recorder, Mr. Taheri was identified by a Revolutionary
    Guards patrol, arrested on a street in Zanjan, and taken to the
    Revolutionary Guards detention center. Some of the prison guards there
    were his former schoolmates. The Revolutionary Guards detention center was
    a building located at the entry to the road going toward Tehran, which was
    also called Darvazeh Tehran ( Tehran Gate ). The building was actually the
    Revolutionary Guards headquarters but Mr. Taheri and a number of other
    political prisoners were kept there temporarily because there were not
    enough prisons to hold all the arrestees. In mid to late November of that
    same year, due to the shortage of space, he and a number of other
    prisoners were transferred to a building located on the Zanjan beltway
    which had belonged to the youth scouting organization under the Shah and
    was used for students music practice and other cultural activities. After
    the Revolution, the Revolutionary Guards occupied the building and turned
    it into a prison. According to one of Mr. Taheri s ward mates, the prison
    s conditions were substandard. This was an administrative building, the
    basement of which (likely the previous archives and lacking sufficient
    light) was turned into a ward where t
