    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Jadidi, son of Mohammad, and 25
    other individuals, was published in Kayhan newspaper and Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on Saturday, October 10, 1981, quoting the communiqu of the
    Office of Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General
    s Office. The names and crimes of the accused have been stated in this
    communiqu . Mr. Jadidi is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Based on available information, Mr. Jadidi was a
    supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Jadidi s arrest and detention are unknown. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. According to the
    communiqu of the Office of Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecutor General s Office, the Esfahan Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    tried Mr. Jadidi and 25 other individuals. Charges The Office of Public
    Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office has
    stated the charges brought against Mr. Mohammad Reza Jadidi and 25 others
    as being armed action against the Islamic Republic, membership in safe
    houses, participating in the Hypocrites (derogatory term used by the
    Islamic Republic to describe the MKO) military teams, throwing hand
    grenades and Molotov cocktails, theft of motorcycles and car tags with a
    view to assassinate Sepah (Revolutionary Guards Corps) personnel, forging
    marriage and birth certificate stamps, burning automobiles belonging to
    [governmental] organs and to Moslem individuals, committed [and dedicated
    to the Islamic Republic]. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Jadidi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Jadidi's defense.
    Judgment The Esfahan Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal declared Mr. Mohammad
    Reza Jadidi Baqi ( One who has turned against Islam and Islamic Rule ) and
    Mofsed fel Arz ( One who sows corruption on Earth ) and sentenced him to
    death. The sentence was carried out on Wednesday, October 7, 1981 and he
    was shot by a firing squad in [the city of] Esfahan. Mr. Jadidi was 17
    years old. _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the s
