    Ja’farzadeh, was announced in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August 20,
    1981. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest

    defendant’s trial other than he was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Sarab (East Azarbaijan province). Charges Mr. Vakili was
    charged with “various counts of sodomy.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the

    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on his defense.

    Vakili to death. He was executed in Sarab.
