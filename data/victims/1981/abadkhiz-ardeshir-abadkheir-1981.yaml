    The news of Mr. Ardeshir Abadkheir s (Abadkhiz) execution was announced in
    a communiqu by the Bandar Anzali Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office
    published in the Jomhouri Eslami newspaper on July 15, 1981. Mr. Ardeshir
    Abadkheir, 27, university student, a native of Qaemshahr, and a member of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization is also one of the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of
    Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of
    Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the
    Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic
    and social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Abadkheir s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Mr. Abadkheir
    was tried in the Bandar Anzali Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal on July 6,
    1981. Charges According to the communiqu from Bandar Anzali Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office Mr. Abadkheir was charged with
    participating in and leading an illegal demonstration, conducting
    organizational activity in the Khomam and Some e Sara region, clashing
    with and injuring Muslim brothers with a knife, creating panic, corrupting
    young women and men of the region and guiding them towards
    counter-revolutionary activities, and destruction and breaking of doors
    and windows of shops. Evidence of guilt The Bandar Anzali Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office communiqu cited the following as
    evidence against Mr. Abadkheir: a report by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Guards Corps, field investigations and an inquiry from the devout people
    of the region, testimony of eye-witnesses, and confession of the defendant
    to acting on behalf of the Mojahedin Organization and being its leader in
    Khomam and surrounding areas. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    According to the Bandar Anzali Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office
    communiqu Mr. Abadkheir defended himself after his indictment was read in
    court. No detailed information is available on Mr. Abadkheir s defense.
    Judgment The Bandar Anzali Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal found Mr.
    Ardeshir Abadkheir guilty of waging war against God and God s Prophet,
    corruption on earth, and rebelling against the Islamic Republic. Mr.
    Abadkheir was sentenced to death, and he was executed by a firing squad on
    July 13, 1981. Mr. Abadkheir was 27 years old at the time of his
    execution. *The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the
    closure of their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the
    Islamic Republic authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened
    the gap between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the
    Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime
    attacked
