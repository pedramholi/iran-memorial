    Brilliant, people said of him, although his parents worried over his firm
    commitments. A friend recognized his voice, in prison, chanting the Qur
    an. The information about Mr. Majid Safapur, son of Iraj, has been
    collected from an interview with his brother. The public relations unit of
    the central Islamic revolutionary prosecution office announced his
    execution in a communiqu , along with his older brother Farhad and 51
    other persons. This communiqu was published in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on September 30, 1981. An individual familiar with this case has
    sent Omid further information about Mr. Safapur. Additionally, he is one
    of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 till the publication date of the magazine. Mr.
    Safapur was born in Esfahan in 1965. He was a third year high school
    student, majoring in mathematics. His brother remembers him as a brilliant
    and well-loved student. He says, Once when I was a junior high school
    student, one of the teachers came to me and whispered, I taught your
    brother. He was one of the brightest students I have ever had. Mr. Safapur
    enjoyed reading. He was a religious person; he prayed. However, the Islam
    he believed in was completely different from the Islam that officials of
    the Islamic Republic preached. Mr. Safarpur was a sympathizer of the MKO.
    He was active in the propagation department of the prganization. His
    parents were worried about the consequences of his activism. A few months
    before his arrest, they forbade him from bringing political publications
    to the house. He and his older brother Farhad moved out of the house into
    rented a room. The interviewee remembers that Mr. Safapur was very
    steadfast in his political beliefs. His parents could not convince him to
    stop his political activities. Even after he moved out, his parents
    efforts to persuade him from not be politically active remained futile.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Safapur was arrested during a demonstration on
    June 20, 1981. State officials did not notify his family of the arrest.
    His friends who also attended the demonstration informed his family. His
    parents visited the police station, on the base of the Revolutionary
    Guards Corps. Officials of these agencies told the Safapurs that they did
    not know anything about their son. The interviewee remembers that his
    mother left the house in the morning with a bag containing food and
    clothes for Mr. Safapur. Having visited different offices, she returned
    home in the evening with the same bag, unable to find her son. About one
    month before his execution, Revolutionary Guards of the Third District in
    Esfahan gave a piece of paper to Mr. Safapur s mother. He had written on
    the paper God willing, we will be soon released. The guards told his
    mother than many were arrested but were going to be released soon.
    However, they did not inform her of the location of Mr. Safapur s
    detention. Mr. Safapur had a good voice. He sang and chanted the Quran in
    prison. A friend of his, who was also arrested, heard Mr. Safapur s voice
    while in custody. Mr. Safapur was denied visitors for his entire detention
    period of more than three months. The demonstration of June 20, 1981, took
    place in protest against the Parliament s impeachment of President
    Banisadr and the Islamic Republic s systematic policy of excluding the MKO
    from the country s political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to
    meet with MKO leaders and his insistence for them to disarm. The MKO had,
    until then, supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to
    function within the framework of the new political system. On June 20, the
    organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations, in which some of the
    demonstrators were armed, all over the country. These demonstrations,
    which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of
    demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that targeted not only
    the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized as
    official government policy the months-old state harassment and suppression
    of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Trial According to the central prosecution office, Mr.
    Safapur was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Esfahan. His
    family members were unaware of this trial. The date of the trial is not
    known. Charges The central prosecution office announced that Mr. Safapur
    and 52 others, including his brother Farhad, were collectively charged
    with armed action against the Islamic Republic of Iran; te
