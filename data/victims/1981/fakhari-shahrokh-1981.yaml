    Mr. Shahrokh Fakhari (Komala) is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Several remaining members of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party of Iran established the Revolutionary Organization of
    this party in Iraq in the mid 1960s. Esma’il Sharifzadeh, Abdollah Mo’ini,
    and Molaavareh were among the leaders of this organization who, inspired
    by the Cuban Revolution, began an armed guerrilla struggle in Kurdistan.
    When this group was defeated in 1969 and several of its members were
    arrested, armed struggle was criticized and the Maoist trend overcomes.
    When some of its leaders were released in 1978, the Revolutionary
    Organization of Working People in Kurdistan – Komala was established.
    Based on Marxist theory, Komala was against the capitalists and landlords
    and encouraged workers and peasants in Kurdistan to an armed uprising
    against them and the central government. This organization considered the
    Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI) as the rich party and campaigned
    against it, resulting in several armed conflicts and hundreds dead. In
    1982, Komala joined another Marxist group, Sahand, which was basically a
    theoretical group, and established the Communist Party of Iran. Then it
    became called the Kurdistan Organization of the Communist Party of Iran –
    Komala. Years later, this organization separated from the Communist Party
    of Iran and faced several schisms. The Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan,
    led by Abdollah Mohtadi, Komala, and the Kurdistan Organization of the
    Communist Party of Iran led by Ebrahim Alizadeh are some of these
    factions. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
