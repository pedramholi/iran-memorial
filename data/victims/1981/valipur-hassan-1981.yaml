    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan Valipur, son of Hakam, along with
    another person, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on July 9, 1981. Mr.
    Hassan Valipur is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shiraz
    announced the charges against Mr. Hassan Valipur as, “participation in
    clashes of the Maoist group of Peykar, throwing four Molotov cocktails
    toward people, and attempting to escape carrying three more Molotov
    cocktails when arrested.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hassan Valipur's
    defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shiraz identified
    Mr. Hassan Valipur as "Mohareb (fighter) against God and the People, and
    Baghi (rebel)." He was condemned to death. The ruling was carried out when
    he was executed in Shiraz on July 8, 1981.
