    The information about Mr. Vahid Hematboland is based on an interview with
    his sister. He was born in 1961 and a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Majority (Left Faction). His sister remembers him as a kind young man who
    wanted freedom and happiness for the people. He majored in mathematics and
    graduated high school with very good grades. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    Revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Majority considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary
    and anti-imperialist regime and supported it. After the spring of 1983,
    however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely because of their
    political beliefs. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Vahid Hematboland left
    his house on June 23, 1981 and never returned. According to his sister,
    two of his friends came to his house and informed the family of his arrest
    the same afternoon. He was arrested as he handed out leaflets. He was held
    at the Committee on Pahlavi Street for two days and then transferred to
    Evin prison. He was held incommunicado for his entire detention period.
    State officials even denied that he was kept in Evin. Every time his
    mother went to Evin, hoping to be able to visit him, the prison officials
    insulted her and threatened that she might be arrested as well. She would
    cry and return home. Trial No information is available on the defendant s
    trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Vahid Hematboland s
    charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain

    information is available about the defendant s execution. Mr. Vahid
    Hematboland was executed in Evin prison on July 12, 1981. His sister says:
    we heard the news of his execution on the radio and read it in the
    newspapers. The same day, some officials, who claimed they came from Evin,
    told us that we were not allowed to have any burial ceremony. They buried
    him in the Khavaran cemetery and did not even return his belongings. Ms.
    Hematboland says: after the internment, we were not allowed to place a
    headstone for him. The put several of them, but each time they were
