    News of the execution of Mr. Mansur Bahramian, son of Ahmad, along with
    twelve others, was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on January 3,
    1982, quoting a communiqu by the Public Relations department of the
    Islamic Revolution s Chief Public Prosecutor. Additional information is
    based on an electronic form sent to Omid by a person familiar with his
    case. This execution was also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed
    Magazine (No. 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985.
    The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June, 1981, to the publication date of the
    magazine. According to the existing information, Mr. Mansur Bahramian was
    single and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    to be their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to a split within the Marxist-Leninist section
    of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of
    the MKO were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and to recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were primary in the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, whether by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic s
    leaders. * Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Bahramian s
    arrest and detention are not known. According to the electronic form, he
    was arrested in Takab. Trial No information is available regarding Mr.
    Bahramian s trial. According to the communiqu of the public relations
    department of the Islamic Revolution s Chief Public Prosecutor, the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Sanandaj issued the ruling against Mr.
    Bahramian. Charges According to the communiqu sent by the Public Relations
    Department of the Islamic Revolution s Chief Public Prosecutor, the
    charges against Mr. Bahramian and another person were described to have
    engaged in: armed insurrection against the Islamic Republic of Iran,
    extensive collaboration with the [Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization or MKO],
    being involved in pro-organization activities, establishing the Students
    Islamic Association in Takab, holding sessions and attracting people to
    the organization, participation in discussions in the streets which
    resulted in clashes, providing financial support for the Mujahedin Khalq
    Organization, and supporting their positions. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Bahramian. Defense No information is
    available regarding Mr. Bahramian's defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Sanandaj identified Mr. Bahramian as Mofsed
    [corruptor on earth], Mohareb [fighter against God], and Baghi [rebel]
    against the Islamic government. He was sentenced to death and executed in
    Sanandaj on December 31, 1981 at dawn. ________________________ * The
    exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of their
    centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic
    authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the
    two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites
    and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin
    sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while distributing
    publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20,
    1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by
    governmental officials and the government officials efforts to impeach
    their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the
    regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets,
