    The information about Ms. Zahra Atlaschian has been drawn from an
    electronic form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. She
    is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According
    to the available information, Ms. Atlaschian studied at the dental school
    of Esfahan University. She was affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Arrest and detention The exact circumstances of Ms.
    Atlaschian’s arrest and detention are not known, other than she was
    arrested in June 20, 1981 in the Mojahedin demonstration. During her
    detention in Esfahan prison, she was severely tortured (electronic form).
    The demonstration of June 20, 1981, took place in protest against the
    parliament’s impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic’s
    systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) from
    the country’s political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet
    with MKO leaders and his insistence for them to disarm. The MKO had until
    then supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function
    within the framework of the new political system. On June 20, the
    Organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations, in which some of the
    demonstrators were armed, all over the country. These demonstrations,
    which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of
    demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that targeted not only
    the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized as
    official government policy the months-old state harassment and suppression
    of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Trial There is no information regarding this trial.
    Charges Ms. Atlaschian was charged with “being at war with God”
    (electronic form). Evidence of guilt No information is available
    concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense No
    information is available concerning Ms. Atlaschian’s defense. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the verdict leading to this
    execution. Ms. Zahra Atlaschian died under torture at the headquarters of
    the Revolutionary Guards Corps in Esfahan.
