circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Karim Gholami, son of Ahmad, along with two other
    individuals was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on June 27, 1981. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial
    other than he was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Kermanshah. Charges There is no exact information on the personal charges
    brought against him. The news story mentions the collective charge against
    and two other individuals as “adultery, sodomy, and counter-Revolutionary
    activities.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Gholami defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Kermanshah condemned Mr. Karim Gholami to death.
    He was executed on June 25, 1981 at Dizel Abad prison.
