    The Public Relations Office of Evin Prison announced the execution of Mr.
    Hojjatollah Malek (known as Hojjat Mansur), son of Gholam Abbas, and 11
    other individuals to the Pars news agency. The news was published in the
    Kayhan and the Johuri Eslami newspapers on August 5, 1981. Mr. Malek is
    one of the 430 individuals whose name appears on the list of Martyrs of
    the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published
    on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those
    members of the Organization who died after the Revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Moreover, he
    is mentioned in the Peykar magazine (the main publication of the Peykar
    Organization), number 115 (Aug. 24, 1981), and number 121 (Oct. 5, 1981).
    Additionally, this execution was also announced in the addendum of the
    Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated
    with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes
    with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the
    publication date of the magazine. According to Peykar , he was born in
    Arak in 1955. He graduated technical high school of Arak in 1974, majoring
    in electronics. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Malek was charged with armed rebellion
    or armed action against the Islamic Republic, according to Kayhan and
    Jomhuri Eslami respectively. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on his defense. Judgment
    The Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Mr. Hojjatollah Malek
    to death. According to the Mojahed magazine, he was executed on July 12,
    1981. He was 26.
