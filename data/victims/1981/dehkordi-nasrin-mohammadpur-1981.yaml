    Evin officials tortured her so badly her feet swelled like cushions. Yet
    she did not confess one word even her real name News of the execution of
    Ms. Nasrin Mohammadpur Dehkordi, daughter of Alimorad, has been taken from
    two electronic forms submitted by way of the ABF website (May 8, 2014 and
    May 10, 2017) as well as from an interview conducted with a person close
    to Dekhordi (July 12, 2014). Friends of Dekhordi have confirmed news of
    her execution in their own writings, as well (Mina Zarin, March 17, 2014).
    Her name also appears on lists of killed Fadaiyan members (Fedaiyan list,
    1971-2012). In prison, Dekhordi used the name "Nahid Mohammadi the name
    under which she was also executed. According to the existing information,
    Dehkordi was born in Shahr-e Kord, Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari province, in
    1959. She was single and a student at Tehran s National University
    majoring in economics. She began her political activism in 1977, joining
    the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Minority). Prior to her arrest, Dekhordi
    was active in the organization s labor division. According to an
    individual formerly imprisoned in the same ward as Dekhordi, she was a
    beautiful, cheerful, witty person with a fine sense of humor and striking
    eyes. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired
    by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America,
    was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    In 1981, the organization, which had opted for open political and
    electoral activity after the revolution, split over the critique of the
    concept of urban guerilla warfare and the support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic
    Republic, and though it did not abandon the theory of armed struggle, its
    activities were mainly limited to the political arena and the labor
    movement. Following the Mojahedin Khalq Organization s June 21st
    declaration of armed struggle, the Fadaiyan announced the organization of
    combatant cells. However, based on available information, these cells did
    not become operational. Many of the groups members and supporters were
    arrested and executed in the early 1980 s. Arrest and detention Ms.
    Mohammadpur Dehkordi was arrested along with a comrade while leaving
    Tehran for Karaj on November 30, 1981. One of her comrades called and
    informed her family of her arrest (electronic form). She was detained at
    Evin Prison for 20 days and interrogated and tortured at Evin s sixth
    prosecutorial branch (publication of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization
    Minority). She spent one to two days in the ward alongside other
    prisoners. She was tortured severely with a cable: interrogators beat her
    feet so badly that they swelled up like pillows (Mina Zarin). Despite the
    severe torture, Dehkordi kept up good spirits. She gave the interrogators
    no information, including her real name. During her attention, she was
    denied meetings with family. Her mother travelled every day to Evin, but
    was not able to see her child; she was also harassed and intimidated by
    prison officialls repeatedly. Trial No information is available on Ms.
    Mohammadpur Dehkordi s trial. According to a cellmate, she was not tried.
    Dehkordi was denied access to a lawyer. Charges No information is
    available on Ms. Mohammadpur Dehkordi s charges. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Ms. Mohammadpur Dehkordi. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    The stages of Dekhordi s detention and interrogation took only 20 days.
    During this time, she defended her organization s positions (publication
    of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization Minority). No precise information is
    available regarding her legal defense, however. Judgment Ms. Nasrin
    Mohammadpur Dehkordi was killed by firing squad in Evin Prison along with
    one other person on December 21, 1980. Her cellmate recalled: She was in
    excellent spirits. She would laugh and lift our morale in spite of daily
    torture so bad that she could not put her injured feet on the ground. Her
    laughter was unforgettable, and I won t forget the moment she was taken to
    be executed. She held her head up, tidied her hair, put on her blue suit
    and skirt, and tried hard to stand up straigt. In the hallway she cried
    out: Execute us, but you cannot change history . Don t be sad Cherish the
    beautiful things in life Dekhordi wrote her parents the day of her
    execution. Another of Dehkordi s fellow prisoners reports that One rainy
    spring afternoon, Nahid Mohammadi (the name
