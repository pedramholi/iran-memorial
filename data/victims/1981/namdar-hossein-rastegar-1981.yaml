    Information about Mr. Hossein Rastegar Namdar (also spelled " Husayn
    Rastigar-Namdar") , son of Mirza Masih Taleqani, was sent to Boroumand
    Foundation (ABF) via two electronic forms by people who knew him. Mr.
    Rastegar is also one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999 report
    published by the Baha i International Community. The report, Iran s Secret
    Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community, documents the
    persecutions of the members of the faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran
    and lists the Baha is killed since 1978. Further information has been
    drawn from various issues of the World Baha i volumes. Additional
    information about Mr. Rastegar was taken from a facebook page named
    memoirs of a Baha i prisoner and from the Vaselan website. Mr. Rastegar
    Namdar, a husband and father of two, was born in 1916. He was a proficient
    speaker and writer who loved art. He graduated from the military college
    as a Lieutenant and obtained his law degree from Tehran University. Mr.
    Rastegar was a lieutenant general of the ground forces and commander of
    the logistical forces of the military during the last years of his
    service. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979*- to systematic harassment and
    persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The
    Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic
    Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result,
    the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status of a
    religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are
    banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice
    has subjected them to abuse and violence.** Persecution of Baha is in Iran
    is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era
    that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself,
    supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and
    in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from
    France to Iran, in response to a question regarding political and
    religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government,
    Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they are harmful
    and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked
    another question: Will they be free to perform their religious rites? The
    Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i
    threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national security
    in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention
    Mr. Rastegar Namdar was arrested in September 1980 and spent 11 months in
    detention. No further details are available on his arrest and detention.
    Trial There is no specific information on the defendant s trial. Charges
    The charge against Mr. Rastegar was his belief in Baha i religion.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available on the evidence presented
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rastegar
    Namdar's defense. However, the representatives of the Baha'i community
    stress that their members are being persecuted for their religious
    beliefs. They note that Baha'is' requests to access their files are
    usually denied and that, even though they are allowed to avail themselves
    of the services of a defense counsel since the mid-1990s, attorneys are
    often under pressure not to accept Baha'i clients. They refute the
    validity of charges, such as counter-revolutionary political activities or
    spying, leveled against them in Iranian courts. They point out that the
    fundamental principles of their religion require them to show loyalty and
    obedience to their government and refrain from any political involvement.
    They believe that the accusation of espionage for Israel is unfounded and
    based solely on the fact that the Baha'i World Centre is in Israel. They
    point out that this center was established on Mount Carmel in the late
    19thcentury, long before the establishment of the State of Israel.
    Judgment The sentence was issued on August 5, 1981, by a religious judge.
    According to one of his cellmates, knowing nothing about his sentence, Mr.
    Rastegar was watching T.V. with his cellmates at 6 p.m. on August 5, when
    he heard the news of his execution on TV. Hearing the news, he said
    goodbye to his friends and said, All right, I have so far been neither
    Rastegar (had no salvation) nor Namdar (well-known) , but just became
    both. Mr. Rastegar s body was delivered to his cousin s wife and buried in
    the Golestan Javid (Baha i cemetery) in Tehran.
