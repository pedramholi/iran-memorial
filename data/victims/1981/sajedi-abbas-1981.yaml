    News of the execution of Mr. Abbas Sajedi, son of Abolhassan, was sent to
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation via an electronic form by his sister
    on October 5, 2016. He is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Mr. Sajedi was born in Bandar-e Anzali. He was
    single, a high school graduate, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. He was a kind and popular person who helped others. For
    example, he built a house for two elderly neighbors. His activities in the
    organization included selling publications and collecting financial
    support. He also participated in the organizational gatherings. For these
    activities, he was wanted by the Islamic Republic agents by September of
    1980. His brother was executed in Bandar-e Anzali on October 20, 1981. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention Mr. Sajedi was arrested by Revolutionary
    Guards, without a warrant, in a street in Bandar-e Anzali on August 20,
    1981. He was transferred to the Anzali Prison with tied hand and foot. He
    was detained for 11 days and had two visitations. The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Bandar-e Anzali tried Mr. Sajedi. No information is available on his
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Sajedi was sympathy with the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Sajedi. However, he was well-known as a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in Bandar-e Anzali. Defense Mr. Sajedi was denied access to
    an attorney. No information is available on his defense. Judgment Mr.
    Abbas Sajedi was executed by firing squad in Bandar-e Anzali on August 30,
    1981. His body was buried at the Bandar-e Anzali cemetery. His mother had
    seen marks of wounds and torture on her son s body.
    _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the authorities called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
