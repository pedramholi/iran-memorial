    The execution of Mr. Ruhollah Baqervand and 14 other individuals was
    announced in the Kayhan newspaper, on July 22, 1981. Public Relations
    department of the Public Prosecution Office released the names and charges
    of the convicted individuals to the media. Mr. Baqeri is one of the 430
    individuals whose name appears on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those members
    of the Organization who died after the Revolution of 1979. This execution
    was also reported in the addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No. 261, August
    1985, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The Public Prosecution Offices did not release the charges brought
    against Mr. Ruhollah Baqervand to the media. Evidence of guilt The report
    of this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Baqervand’s defense. Judgment In accordance with the verdict of the
    Revolutionary Tribunal, Mr. Ruhollah Baqervand was executed by a firing
    squad at Evin Prison in Tehran on July 22, 1981. No information is
    available on the judgment but the bodies of the executed individuals were
    transferred to the forensic team.
