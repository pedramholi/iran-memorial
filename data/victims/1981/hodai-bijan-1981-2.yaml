    Bijan read precociously as a boy, auditing elementary school classes
    before they d let him officially enroll. His manners were gentle as he
    grew into active, passionate, Iranian politics. Information about Mr.
    Bijan Hoda i, son of Hassan, has been drawn from an interview with his
    brother. He is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No. 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Additionally, his name is mentioned in the list of Martyrs of
    the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class, published
    on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. The execution of Mr. Hoda i and 29
    other persons was announced in the communiqu of the Public Relations
    Department of the Prosecution s Office of Tehran Province and published in
    the Kayhan newspaper on December 1, 1981. Mr. Hoda i was born into a
    political family. Until the coup of August 19, 1953, his parents were
    affiliated with the Tudeh Party. However, his mother continued her
    political activism secretly, even after the coup. Bijan spent his
    childhood and adolescence in Abadan. From childhood, his parents knew that
    he was very intelligent. He could read from the age of 5 and went to
    school. However, according to the regulations of the Ministry of
    Education, 7 was the age that children could go to school. Therefore,
    Bijan audited classes until he came of age, and he was among the best
    students. When he was a high school student, his family moved to Tehran,
    where he went to the Kharazmi High School. As a high school student, Bijan
    started to show interest in politics. He joined book clubs and tutored
    students at another high school in west Tehran. He also formed reading
    groups with his students. In 1977, he passed the university entrance exam
    with very good scores and was admitted to study electronics. After
    enrollment in the university, he started his political activism, which
    resulted in his discharge from school. The following year, he passed the
    university entrance exam and was again admitted to study electronics at
    Tehran University. After the revolution of 1979, he was one of the
    organizers of student political activists, working for an organization
    that sympathized with Khat-e Se (the Third Line). Later, Mr. Hoda i was a
    sympathizer of the Peykar Organization and in charge of the activities of
    high school and university students. Despite his gentle manners, Bijan was
    very active and passionate in his political activism. His sister, Ms.
    Manijeh Hoda i, and her husband, Mr. Mas ud Jigare i were also executed
    The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar also joined
    with a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (the Third
    Line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla
    struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian
    Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state,
    believed that China had deviated from Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention Mr. Hoda i s date of arrest is not known.
    He was forced to go underground in the summer of 1981, when the oppression
    of political activists intensified, for he was a well-known leftist
    student. Though he lived underground, he made regular phone calls to his
    mother to let her know he was fine. From early fall 1981, he no longer
    called. His family members were not informed about his arrest but believe
    that he was arrested in early fall. Individuals who knew Bijan informed
    them that he had been arrested in Tehran during an organizational meeting.
    Trial Mr. Hoda i was tried at one of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals
    of Tehran Province. There is no other information regarding his trial.
    Charges According to the communiqu of the Public Relations Department of
    the Prosecution s Office of Tehran Province, Mr. Hoda i was charged with
    sympathizing with the American organization Peykar and participation in
    armed demonstrations opposing the regime of the Islamic Republic. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence
    presented against the accused. Defense No information is available
    concerning Mr. Hoda i s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Tehr
