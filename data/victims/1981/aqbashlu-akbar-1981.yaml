    The news about execution of Mr. Aqbashlu was announced by the public
    relations office of prosecutor general for the central branch of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court and was published in Jomhouri Eslami newspaper
    on August 30, 1981. The press release reads as follows: In the name of
    God, O ye who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to
    people. [sic] Hail to the warriors who are at the front of the war against
    global heresy led by the bloodthirsty America, and hail to the heroic and
    the martyr-cultivating Umma that diminishes the space for the heartless
    and criminal Monafeqin (hypocrites) at the inner fronts. Every day, Umma
    arrests another group of these anti-Quran and anti-Islam criminals and
    turns them to the security forces and the judiciary. Every day the Umma
    responds to Quran s calling that says O Prophet, fight against the
    disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them. Mr. Aqbashlu s
    wife, Ms. Ladan Bayani, was executed at the same time with him. His his
    borther, Mr. Babak Aqabashlu, was executed a month later.* Mr. Aqbashlu s
    name is among the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    Boroumand Foundation received additional information about Mr. Aqbashlu
    through an electronic form sent by a person familiar with this case.
    According to this information, Mr. Aqbashlu, son of Ali, was born in
    Tabriz in 1955. He was married and had a Bachelor s degree in physics and
    a Master s degree in English translation. He began his political
    activities in high school and was imprisoned for a year during the Shah s
    regime because of an essay that he wrote in school. During the revolution,
    Mr. Aqbashlu, under the pseudonym Ayub, was an active member of the Peykar
    Organization. In 1980, Mr. Aqbashlu and some others split from Peykar
    Organization and founded another group called Red Star. Mr. Aqbashlu,
    under the pseudonym Amir Sabzevari, was the leader of the Red Star and the
    chief editor of its publication. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The Red Star group ( Setareh-ye
    Sorkh ), was created by a number of individuals who split from Peykar in
    1980 over tactical disagreements. The group was opposed to the Islamic
    Republic regime, rejected armed struggle, and believed in the fundamental
    role of organizing the industrial and agricultural labor force, and the
    student movement. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government in 1981 caused the dismantling of the Red Star. Arrest and
    detention According to the information sent through the electronic form,
    Mr. Aqbashlu was arrested, along with his wife, Ms. Ladan Bayani, in a
    safe house in Shahr-Ara street in Tehran on June 28, 1981. The
    Revolutionary Guards had surrounded the safe house and began shooting,
    during which Mr. Aqbashlu was shot in the leg. His family had no news of
    his whereabouts and there was no visitation. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Aqbashlu s trial. Charges According to the press release
    by the public relations office of prosecutor general for the central
    branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Court, published in Jomhouri Eslami
    newspaper on October 21, 1981, Mr. Aqbashlu was charged with membership in
    a safe house, being responsible for the Red Star publication, being
    corrupt on earth, being rebellious against Emam , waging war against God,
    and for plotting and armed opposition against the Islamic Revolution . The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this accused cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the accused. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Aqbashlu s defense. Judgment According

    his family. The family was told that he was buried in the Khavaran
