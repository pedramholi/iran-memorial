    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center was informed of the news of the execution of
    Mr. Manucher Nejati, son of Robabeh and Ali, through different sources
    such as an interview with one of his acquaintances (April 8, 2018), the
    special electronic form that was filled and sent to the Center (March 16,
    2017), as well as various documents pertaining to the Nejati family s
    lawsuits against individuals who had a role in abducting their son,
    including a letter from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of
    Kermanshah (September 2, 1981) and evidence of Mr. Nejati s death. The
    information on the group and the individuals who abducted Mr. Nejati was
    obtained from the websites of Bidaran and Fars News Agency (September 23,
    2010) and Kayhan daily (October 3, 2010). Mr. Nejati, the youngest son of
    his family, was born in Kermanshah in 1963. He was a bachelor and a
    second-year high school student in mathematics and physics. His family
    members and friends describe him as kind, smart, studious, calm, bright,
    and virtuous. His had a good relationship with his family and others, and
    he was not the kind of person to want to make trouble for anyone. Mr.
    Nejati was fond of music and mathematics (ABC interview). According to the
    available information, Mr. Nejati was active in the student section of
    Paykar Organization (DD). His activities included writing graffiti,
    distributing announcements, selling the organization s periodicals, and
    holding political sessions. Mr. Nejati had once been arrested before his
    1981 arrest, and was released upon giving a written pledge that he would
    not continue his political activities. He was 17 when he was arrested (ABC
    interview). International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment
    for those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing a crime.
    As a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and
    the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation not to
    impose capital punishment for an offence committed before the age of
    eighteen. Mr. Nejati s Death According to the available information, Mr.
    Nejati was abducted in Kermanshah on the morning of July 11, 1981 by four
    well-known members of the Shayth Group and was taken out of the city. They
    took Mr. Nejati to the Tang-e Kenesht area in the Taagh-e Bostan Mountains
    and beat him there. There was no news of him after the abduction, and he
    never returned. According to the available information, on the day of the
    incident Mr. Nejati left his home in the Sixth Bahman neighborhood of
    Kermanshah County at 6 AM along with a friend to write graffiti. He was
    identified by four members of the Shayth Group near Si-Metri Square, and
    was stopped and investigated. The Shayth Group members wanted to arrest
    Mr. Nejati and his friend after the investigation, but they escaped.
    However, they were trapped in a dead-end alley. The four Shayth Group
    members put them on two motorbikes and took them out of town. Along the
    way, the bike carrying Mr. Nejati s friend broke down and had to stop,
    while the bike carrying Mr. Nejati continued on its way towards the
    Taagh-e Bostan area outside the city. When Mr. Nejati s friend reached the
    locale later, he saw that Mr. Nejati was bloody and close to death while
    the Shayth Group members were beating him. Mr. Nejati s friend himself was
    then also beaten. The Shayth Group members told Mr. Nejati s friend that
    they intended to kill Mr. Nejati but he was free to go. However, they
    threatened him that if he told anyone about what had happened, they would
    find and kill him as well. He refused to leave and said that he would
    remain there until they freed Manuchehr as well. The Shayth Group members
    shot two bullets towards him, and he escaped fearful of being hit. On the
    same day, in a state of shock, he went to Mr. Nejati s home and informed
    his family of what had happened to their son (from the text of the
    complaint of Mr. Nejati s mother against one of the abductors, dated July
    11, 1981). The Reactions of the Authorities According to the statements of
    the official authorities, the accused had no connection with the
    Revolutionary Guards; neither had he been a member of the Komiteh Corps of
    the Revolutionary Guards. He had collaborated with the Komiteh, however.
    He was also related to the leadership of the Kermanshah Ansar-e Hezbollah
    organization (letter by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps). The
    Reactions of the Family The family of Mr. Nejati contacted the authorities
    after the disappearance of their son, but none were responsive to them.
    Mr. Nejati s mother filed a complaint against one of the individuals who
    had arrested his son at Branch 4 of the provincial Ministry of Justice
    office of Kermanshah. The court rejected the complaint for arrest and
    investigation of the individual. The individual used to be Mr. Nejati s
    classmate and had had disputes with him in school. Although this
    individual was eventually summoned to court twice, he did not receive a
    verdict from the authorities.
