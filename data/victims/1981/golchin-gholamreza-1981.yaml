    News of the execution of Mr. Gholamreza Golchin, son of Ali, along with 34
    others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on September 28, 1981. The
    Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor s Office
    announced these executions, the defendants' names and their charges, and
    released it to the Pars news agency. Mr. Gholamreza Golchin is one of the
    430 individuals whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr.
    Gholamreza Golchin is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Gholamreza Golchin were announced as, "possession of
    weapons and explosives, uprising against the Islamic Republic, belief in
    armed combat against the Islamic Republic, and participation in plotting
    assassinations and explosions." These charges were collective for five
    sympathizers of Peykar. These defendants were also charged for activity in
    an American group. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Gholamreza Golchin's
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz condemned Mr.
    Gholamreza Golchin to death. The exact date of execution is not clear. The
    statement of the Revolutionary Tribunals said the ruling was carried out
    in Tabriz between September 23 to 25, 1981. No specific information is
    available about this execution, whereas the victims lists by Peykar and
    Mojahedin Khalq Organizations declared it as September 27.
