    The information about the execution of Mr. Habibollah Ashuri, a follower
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, and 80 other individuals was released
    in a communiqué of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal, published
    in the newspaper Kayhan , September 20, 1981. Mr. Ashuri is also one of
    the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were either
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Further
    information regarding Mr. Habibollah Ashuri is taken from the website of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He was born in a village in Gonabad and
    finished his clerical education in the Mashhad Clergy School (Hozeh
    Elmieh). In addition, he studied history, philosophy, and social sciences
    while distancing himself from traditional clergymen, and was thus
    criticized harshly by some of them. He joined the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1971 and was an opponent of the previous regime. He was
    imprisoned several times and exiled once during the previous regime.
    Arrest and detention According to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization’s
    website, on November 2, 1980, Mr. Habibollah Ashuri was running an errand
    near the Parliament and was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards by the
    order of the Public Prosecutor’s Office. He was sent off to the Evin
    prison. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges There are no specific charges mentioned by the Public Prosecutor’s
    communiqué for Mr. Ashuri. The Kayhan newspaper mentions that all 81
    defendants were charged with “anti-Islamic activities.” Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ashuri's defense.
    Judgment No specific information is available about this execution. Mr.
    Habibollah Ashuri was executed by a firing squad along with some other
    sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in the Evin prison on
    September 18, 1981.
