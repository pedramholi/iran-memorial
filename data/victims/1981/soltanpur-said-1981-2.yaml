    Mr. Sa’id Soltanpur is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with Islamic Republic security forces from June, 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Further information about Mr.
    Soltanpur is based on an interview with one of his close friends, as well
    as the Mojahedin Organization’s website, the Arash magazine (No 77 and
    84), and the Central Public Prosecutor’s communiqué published in the
    Kayhan newspaper dated June 22, 1981. Mr. Soltanpur was born in Sabzevar.
    After graduating from high school, he started at a school in the southern
    Tehran. He graduated from Tehran University majoring in Fine Arts. He was
    a poet, writer, and play director. Mr. Soltanpur was a sympathizer of the
    Fadayian Khalq Organization-Aqaliat (Minority). He became politically
    active during the 1960s. He was very critical of the previous regime in
    his books and plays. Thus, most of his books and plays were banned. In
    1968, he published a poetry book named Sedaye Mira ( The Dying Voice ). He
    also directed several plays such as “Three Sisters” by Anton Chekhov and
    “The Petit Bourgeoisie” by Maxim Gorky. In 1972, he was arrested for the
    publication of a book titled A Kind of Art, A Kind of Thought and was
    released 45 days later. He was arrested again and released in 1977 when he
    joined the “Iranian Writers Association”. He was a well known face among
    “the Committed” artists. After the Revolution, in 1979, he became a
    parliamentary candidate for the Fadayian Khalq Organization-Aqaliat
    (Minority). Mr. Sa’id Soltanpur continued his artistic activities until
    his arrest. The last play he directed was called Abas Aqa, Iran’s National
    Worker . The play met with great success. The Fadayian Khalq Organization,
    a Marxist-Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadayian Khalq
    Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was mainly active in the
    political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention Mr. Soltanpur
    was arrested by Kuyekan’s Revolutionary Guards on his wedding night, April
    16, 1981. According to his wife’s statement in the Arash magazine (No 84),
    on this day, two Guards went to his house to take him in for questioning
    about some money smuggling charges. But they were denied access to the
    house. Later, before the guests arrived for the wedding, armed men
    returned and their numbers increased until they filled the yard, the
    basement, and the neighbor’s house. She wrote: “The Revolutionary Guards
    agreed to wait until the ceremony was over to take Sa’id for a couple of
    hours of questioning. They said, they would bring him back afterwards.
    When it was time for the arrest, there was a commotion and shots were
    fired in the air.” Mr. Soltanpur spent two months in detention. He was
    kept in section 209 of the Evin prison. He denied access to an attorney.
    Based on his wife’s account in the Arash magazine (No 84), he had two
    visits with his mother. According to the interviewee, during the
    interrogation, officials demanded that Mr. Soltanpur write a letter of
    repentance and participate in a TV interview, both of which he refused.
    The Arash magazine and the Mojahedin Organization’s website both mention
    that Mr. Soltanpur was severely tortured. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. The court was convened on June 21,
    1981. Charges According to the Public Prosecutor’s communiqué, Mr.
    Soltanpur was charged with “having a criminal record, smuggling money,
    being a member of the Fadayian Khalq Organization.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Soltanpur's defense.
    Judgment No details are available concerning the defendant’s death
    sentence. According to the announcement published by the Office of Public
    Affairs of the Central Revolutionary Public Prosecution, “after the trial
    and deliberation, the Revolutionary Court of the Islamic Republic
    condemned some of the criminals to death because it was required by
    religious laws and principles. They are considered Mohareb (fighters)
    against God and the Prophet.” According to the Kayhan newspaper, Mr.
    Soltanpur was executed in Evin prison on June 21, 1981 in the afternoon.
