    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Jamshidi, son of Ali, along with
    three others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on September 22, 1981.
    The identity and charges against the defendant were announced by the
    Public Relations Department of the Central Prosecution Office. Mr.
    Jamshidi is one of the 430 “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va
    Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the organization
    who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on
    this list have been executed. Additionally, his name is mentioned among
    the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985.
    The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups,
    who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic
    security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    Mr. Jamshidi studied law at the National University and was one of the
    leaders of the Peykar Student Organization in Hamedan. The statement of
    the Prosecution Office begins with this verse of the Quran, “And fight
    against them until there is no more oppression and all worship is devoted
    to God alone” [VIII: 39]. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the trial. Charges Mr. Jamshidi and
    three others were collectively charged with “plotting and action against
    the Islamic Republic Regime, participation in street fighting, member of a
    dependant group and approval of its policy of armed struggle in order to
    overthrow the Islamic regime, distribution of illegal publications, and
    misleading the youth.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Jamshidi’s defense.
    Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Hamadan called Mr. Jamshidi
    “at war with God, a corruptor on earth, and a rebel against the Islamic
    regime.” He was condemned to death and executed in Hamadan on September
    21, 1981. He was 23.
