    The execution of Mr. Ya’qub Yazdani and another individual was announced
    in the Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on July 8, 1981. Additional
    information about him has been sent to Omid via an electronic form by an
    individual familiar with this case. This execution was also reported in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. According to the form, he used to be a school
    teacher, employed by the Ministry of Education and later dismissed from
    his job. Regarding his political affiliation, the newspapers announced Mr.
    Yazdani to be a member of the Minority branch of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization and he was executed as such; however, the sender of the
    electronic form stated that he was, in fact, affiliated with the Majority
    branch of this Organization. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over the support
    to the Islamic Republic and to the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was mainly active in the
    political arena and the labor movement. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority
    considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist
    regime and supported it. It shared the views of the Tudeh Party and
    collaborated with the government. By 1983, however, its political beliefs
    made its supporters the target of the Islamic Republic’s repression.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Yazdani was arrested at 5 p.m. on June 28, 1981
    on the street where the Revolutionary Guards Corps of Behshahr base
    (Mazandaran province) was located. He was beaten and injured in the
    process. He was detained at the Revolutionary Guards base incommunicado, 6
    days in the public section, and one day in solitary confinement in an
    under-construction bathroom (electronic form). Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial other than it took place at the
    Behshahr Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal on July 6, 1981. Charges According
    to the Kayhan and the Jomhuri Eslaminewspapers, Mr. Yazdani’s was charged
    with “playing an active role against the Islamic Revolution by trying to
    divert the minds of Muslim people toward Marxism, as well as being an
    active leader of leftist groups in Behshahr, possessing a big sword and
    illegal publications that were found in his house, being responsible for
    martyring 15 people including educators, Revolutionary Guards, and the
    governor of Yanehsar district during his involvement in armed clashes with
    the people.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the form, a number of
    witnesses, who were affiliated with the government, testified against him.
    Based on the Kayhan and the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper reports, Mr. Yazdani
    “confessed to being a member of the Fadayian Khalq Organization
    (minority).” International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Yazdani’s defense. The sender of the
    form stated that the testimonies against Mr. Yazdani were false. This
    individual also noted that he did not plead guilty to the charge since he
    was a member of the Majority branch of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization,
    which supported the Islamic Republic with the right to criticize it.
    Judgment The Revolutionary Court of Behshahr declared Mr. Ya’qub Yazdani a
    “corruptor on Earth” and an “innate apostate,” and condemned him to death.
    He was executed by a firing squad on July 7, 1981, one day after the court
    issued its verdict. The Kayhan and the Jomhuri Eslami newspapers reported
    that because of being an apostate, his body was denied burial in the
    Muslim cemetery.
