    The news of the execution of Mr. Farhad Javadi was announced by a Behshahr
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office communiqué published in Jomhouri
    Eslami newspaper on August 6, 1981. According to this communiqué Mr.
    Javadi was executed along with two other Mojahedin Khalq supporters named
    Ferdos Seraj and Esfandiar Kamran. In addition, another communiqué from
    the Behshahr Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office published in
    Ettela’at on July 16, 1981 announced that the trial for Mr. Javadi and
    three other defendants were to be held on that date. Mr. Javadi (teacher,
    Mojahedin Khalq) is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with Islamic Republic security forces from June, 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of
    Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members’ interpretation
    of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the
    Shah’s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic
    and social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization’s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Javadi’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial A Behshahr
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office communiqué published in
    Ettela’at on July 16, 1981 announced that the trial for Mr. Javadi and
    three other defendants will be held on that date. No other information is
    available on Mr. Javadi’s trial. Charges The Behshahr Public Prosecutor’s
    Office communiqué lists the charges leveled against Mr. Javdi and two
    other defendants as follows: “Actively opposing the Islamic Revolution in
    a leadership position in support of the Hypocrites Organization, which has
    declared an armed struggle and rebelled against the Islamic Republic,
    terrorized [the public] through repeated street clashes, and caused injury
    to several people.” The Behshahr Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office
    communiqué did not mention any charges specific to Mr. Javadi and did not
    provide any information on the date and location of the above mentioned
    clashes. Evidence of guilt A Behshahr Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s
    Office communiqué published in Ettela’at on July 16, 1981 asked potential
    plaintiffs and witnesses to present the information they have to the
    Behshahr Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. The report of this execution,
    however, does not include any information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Javadi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Javadi’s
    defense. Judgment The Behshahr Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal found Mr.
    Javadi guilty of waging war against God, rebelling against the Islamic
    government and corruption on earth and sentenced him to death. He was
    executed by a firing squad on August 4, 1981. He was 24 at the time of his
    execution.
    ________________________________________________________________________
    *The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of
    their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic
    Republic authorities’ different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap
    between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin
    as “Hypocrites” and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
    treatment by governmental officials and the government officials’ efforts
    to impeach their ally,
