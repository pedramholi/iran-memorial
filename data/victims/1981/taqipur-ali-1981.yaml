    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Taqipur, son of Sha’ban, along with six
    others, was published in the Etela’at newspaper on July 4, 1981, and in
    the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on July 5, 1981. The Public Relations Office
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Babol announced these executions,
    the defendants' names and their charges, and released this to the media.
    Mr. Ali Taqipur is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. According to this source, Mr. Ali
    Taqipur was a single worker and a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Guerilla Organization. The Fadaiyan Khalq Guerilla Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. A number of the
    Organization’s members, who did not renounce armed struggle, founded the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Guerillas (Ashraf Dehqan Branch). Arrest and detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention.
    Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Babol tried Mr. Ali Taqipur. No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Ali Taqipur were announced as, “active participation in
    several clashes and attacking the Revolutionary Guards and the Moslem
    people of the town with an army bayonet.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against the defendants. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ali Taqipur's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Babol identified Mr. Ali Taqipur as
    "anti-revolutionary, Mofsed (corruptor on Earth), and Mohareb (fighter)
    against God." He was condemned to death. The ruling was carried out when
    he was executed by firing squad in the Islamic Revolutionary Court yard of
    Babol on July 1, 1981 at noon. No specific information is available about
    the defendant’s execution. Mr. Ali Taqipur was 27 years old.
