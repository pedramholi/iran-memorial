    The information about Mr. Yousef Yousefi is based on an electronic form
    sent to Omid by a person familiar with his case. News of his prosecution
    and execution was published in the Ettela at newspaper on August 30, 1981.
    Additional information was taken from a book titled Defying the Iranian
    Revolution written in English by Manuchehr Ganji in 2003. Mr. Yousef
    Yousefi is among the 282 individuals listed in a United Nations Report on
    The Situation of Human Right in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Note by the
    Secretary General), published on 13 November 1985. The report lists these
    individuals as "Persons who were allegedly summarily and arbitrarily
    executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran: 1984-1985." According to the
    information sent to the Boroumand Foundation, Mr. Yousef Yousefi, son of
    Mohammad ali, was born in Shahreza on November 1, 1957. After completing
    high school in 1976, he moved to Texas, USA, to continue his education. He
    was active in the Iranian Students Association and continued his
    activities against the Shah s regime after returning to Iran during the
    revolution. His activities included organizing demonstrations and
    publishing anti-establishment literature before and after the revolution.
    He also supported the Progressive Professors Association actively. In the
    fall of 1979, he was arrested, along with several other students, during a
    demonstration. However, he was released a week later. He continued his
    activities until he was arrested for the second time during another
    demonstration. He had had heart disease since childhood. During his
    detention period, he was able to visit his doctor, a member of the
    Progressive Professors Association, who arranged his transfer to the
    hospital and his escape afterwards. Mr. Yousefi, a sympathizer of the
    Vahdat-e Komonisti Organization, continued his political activities. The
    Vahdat-e Komonisti (Communist Unity) Organization was founded in November
    1978 by Communist political activists, particularly students who had been
    educated outside the country and returned to Iran, as well as
    similar-minded activists inside the country. The history of its founding
    dates back to the Ettehadieh Komonist-ha (Communist Union), which was
    formed outsideIranin the late 1960 s. The members of Vahdat-e Komonisti
    identified themselves as supporters of political-military struggle for the
    preparation and accomplishment of a socialist revolution, and as leftists
    opposed to Stalinism and Maoism. Among the activities of this organization
    were critiques of the political and ideological standpoints of political
    organizations in Iran via publication of Raha i, the main publication of
    the Vahdat-e Komonisti. During the massive crackdown on opposition groups
    in June 1981, the organization faced significant crises and split into
    various factions. Members of the organization outside Iran continued their
    activism until 1986 through the publication of Andisheh Raha i and
    Bultan-e Akhbar-e Iran (the Bulletin of Iranian News). Arrest and
    detention According to the information sent to Omid, Mr. Yousefi was
    arrested by the Revolutionary Guards at the Bus Terminal in Esfahan when
    he arrived from Tehran on June 21, 1981, a day after widespread
    demonstrations in many cities.* Apparently, his arrest was based on
    suspicion only; however, he had some anti-government written materials
    with him. Authorities did not inform his family. The family was able to
    discover his detention location after a month of intense searching. A
    month later, his brother and his mother were allowed to visit Mr. Yousefi
    for five minutes. During this visitation, he appeared with shaved head and
    it was apparent that he lost a lot of weight. With his gesture, Mr.
    Yousefi conveyed that he was beaten. He was detained less than three
    months. Trial According to the Ettela at newspaper, quoting the Public
    Relations Office of the General Public Prosecutor s Office, the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Esfahan tried Mr. Yousefi. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges According to the Ettela at newspaper, the
    charges against Mr. Yousefi were announced as, Armed rebellion against the
    Islamic Republic regime, creating fear and intimidation among the public
    in Esfahan, and participation in anti-public clashes and demonstrations in
    Esfahan. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Yousefi.
    Defense No information is available about Mr. Yousefi s defense. Judgment
    According to the Ettela at newspaper, Mr. Yousef Yousefi was executed
    along with three others in Esfahan on August 29, 1981. His family believe
    that he was probably tortured to death. They heard the news from the state
    radio. When the family went to the morgue to receive Mr. Yousefi s body,
    marks of torture were apparent on his body. These marks included
