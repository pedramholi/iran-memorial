    The news of the execution of Mr. Alireza Ratebi and 13 other individuals
    was announced by a communiqu from the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s
    Office published in Kayhan and Jomhouri Eslami on August 25, 1981. In this
    communiqu the executed individuals are referred to as hacks of the
    criminal U.S. imperialism. Mr. Ratebi, a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded
    in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Ratebi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Based on the
    available information, the Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal issued
    Mr. Ratebi s sentence. No information is available on Mr. Ratebi s trial.
    Charges According to the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office
    communiqu Mr. Ratebi and 13 other individuals were charged with rebellion
    against the Islamic Republic. In addition this communiqu announced the
    following charges against Mr. Ratebi and two other individuals: Membership
    in the armed wing of school and university students in the provinces,
    being responsible for providing necessities for individuals living in safe
    houses, involvement in more than thirty destructive operations, assault
    and battery, and formation of a phone communication headquarters. .
    Evidence of guilt The Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office communiqu
    states that cyanide tablets were recovered from Mr. Ratebi and two other
    individuals. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ratebi s defense.
    Judgment The Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal found Mr. Ratebi
    guilty of waging war on God and the Prophet, corruption on earth , and
    rebellion, and sentenced him to death. Mr. Ratebi was executed by a firing
    squad on August 23, 1981 in Tehran s Evin Prison.
    _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981,
    the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and
    assassinated a number
