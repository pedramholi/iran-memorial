    Banihashem-Abdolvase were announced as, serious activity in the Monafeqin
    [Mojahedin] Organization, leading Monafeqin and all anti-revolutionaries
    in Khorasan, especially in Quchan, having contacts with high ranking
    members of the organization, possessing pamphlets containing political and
    military training such as how to demonstrate and how to make a Molotov
    cocktail and handmade grenade, misleading the honest young and provoking
    them to fight against so called reactionaries, and supporting deposed
    [president] Banisadr as the leader of a so called anti-reactionary front,
    using signs and codes of hypocritical analyses of the current political
    situation and inspiring ignorant sympathizers, and ultimately creating
