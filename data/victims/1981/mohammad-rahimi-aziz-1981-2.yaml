    A reader, a wrestler, and an accountant, he quietly helped neighbors in
    financial need. Communication skills came into play when he worked with a
    revolutionary marxist group (1975 81). Information about Mr. Aziz
    Mohammad-Rahimi, son of Jalil, was collected from interviews with two
    individuals who were close to him. His execution was announced in a
    statement of the Public Relations Department of the Prosecution Office of
    Tehran, printed in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on September 20, 1981.
    Also, Mr. Mohammad-Rahimi is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. He was born in Tehran on April 20, 1951. He was a
    member of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, Minority faction. He worked as
    an accountant and was a student of accounting. In 1975, he started his
    political activism with the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization and was detained
    for a short period. When there was a split within the organization, he
    joined the Minority faction since he strongly opposed the Islamic Republic
    regime. He was in charge of the labor section of the organization in the
    south of Tehran. He was in contact with workers and promoted their
    ideological principles. According to a relative, He was honest and
    friendly, and very sympathetic to hard-working people. Since he was
    employed, he was relatively well-off. His family lived in a working class
    neighborhood. He helped those in financial need, although he never
    mentioned that to his family members. It was only after his execution,
    that his family heard stories about how he helped others. On his personal
    traits, the interviewee says, He liked wrestling and practiced in the
    gymnasium. He also loved books, and read about a broad range of subjects.
    He had the ability to communicate with everyone and exchange ideas with
    them. He was very humble. An interviewee remembers that one day, when the
    revolution was at its peak and about to topple the monarchy, Mr.
    Mohammad-Rahimi came home and said that one repressive regime was going to
    replace another. The statement of the prosecution office that announced
    his execution, begins with this verse of the Quran, God has promised the
    hypocrites, both men and women, as well as the deniers of the truth, the
    fire of hell (IX: 68). The statement says, Heroic and militant nation with
    your cooperation and with the endeavors of the 20 million strong military
    of our brothers in the armed forces, the ugly face of hypocrites has been
    unveiled, and with the discovery of the den of corruption of mercenaries
    of the super-powers, duplicity will be uprooted from our society, and the
    society of Islamic justice will be founded The Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecution Office has been established on the basis of Islamic rules and
    principles and is trying to create a healthy atmosphere and the
    realization of divine justice The statement goes on to announce the
    execution of 19 people who are at war with God and His Prophet, and who
    are corruptors on earth. Two of Mr. Mohammad-Rahimi s sisters, Soheila and
    Mehrangiz, were executed in the massacre of political prisoners in 1988.
    His nephew, Hossein Majidi was killed in Evin Prison in 1981. Mr.
    Mohammad-Rahimi s brother, Hushang, was executed in 1992. The Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban
    Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded
    in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following
    the 1979 revolution, the organization, which had renounced armed struggle,
    split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union.
    The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active
    mainly in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Mohammad-Rahimi was arrested at his work-place in Tehran on July 28,
    1981, and taken to Evin Prison. His family found out from other Evin
    prisoners that he was arrested by agents of the intelligence section of
    the Revolutionary Guards. According to an interviewee, as a result of
    torture, his kidneys failed, [and] his feet were swollen and infected.
    This person explained, since the prison authorities know that he was from
    a political family, and that he was active as a member of his
    organization, they tortured him to obtain information about his comrades.
    Trial The newspaper report mentions the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Tehran. No other information is available about Mr. Mohammad-Rahimi s
    trial. Charges The prosecution office announced that Mr. Mohammad-Rahimi
    was charged with presence in safe-houses, being in charge of a team [that
    participated in] armed demonstrations against the Muslim people, and
    having participated in terrorist crimes for his organization. T
