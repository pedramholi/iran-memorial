    The news of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Me’raj and three other
    individuals was announced in a report published in Kayhan on July 22,
    1981. Mr. Me’raj, 21, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, (occupation, political affiliation) is also one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members’
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah’s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization’s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this Mr. Me’raj’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Based on the available information the Amol Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal issued Mr. Me’raj’s sentence. No information is available on Mr.
    Me’raj’s trial. Charges Establishing and living in safe houses, plotting
    against and planning to overthrow the Islamic Republic, collecting money
    from people under the guise of helping victims of the war and sending it
    to the higher-ups in the organization, identifying and reporting on
    religious individuals, and collecting official documents from a bank and
    the Amol department of education. . Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Me’raj. Defense No information is available on Mr. Me’raj’s
    defense. Judgment The Amol Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal found Mr. Me’raj
    guilty of corruption on earth, waging war on God and God’s Prophet, and
    rebellion, and sentenced him to death. Mr. Me’raj was executed by a firing
    squad on July 20, 1981. *The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities’ different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as “Hypocrites” and the
    Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers
    regularly during demonstrations and while distributing publications,
    leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO
    called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental
    officials and the government officials’ efforts to impeach their ally,
    President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called
    this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom
    confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of
    casualties that resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large
    number of demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days
    and weeks. The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime
    started a repressive campaign – unprecedented in modern Iranian history.
    Thousands of MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On
    June 21, 1981, the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic
    Republic and assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and
    supporters of the Islamic regime. In the summer of 1981, the leader of the
    MKO and the impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France,
    where they founded the National Council of Resistance. After the MKO
    leaders and many of its members were expelled from France, they went to
    Iraq and founded the National Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which
