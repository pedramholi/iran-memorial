    News of the execution of Mr. Bahman Mohseni-Tabrizi, son of Ali, along
    with three others, was published in the Keyhan newspapers on December 23,
    1981. The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Masjedsoleiman issued an
    announcement about this execution and released it to the media. Also the
    Public Relations Department of the Central Revolutionary and Public
    Prosecutor s Office issued another announcement about the execution of Mr.
    Mohammadmehdi Mohammadi and four others on December 27, 1981. Mr. Bahman
    Mohseni-Tabrizi is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the
    list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. According to this report, Mr. Bahman Mohseni-Tabrizi, 22,
    had a bachelor degree. Mr. Bahman Mohseni-Tabrizi is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to the announcement by the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Masjedsoleiman, the charges against Mr. Bahman Mohseni-Tabrizi were:
    "Sympathizing with the American Organization of Peykar and having
    connection with the high level members of the organization." According to
    the announcement by the Public Relations Department of the Central
    Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor s Office, his charges were "effective
    activity against the Islamic Republic regime, weakening the regime by
    distribution of communist books, publications, and posters, misleading the
    younger generation by organizing anti-revolutionaries under the pretext of
    creating a support fund for those who were purged in the educational
    field, and establishing connections between various individuals in the
    organization." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Bahman Mohseni-Tabrizi's
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Masjedsoleiman
    identified Mr. Bahman Mohseni-Tabrizi as "Mofsed (corruptor on Earth),
    Baghi (rebel) against Imam and the Islamic Regime, and Mortad (apostate)"
    and condemned him to death. The ruling was carried out in Shushtar on
    December 21, 1981 at midnight.
