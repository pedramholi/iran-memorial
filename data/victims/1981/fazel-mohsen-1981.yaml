    The following information about Mr. Mohsen Fazel, son of Ahmad, was
    obtained through an interview with a person close to him, and his own
    writings in prison. Mr. Fazel was born in Mashhad on October 7, 1949. He
    was a student in Chemical Engineering at Aryamehr University and a member
    of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class. After
    the widespread arrest of Mojahedin in 1971, he went underground and in
    1974 left for Beirut, where he was active in the Palestine movement under
    the pseudonym Sami. In November 1978, he returned to Iran as a member of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (Marxist-Leninist Section) and was
    dispatched to Lebanon briefly on a political mission in 1979. He worked
    for a construction company for a few months in 1979-1980. He is one of the
    430 individuals whose name appears on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those members
    of the Organization who died after the Revolution of 1979. More than 400
    of the individuals on this list have been executed. This execution was
    also announced in the addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published
    by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization on September 6, 1985. The list
    includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups,
    who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic
    security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention On February 3, 1981, Mr. Fazel paid a
    visit to the passport office regarding another trip to Lebanon. On his way
    out of the office he was arrested by several individuals in civilian
    clothes. His detention location was Evin Prison where he was kept
    incommunicado in solitary confinement for 139 days (until his execution).
    Even the attorney that his family hired for him was not allowed to meet
    with him. Initially, the prison officials denied his existence entirely;
    however, three weeks later when the news of his arrest appeared on the
    first page of Ettela’at newspaper as well as in the Kayhan and the Jomhuri
    Eslami newspapers, they told his family that “he is here but not allowed
    to have visitors.” At that point, his family contacted Palestinian
    officials in Tehran, who knew him as “Sami”, in order to obtain
    information about his situation. The officials responded: “we have been
    warned by Iranian officials to stay away from this issue.” Mr. Mohsen
    Fazel has recounted the events of his arrest and his time in prison in
    thirty-nine pages written in prison and smuggled out of prison. He wrote
    about the difficult time of solitary confinement, and being deprived of
    newspapers, books, and even paper and pen at times: “This is my seventieth
    day in prison and still my status is unclear. Everyday, I have nothing to
    do for 14-15 hours. The first 30-40 days in solitary confinement is really
    terrifying. You wonder if time passes by at all, or whether you can bear
    with time going by so slowly”. These pages as well as his will have been
    published by Peykar Organization. Trial The details of court session(s)
    are not known. He has written in his notes from prison: “I’m wondering
    what charges will be brought up against me. Since the day my interrogator
    told me to wait for trial, it has already been 39 days. In his will
    published by Peykar Organization he’s written: “Finally after spending 139
    days in solitary confinement deprived of everything, in this politically
    charged atmosphere, in a rush trial, I was sentenced to death.” Charges
    Mr. Fazel’s charge has been specified as “internal purges of the Mojahedin
    Organization.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt There is no information regarding the
    evidence presented against the defendant. In his will, Mr. Fazel has
    written about the accusation of participation in the internal purges of
    the Mojahedin Organization: “They brought up a charge against me which was
    not, and could not be, supported by any evidence
