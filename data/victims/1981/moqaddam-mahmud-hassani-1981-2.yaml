    Information about Mr. Mahmud Hassani Moqaddam is drawn from an electronic
    form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. He is one of
    the 430 individuals whose name appears on the list of Martyrs of the
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on
    the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those
    members of the Organization who died after the Revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. His name is
    also mentioned in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published
    by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. According to the form, he was a
    mathematics teacher. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social
    imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    exact circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not
    known. According to the form, Mr. Hassani Moqaddam was arrested at
    midnight in July of 1981 at his house in Tehran with the allegation of
    living in a safe house. He was detained in Evin prison. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Hassani Moqaddam are not known. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment According to the Peykar list, Mr.
    Mahmud Hassani Moqaddam was executed by a firing squad on August 16, 1981.
    The electronic form states the execution was on August 12 and in Evin
    prison.
