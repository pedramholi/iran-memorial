    The Public Relations Office of Evin Prison announced the execution of Mr.
    Hamid Reza Khoshnam, son of Reza, and 11 other individuals to the Pars
    news agency. The news was published in the Kayhan and the Johuri Eslami
    newspapers on August 5, 1981. Mr. Khoshnam’s name is also mentioned in the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Peykar Andeesheh, the Peykar
    magazine, No. 120 (Sep. 29, 1981), and the addendum of the Mojahed
    magazine, No. 261 (Sep. 6, 1985) listing 12,028 individuals executed or
    killed in clashed with Iranian security forces. Mr. Khoshnam was 21 years
    old and a member of the Arman-e Kargar Organization, which merged with the
    Peykar Organization. He was a candidate to become a member of the Peykar
    Organization, and was in charge of the regional committee of southern part
    of Tehran City ( Peykar magazine). His brother, Majid Reza was also
    executed the same year. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to Peykar , Mr. Khoshnam was arrested during the raids of
    publishing houses and other centers of the Peykar Organization by the
    agents of the Islamic Republic in the summer of 1981. No further
    information is available on the arrest and detention of Mr. Khoshnam.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr.
    Khoshnam was charged with “rebellion” or “armed action against the Islamic
    Republic” according to Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami respectively. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on his defense. Judgment The Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Mr. Hamid Reza Khoshnam to death.
    According to the Mojahed magazine, he was shot by a firing squad on August
    4, 1981 in Evin prison.
