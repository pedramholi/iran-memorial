    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Reza Tabataba ian Nimavardi, son of Reza,
    along with 25 others, was published by Kayhan and Jomhuri-e Eslami
    newspapers on October 10, 1981, quoting a communiqu from the Public
    Relations department of the General Public Prosecutor s Office. News of
    the executions, names, and charges against defendants are reflected in
    this communiqu . Additional information is based on two electronic forms
    sent to Omid by his relatives. Mr. Ali Reza Tabataba ian Nimavardi is one
    of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No, 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According
    to the existing information, Mr. Ali Reza Tabataba ian Nimavardi, the
    third child in his family, was born in Esfahan on October 26, 1963. He was
    single, a high school student, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. He was active in publishing the Mojahed newspaper in
    Esfahan. According to his relatives, he was very smart and successful in
    his education. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary,
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam to be their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology.
    In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were
    imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a split within the
    Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the
    imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along with other
    political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to recruit new
    members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    primary in the organization s agenda. During the first two years after the
    Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic s leaders. * Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Tabataba ian Nimavardi s arrest and detention are not
    known. According to the information sent to Omid, he was arrested by the
    Revolutionary Guards in Esfahan in the summer of 1981. He was transferred
    to Dastgerd Prison, Quarantine Section, where he was detained for about
    two months. He was denied the right to have an attorney. He was only
    allowed to write a single letter during his detention period. His only
    visitation with family members was the day before his execution.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing a crime. As a
    party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on
    the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offense committed before the age of eighteen. Trial No
    information is available regarding the trial of Mr. Tabataba ian
    Nimavardi. According to the communiqu from the Public Relations department
    of the General Public Prosecutor s Office, the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Esfahan condemned Mr. Tabataba ian Nimavardi and 25 others to death.
    According to the electronic forms, the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Esfahan tried him in a half an hour session a week before his execution.
