circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Abbas Zare' and five others was reported by the
    correspondent of the Ettela’at daily in Kerman (July 6, 1981). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr.
    Zare' had been charged with "participation in creating a drug trafficking
    band and selling 4 kilogram of heroin." Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain any information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Zare''s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman
    declared Mr. Zare' a "corruptor on earth." The death sentence was carried
    out at 6:00 am.
