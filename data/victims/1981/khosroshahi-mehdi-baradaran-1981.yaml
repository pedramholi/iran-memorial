    Mr. Mehdi Baradaran Khosrowshahi was executed along with 89 other
    prisoners. The information regarding his execution was obtained through an
    interview with his sister who was arrested at the same time and imprisoned
    for ten years. Mr. Baradaran Khrosroshahi is also one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Baradaran
    Khosrowshahi was a student in Tehran Polytechnic Faculty and an employee
    of Tolidaru Company. Before the 1979 Revolution, he spent seven years
    (1971-1978) in prison because he was a high ranking and influential member
    of Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In prison, he distanced himself
    from the MKO and sympathized with Marxism. After the revolution, he joined
    Rahe Kargar Organization. After the revolution, leaders of the Islamic
    Republic, angered by this kind of ideological shift, sought to arrest
    those who changed their ideology. It was a common belief among many
    leaders of the Islamic Republic that those who leave Islam are apostates
    and deserve death penalty. After the execution, the psychological pressure
    and humiliation of Mr. Baradaran Khosrowshahi’s family continued. When
    prison officials called to tell the family about his execution, they
    reminded his sister that she could not get information about her brother’s
    burial place because only a man in the family could obtain such
    information. Therefore, Mr. Baradaran Khosrowshahi’s sick brother had to
    go to the prison, where he was mistreated. When the officials issued the
    death certificate, under cause of death they wrote “natural death” instead
    of “shot by the firing squad.” In spite of efforts by Mr. Baradaran
    Khosrowshahi’s wife inside the prison, and by his family outside, the
    officials never delivered any of his personal belongings. Contrary to the
    norm, his family never received his will. And the final indignity was that
    his tombstone was broken repeatedly. Arrest and detention Mr. Mehdi
    Baradaran Khosrowshahi and his wife were arrested by eight Pasdars
    (Revolutionary Guards) in their house on the night of October 17, 1981.
    The guards searched the house taking all books and family pictures.
    Afterwards, they went to his parents’ house and arrested his sister. For
    the first ten days, he was held and interrogated in Eshratabad Komite.
    Then he was transferred to Evin Prison where he was tortured continuously
    while he was interrogated. His sister says: “I was tortured at the same
    place.” She recalls: “I could see through my blindfold that standing
    beside the interrogator was a clergyman. I could hear him responding to a
    question about who I was, by saying: 'Hajaqa, her brother was here last
    night.' Later, we heard from a released inmate that my brother had
    suffered brutal torture in Evin prison. This inmate had seen my brother
    coming back from an interrogation several times with severely wounded feet
    and each time he would say something sarcastic about “the Islamic
    Democracy”. The sister of Mr. Mehdi Baradaran continued: “In addition to
    the interrogator of Branch Six of Evin Prosecutor, Lajevardi himself also
    participated in my brother’s interrogation. I myself witnessed (when we
    were returned at night from the bathroom to our cell, which was located in
    the interrogation hallway) the interrogator and Lajevardi standing close
    to my brother (who was blindfolded). The interrogator asked whether my
    brother knew Mr. Lajevardi. My brother said: I know him by name. The
    interrogator said: 'Weren't you both in prison together under the Shah?'
    My brother responded: 'I was in Shiraz prison and he was in Mashhad.'
    After that, they both left together." Mr. Mehdi Baradaran Khosrowshahi was
    denied the right to have an attorney, the right to have access to his
    file, the right to be visited during the 50 days of his imprisonment. He
    was allowed a phone call to his wife only 30 minutes before his execution.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. According to
    his sister, in those days, the routine procedure was to have a few minutes
    trial with presence of the religious judge. Charges The officials did not
    announce any specific charge against Mr. Baradaran Khosrowshahi. In his
    last telephone conversation, he mentioned his crime was “being a prisoner
    in previous regime”. According to his sister, his crime was nothing but
    his ideological shift in MKO. (Those members of Mojahedin Khalq who
    followed Marxism were considered “apostate” by the Islamists.) Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Baradaran Khosrowshahi's defense. Judgement The
    Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Baradaran Khosrowshahi to d
