    The information about Mr. Ali Mahbaz is based on an interview with his
    sister. He was born in Fatideh village near Langerud (Gilan province) in
    1947 and had two children. He was a science lab expert and worked in the
    laboratory of Sorkheh Hesar Hospital. He was a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization. Before the Revolution, he was imprisoned for political
    activities for two years (1974-76). After he was executed, the officials
    dismissed his wife, who was a medical doctor, from work. A few years after
    his execution, prison officials called his family and told them that Ali's
    execution was a mistake and asked for their forgiveness. The Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban
    Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded
    in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following
    the 1979 Revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle,
    split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union.
    The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority considered the Islamic Republic as a
    revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime and supported it. After the
    spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely
    because of their political beliefs. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of his arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Ali Mahbaz was arrested at
    his workplace in August, 1981. He was detained at Evin prison for two and
    a half months. Trial No information is available on the defendant's trial.
    Charges No information is available on Mr. Ali Mahbaz's charges. According
    to his sister, during a phone conversation with his wife before his
    execution he relayed his charges as "being Marxist and misleading the
    youth." Additionally, after his execution the officials told his wife that
    Ali Mahbaz had donated blood to the injured members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available about his defense. He was denied the
    right to have an attorney. Judgment No specific information is available
    about the verdict leading to this execution. According to the above
    source, Mr. Ali Mahbaz was executed by a firing squad at Evin prison on
    December 19, 1981. A Revolutionary Guard who worked in the prison told
    Ali's family that he was killed by 9 bullets.
