    Information about Mr. Ahmad Nayeri, son of Ali Akbar, has been drawn from
    an in interview with an individual close to him. He was born in Tehran on
    February 4, 1962. He started his political activities in high school and
    was a sympathizer of the Razmandegan organization. He studied at the
    technical college of Tehran University in the department of mining
    engineering. He always opposed armed struggle. The interviewee remembers
    him as a gentle person with a passion for mathematics. His brother, Mohsen
    Nayeri, was executed in 1982. The Razmandegan Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded in the winter of 1979. Its
    activities were focused on the working class and factories. The founding
    tenets of Razmandegan included the rejection of armed struggle and a
    strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party.
    It viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state and believed
    that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles. Razmandegan
    was among the groups that became known as Khat-e Se (Third line). By early
    1981, disagreements on the Party’s position on the Iran-Iraq war caused
    internal splits in Razmandegan. These splits, which coincided with the
    massive and brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian government,
    caused the Organization to disband. Arrest and detention Mr. Nayeri was
    arrested at the bus terminal in Shiraz on November 26, 1981. He was first
    taken to the Revolutionary Guards station in Shiraz and later transferred
    to their headquarters in Tehran. While in detention, the authorities
    denied him any visitation rights and his family was not informed of his
    whereabouts. Trial There is no information regarding this trial. Charges
    The Iranian authorities did not inform his family of the charges brought
    against him. When his family went to the office established by Ayatollah
    Montazeri to address prisoners’ relatives’ queries, the authorities stated
    that he had given shelter to a sympathizer of the Peykar organization and
    did not cooperate with the authorities at all. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available concerning Mr. Nayeri’s
    defense. Judgment No specific information is available about the verdict
    leading to this execution. Mr. Ahmad Nayeri was executed on December 27,
    1981. The authorities informed his family a few weeks after his interment
    in Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. The authorities did not return his belongings
    to his family other than his will. Mr. Nayeri, who addresses all his
    family members, starts his will as follows: “Today is Sunday, December 27,
    1981. As I’m writing these words, I don’t know how the course of events
    will unfold after I’m done writing. I can ease the passing of time only by
    relying on my emotions, speaking for the last time with you my loved ones,
    and recalling the sweet memories of the times I spent with you.”
