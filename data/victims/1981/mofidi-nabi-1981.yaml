    Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Nabi Mofidi was
    published in the Tufan Publication, Iran Labor Party s print publication.
    (August 2010). News of Mr. Mofidi s execution was also published in
    Mojahed Publication s Appendix Number 261, published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization of Iran, dated September 6, 1985. This Appendix
    contains the names of 12,028 individuals, mostly affiliated with political
    groups opposed to the Iranian regime, who were either executed between
    June 20, 1981, until the date of publication of the Mojahed Publication,
    or killed in skirmishes with the Islamic Republic police forces. According
    to available information, Mr. Mofidi was a high school student, single,
    and an active supporter or the Tufan Party. He was born in a hardworking
    family. At the age of 10, he became familiar with the Party and its works
    through his teacher, Janbarar Ruhi (member of the Tufan Party who was
    executed by firing squad on August 18, 1981). He became a member of the
    Party s Student Section Shanbeh-ye Sorkh ( Red Saturday ) upon its
    establishment, and started his activities in the village of Mahmudabad and
    its vicinity. According to Tufan Publication, Mr. Mofidi always vigorously
    defended the students legitimate demands. He was always harassed by
    radicals and extremists, and was subjected to physical and psychological
    pressure and cowardly attacks. After June 20, 1981 when most of Mahmudabad
    s political activists fled, Mr. Mofidi also went to Yeylagh (mountainous
    regions in the Caspian Sea region where the locals go to escape heat and
    humidity) with his mother. The Tufan Organization The Marxist-Leninist
    Organization of Tufan was founded in the late 1960s. De-Stalinization
    policy of Khoroshev in the Soviet Union led to a political crisis in
    Iranian communist party Tudeh, as in many communist parties around the
    world. Three Tudeh leaders i.e. Forutan, Qasemi Saqa i left the Party in
    1963 to found the Revolutionary Organization of the Tudeh Party and then
    the Marxist-Leninist Organization of Tufan . The organization changed its
    name after the 1979 revolution and first became The Party of workers and
    farmers of Iran and later on Iran Work Party, Tufan. The Party believed in
    a one-party system and supported a political system modeled after Albania,
    which it considered as the only socialist countries. The Organization of
    Struggling Workers of Iran is a split from Tufan founded by some of the
    party s personnel. Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic
    Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of
    politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Ever since
    the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the
    country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979, and have continued during
    the existence of the Islamic Republic both inside and outside Iran. The
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has identified over 540 murders outside Iran
    attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. (3) Opponents of the Islamic
    Republic have been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic in
    various ways outside Iran, in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases, not much information has been published
    about these murders and local officials have not issued any arrest
    warrants. Documentation, evidence, and traces obtained through
    investigations conducted by local police and judicial authorities confirm,
    however, the theory of state committed crimes. In certain cases, these
    investigations have resulted in the expulsion (The Netherlands, 2018) or
    arrest (Brussels, 2020; Turkey, 2021) of Iranian diplomats. In limited
    cases outside Iran, the perpetrators of these murders have been arrested
    and put on trial (Paris 1980 and 1991) and the evidence presented,
    revealed the defendants connection to Iran s government institutions, and
    an arrest warrant (the Mikonos Trial in Germany) has been issued for Iran
    s then-Minister of Information. The manner in which these killings were
    organized and implemented in Iran and abroad, is indicative of a single
    pattern which, according to Roland Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor,
    contains common parameters and detailed planning. It can be ascertained
    from the similarities between these murders in different countries that
    the Iranian government is the principal entity who ordered the
    implementation of these crimes. (4). Iranian authorities have not
    officially accepted responsibility for these murders and have even
    attributed their commission to their opposition. Nevertheless,
