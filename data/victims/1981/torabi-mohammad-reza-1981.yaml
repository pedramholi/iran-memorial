    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza (Amin) Torabi, son of Hossein,
    along with four others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    October 14, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Public
    Prosecutor’s Office issued an announcement concerning these executions,
    the defendants’ names, and their charges, and released it to the media.
    Mr. Torabi is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of
    “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. He is also among
    the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985.
    The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups,
    who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic
    security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges The Public Relations Department of the
    Central Public Prosecutor’s Office announced the charges against Mr.
    Torabi as: “membership in terrorist teams, armed uprising against the
    ruling of Allah, planning and participating in several robberies, stealing
    a car and its license plaque, robbing several banks, frequenting the team
    houses, and corruption and prostitution nests in Tehran, Karaj, and Bandar
    Abbas, importing weapons into Bandar Abbas, recovered G3, Uzi, and Colt
    weapons in addition to bullets and grenades, collecting financial aid for
    the terrorist organization of Hypocrites [Mojahedin Khalq], identifying
    the personnel of the Revolutionary Guards, Basij, Bandar Abbas police, and
    some Hezbollah individuals for assassination, being responsible for all
    assassinations in Bandar Abbas, attacking and disarming some police
    officers in Bandar Abbas, arson of houses and shops, and forging public
    documents and IDs for various individuals.” These charges were announced
    against five defendants collectively. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. The above announcement, however, stated “recovered
    G3, Uzi, and Colt weapons in addition to bullets and grenades, collecting
    financial aid for the terrorist organization of Hypocrites [Mojahedin
    Khalq]” for all five defendants. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Torabi's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Bandar
    Abbas identified Mr. Torabi as “corruptor on earth, enemy of God and the
    Prophet, and a rebel” and condemned him to death. He was executed on
    October 13, 1981.
