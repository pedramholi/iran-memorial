    The execution of Mr. Moharram Ali Abdollahi, son of Rajab Ali, along with
    19 other individuals, was announced in the Kayhan on September 12, 1981.
    The communiqué of the Public Relations Department of the Prosecutor’s
    Office of the Islamic Republic was made available to the Pars News Agency
    and published in Kayhan . Mr. Abdollahi is also one of the 430 individuals
    whose name appears on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. Moreover, this execution was also announced in the addendum of
    the Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr.
    Abdollahi was charged with “organizing a safe house, seeking new members
    for the American group of Peykar, derogation of youth, and activism
    against the regime of the Islamic Republic. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Abdollahi’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Qazvin condemned Mr. Moharram Ali Abdollahi to death. He was
    shot by a firing squad on September 8, 1981.
