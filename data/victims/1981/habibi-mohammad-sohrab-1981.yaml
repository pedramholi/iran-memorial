    In his last defense in court stated: We Baha is are not political by any
    means, and have no direct or indirect relations with any government in the
    world, and there is no evidence against us [to that effect]. News of the
    execution of Mr. Mohammad (Sohrab) (also spelled " Muhammad (Suhrab)")
    Habibi, son of Nurmohammad and Hayat Soltan, and six other individuals*
    was published in Ettela at and Kayhan newspapers on June 15, 1981.
    Additional information about this case was obtained from Ettela at
    newspaper (June 17, and July 9, 1981); documents published on the Archives
    of Baha i Persecution in Iran website including his biography; the last
    letter of two of his co-defendants (June 13, 1981); the defense written by
    the [city of] Hamedan Spiritual Assembly members (February 11, 1981); a
    Revolutionary Guardsman s testimony on his and his co-defendants behalf;
    Baha is National Spiritual Assembly of the United States Andalib (Winter
    1990); Iran Wire website (September 7, 2014); the Baha i News videos on a
    YouTube channel (June 11, 2016); Baha is in the Media website (December
    2008-January 2009); Gooya News website (April 28, 2015); and Martyrs of
    the Baha i Faith website (February 9, 2013). Mr. Habibi was Born into a
    Baha i family in the city of Hamedan in February-March 1933. He had a high
    school diploma and worked at the city of Hamedan s Malaria Eradication
    Administration for a while, then started to repair radio and television
    sets with his brother. He was married with two children. (Martyrs of the
    Baha i Faith website, Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran). Mr. Habibi
    had gone to one of Hamedan s villages to promote the Baha i faith, when he
    was forced to leave because of harassment by the region s residents.
    (Martyrs of the Baha i Faith website). Mr. Habibi had been a member of the
    city of Hamedan s Spiritual Assembly** since 1970. (Martyrs of the Baha i
    Faith Facebook page). This case is related to the arrest of 7 members of
    the Hamedan s Baha i Spiritual Assembly in 1980. The Baha is in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The Baha i religious community is the
    largest minority group in Iran, with approximately 300,000 members in 1979
    (more current figures are not available).*** The authorities of the
    Islamic Republic have subjected Baha is religious to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence. **** Arrest and
    detention In the afternoon of August 13, 1980, Mr. Habibi was arrested at
    his home by the Islamic Republic Revolutionary Guards forces. He had
    received a summons from the Hamedan Islamic Revolutionary Court a few days
    earlier, and was supposed to go to court on the prescribed date. After his
    arrest, Mr. Habibi contacted his wife by phone asking her to deliver his
    personal effects to the prison. (Martyrs of the Baha i Faith Facebook
    page). Mr. Habibi spent 21 days at the Revolutionary Guards detention
    center and was subsequently transferred to the Police Force prison. He
    endured physical torture during detention. Mr. Habibi was denied
    visitations for 3 months after his arrest. (Archives of Baha i Persecution
    in Iran). His and his co-defendants cell was located next to the ward
    toilets and was so small that they had to take turns sleeping. According
    to handwritten notes obtained from one of Mr. Habibi s co-defendants, they
    were incarcerated in a dirty and polluted environment and were deprived of
    the most basic health and hygiene requirements, including showering .
    According to this person, in order to combat lice and other pollutants,
    they used [bleach, detergents,] and heavy duty chemical cleansers multiple
    times a day. (Iran Wire). Mr. Habibi s and his co-defendants families
    wrote numerous letters to Iran s government officials and judicial
    authorities in order to have them lift their visitation ban. According to
    the families of Mr. Habibi s co-defendants, the prison guards did not
    allow the prisoners and their families to speak to one another in their
    first visitation. Mr. Habibi and his ward mates were allowed two
    visitations per week with their families. (Iran Wire). According to the
    spouse of one of Mr. Habibi s co-defendants, in the first two weeks of
    visitations, only the prisoners children were permitted to visit with
    their fathers; thereafter, their spouses were allowed visitation as well.
    Mr. Habibi and his co-defendants were kept in the general ward for four
    months and were then transferred to the political prisoners ward. (Martyrs
    of the Baha i Faith Facebook page, Martyrs of the Baha i Faith weblog).
