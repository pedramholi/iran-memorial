    News and information regarding the execution of Mr. Mojtaba Ahmadzadeh,
    son of Taher, is sent to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center by a person who knew
    him via an electronic form on December 11, 2020. (ABC e-form) Mr.
    Ahmadzadeh is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. Additional information is taken from Bidaran website. Mr.
    Mojtaba Ahmadzadeh was born on May 18, 1956 in Mashhad. He was a student
    at Sharif University in Tehran. He was a member of Razmandegan
    Organization was known as leftist activist at the university. He was
    living in hiding since June 1981. (ABC e-form) The Razmandegan
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded in the
    winter of 1979. Its activities were focused on the working class and
    factories. The founding tenets of Razmandegan included the rejection of
    armed struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the
    Iranian Tudeh Party. It viewed the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist
    state and believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist
    principles. Razmandegan was among the groups that became known as Khat-e
    Se (Third line). By early 1981, disagreements on the Party s position on
    the Iran-Iraq war caused internal splits in Razmandegan. These splits,
    which coincided with the massive and brutal repression of dissidents by
    the Iranian government, caused the Organization to disband. Arrest and
    detention Once the members of Islamic Association of Students identified
    Mr. Ahmadzadeh, he got arrested in early September 1981. There are no
    further information regarding his arrest except that he was being

    the time. Mr. Ahmadzadeh was detained in Evin Prison. (ABC e-form) Trial
