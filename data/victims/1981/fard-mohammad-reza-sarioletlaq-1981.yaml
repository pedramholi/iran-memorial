    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammadreza Sari oletlaq-Fard, son of Ali,
    along with twenty-two others, was published in the Kayhan and Jomhuri
    Eslami newspapers on July 19, 1981, quoting the Public Relations Office of
    the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office of the Islamic Republic.
    Mr. Mohammadreza Sari oletlaq-Fard is also one of the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According to this
    source, Mr. Mohammadreza Sari oletlaq-Fard was a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Arrest and detention According to the
    announcement by the Public Relations Office of the Public and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office of the Islamic Republic, Mr.
    Mohammadreza Sari oletlaq-Fard, along with eighty-nine others, was
    arrested by the Revolutionary Guards in Hezardastgah Naziabad Golabdareh
    on June 17, 1981. The Revolutionary Guards had surrounded the building.
    Mr. Mohammadreza Sari oletlaq-Fard was detained and interrogated for
    eighteen days. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran tried these
    defendants. The trial sessions continued in various branches of the
    Revolutionary Courts until July 5, 1981. Charges The charges against Mr.
    Mohammadreza Sari oletlaq-Fard, along with fourteen others, were
    collectively announced as, being main coordinators, trainers, and
    directors of the team house, supplying weapons, sending other defendants
    to the streets and public places after being trained for using weapons,
    and personally fighting with weapons. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the above
    report, the evidence presented against the defendants was as follows:
    During the search of the mentioned team house, many weaponries were
    recovered such as G3 machineguns, Molotov cocktails, containers of
    incendiary materials, bullets for Colt, Uzi, and G3 weapons, bows and
    arrows, slings, knives, carpet cutters, homemade grenades, bags of salt
    and pepper, pieces of stone and brick, gallows ropes, and other tools such
    as spray paint, caskets, net caps, canteens, back packs, cameras, radios,
    calculators, overcoats, fabric bags, and many books and tapes and
    documents and publications of Monafeqin [Mojahedin Khalq] which were
    partially burned by them. The confessions of the defendants and
    testimonies of the Revolutionary Guards who discovered the team house were
    also presented as evidence. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions, during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    According to the announcement, the defendant defended himself after
    understanding the charges. The Prosecution s communiqu does not provide
    specific information on Mr. Mohammadreza Sari oletlaq-Fard's defense.
    Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran identified Mr.
    Mohammadreza Sari oletlaq-Fard as "Mofsed (corruptor on Earth), Mohareb [a
    person who wages war against God], Baghi (rebel), and for armed uprising
    against the rule of the Islamic Republic." He was condemned to death. The
    ruling was carried out when he was executed by firing squad in the Evin
    prison yard on July 5, 1981 at night. No specific information is available
    about the defendant s execution.
