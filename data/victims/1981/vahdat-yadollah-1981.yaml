    Information about the execution of Mr. Yadollah Vahdat was obtained from
    an announcement by the Office of Public Relations of the Revolutionary
    court of Shiraz, published in Enghelab-e Eslami (May 2nd 1981). Additional
    information was obtained from articles and letters published in the online
    Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran (ABPI) and the Baha i World, Volume
    18 (April 1979 -1983) and Baha i News, Issue s 610 (January, 1982) and 612
    (March. 1982) as well as an electronic form sent to the ABC on August
    18th, 2012 (E-form). Mr. Yadollah Vahdat is also one of the 206 Iranian
    Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i International
    Community. The report documents the persecution of the members of the
    Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since
    1978. Additional information has been drawn from various issues of the The
    Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Colonel
    Yadollah Vahdat, son of Mokhtar, was born in 1913 in Eshtehard, near
    Tehran (ABPI, Bio). After completing his elementary and secondary
    education at the Tarbiyat School in Tehran, he entered the Military
    Academy of Tehran and was eventually stationed in Shiraz after a number of
    postings (BW, Volume 18). In 1955, after reaching the rank of Colonel, he
    requested leave to complete a pilgrimage, which he had done once years
    before, which was denied. For unknown reasons, this request resulted in
    his superior forcing Colonel Vahdat to retire from military service. Col.
    Vahdat was married and had four children. His wife was a member of the
    Local Spiritual Assembly of Shiraz, condemned to life in prison in May
    1981 (ABPI, Kayhan May 5th, 1981) and he was an Auxiliary board member
    (ABPI, Bio). The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(2)- to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence.(3) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the
    Baha i threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national
    security in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and
    Detention Col. Vahdat and his wife were arrested on June 5th 1980. They
    were originally held in a Baha i Centre that had been converted into a
    temporary prison by the authorities called Mihdiyyih, but after
    preliminary examination they were transferred to Adelabad Prison (ABPI,
    Bio and BW Volume 18). Col. Vahdat s youngest daughter was able to visit
    them four times before she too was arrested (BW, Volume 18). Charges
    According to an announcement made by the Office of Public Relations of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shiraz, published in the daily Khabar Jonub
    (May 02, 1981) as well as a report by the Enghelab-e Eslami Newspaper (May
    02, 1981), the charges against Col. Vahdat and two other individuals were

    during the Revolution; striving to spread the culture of blasphemy and
    atheism; endeavouring to exhume the body of a Muslim in order to send the
    remains to Israel in cooperation with the supporters of the previous
    regime; relationship with a close colleague of Jimmy Carter, the former
    president of the [United States of] America; distributing monies received
    from Haifa, Israel, for the dissemination of blasphemy and hostility
