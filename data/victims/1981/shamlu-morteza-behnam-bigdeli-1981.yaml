    The news about the execution of Mr. Morteza (Behnam) Bigdeli Shamlu was
    announced by the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz which was published
    in Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on July 5, 1981. The announcement reads as
    follows: “While our heroic nation is fighting the attack of Saddam the
    Yazid, the puppet of America . . . the anti-human groups . . . under the
    guise of Mojahedin, Fadaiyan, and Peykar, in connivance with the enemy of
    this country and following the ominous plans of the world-domineering
    America, have engaged in an armed rebellion against the Islamic Republic.”
    Mr. Bigdeli Shamlu is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Additional information about Mr. Bigdeli Shamlu, son
    of Mohammad Sadeq, was sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person
    familiar with his case. Mr. Bigdeli Shamlu was born in 1965 in Ahvaz in a
    religious family. According to the information in the electronic form, he
    was a Muslim believer, knew Quran and Nahj al-Balagha by heart at age of
    12, helped the poor, and did not have any political affiliations.
    According to the announcement of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz
    and the addendum to the Mojahed magazine, Mr. Bigdeli Shamlu was a
    sympathizer of the Mojadehin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members’
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah’s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization’s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Mr. Bigdeli Shamlu was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Ahvaz. Charges According to the announcement of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Ahvaz, Mr. Bigdeli and three other defendants were collectively
    charged with “armed rebellion against the Islamic Republic of Iran” as
    affiliates of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Bigdeli Shamlu’s defense. His relative states that he did
    not have any political affiliation. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Ahvaz condemned Mr. Bigdeli Shamlu to death. He was executed by a
    firing squad at 1:45 a.m. on Thursday July 2, 1981 in Ahvaz. He was 16
    years old. International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment
    against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the
    crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
    Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid
    capital punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen.
    *The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of
    their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic
    Republic authorities’ different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap
    between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin
    as “Hypocrites” and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the de
