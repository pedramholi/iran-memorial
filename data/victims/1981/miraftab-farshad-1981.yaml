    Information on the life and execution of Ms. Farshad Miraftab has been
    gathered from an interview with one of her close relatives, conducted by
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, on December 18, 2011. Ms. Farshad
    Miraftab, daughter of Hossein, was born in Tehran, in 1955. She was a very
    intelligent child and a good student. She graduated from Kharazmi High
    School with very good grades and was awarded a scholarship to attend the
    American University in Beirut. However, since war had broken out in
    Lebanon, she decided to go to the United States, instead. She studied
    Industrial Design at the University of Iowa, and returned to Iran at the
    early stages of the Iranian Revolution. She entered the School of
    Architecture at Tehran University, in order to continue her education in
    City Planning. As Iranian society became politicized, Ms. Miraftab joined
    political and social activities, in sympathy with the Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class. After the Cultural Revolution and
    the closure of universities, Ms. Miraftab became an English teacher at the
    Simin Language Institute. She was a compassionate person and was always
    looking for ways to help the less fortunate members of society. Ms.
    Miraftab s political and social activities consisted of literacy classes
    for the underprivileged children of Varamin, and recruitment activities
    for the working class. Ms. Miraftab had plans to continue her education
    abroad. She had been accepted to the University of Seattle, and she was
    preparing for her trip. Since nobody knew about her teaching job, she
    spent her days at the language school. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    After one of her friends was arrested in October 1981, Ms. Miraftab would
    not stay at her own home. She spent the nights in different places. In the
    course of her limited political and social activities, she had become
    acquainted with an unemployed laborer, who had shown interest in political
    activity. She had told one of her cellmate that this person had reported
    her job at the language school and had brought about her arrest. On
    November 22, 1981, several armed officers went to the Simin Language
    Institute, and inquired about Ms. Mirafatb at the office. They went to her
    class and took her with them. After she was arrested, her family had no
    news of her whereabouts. She was held in Evin Prison for 28 days. During
    this time, she was able to contact her family one time. The night before
    her execution, she had a short conversation with her mother, and bid her
    farewell. One of the people who had been in prison with her, later told
    her family that she had been severely tortured. Trial No information is
    available on her trial. Charges The charge brought against Ms. Farshad
    Miraftab is not known. The interviewee had heard from someone who had been
    in prison with her that one of the bank accounts of Peykar Organization
    had been in her name. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the
    interviewee, the authorities did not mention any evidence against Ms.
    Miraftab, either during her short period of incarceration, or after her
    execution. Defense The interviewee believes that most probably there was
    never a trial, and she never had the opportunity to defend herself.
    Judgment Ms. Farshad Miraftab was executed by firing squad at dawn, on
    December 20, 1981, at Evin Prison. The night before, she was allowed to
    say goodbye to her mother during a phone conversation. On the letter she
    also wrote to her family on December 19, a few hours before her execution,
    possibly trying to calm their fears, she tells her family: I had a good
    time here. We were all together, and I was always thinking about you. She
    continues: It is night time, and this is the last time I can talk to you.
    In another place she says: I am writing this letter from Evin Prison , the
    next two lines have been crossed out, probably a reference to the exact
    location of her arrest or to her condition. She talks about her short
    life: I only lived 26 years, but you should know that I
