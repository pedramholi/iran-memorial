    The information about Ms. Hamideh Manafi Daryan is based on an interview
    with her cousin. Ms. Manafi (Mojahedin Khalq Iran) is also one of the
    12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. She was born in Tehran
    in 1960. She was a student in Pars College and a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Her seventeen year old brother, Farhad,
    committed suicide with a grenade when Revolutionary Guards attempted to
    arrest him in his uncle s house. The Guards arrested her uncle who served
    five years in prison. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded
    in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention According to the
    interviewee, Ms. Manafi Daryan was arrested in a Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization team house and was transferred to Evin prison. The officials
    denied her any visitation right claiming that she had not revealed her
    name. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges

    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available about her defense. Ms. Manafi Daryan was denied the right to

    his daughter, the Head of the prison, Lajevardi, told him that his
    daughter had been executed and gave him an envelope containing 150 Tumans.
