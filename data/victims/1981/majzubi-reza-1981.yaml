    The news of the execution of Mr. Reza Majzubi, along with that of 60
    others, was released by the Public Relations of the General Prosecutor's
    Office in a communiqu published in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on October 6,
    1981. Mr. Majzubi (Mojahedin Khalq Iran) is also one of the 12028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The communiqu , which
    specifies that those executed were members and sympathizers of the
    anti-people groups who had risen against Islam and the Qur'an , begins as
    follows: By purging the corruptors, clean the earth from corruption
    (Qur'an Karim). Those who have not embraced faith and are combating in an
    idolatrous path are forming rank against pious people, and, by martyring
    the best and purest men, are attesting to the fact that they are
    mercenaries of the great powers. It is the duty of you pious men to stand
    up against them and uproot infidelity and hypocrisy. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this Mr. Majzubi s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Majzubit s trial. Charges There
    is no mention of the charges brought against this defendant. The General
    Prosecutor's Office does, however, provide specific charges against one of
    the 61 individuals named in the communiqu : "It must be noted that
    Mohammad Kazem Golzadeh Ghafuri was directly involved in the attack
    against the Majlis [parliament] during which he had opened fire on the
    revolutionary guards in charge of the Majlis shuraye Eslami. He was an
    active member of the military teams of the Monafeqin [Hypocrites, term
    used by the Islamic Republic authorities when referring to the People s
    Mojaheddin Organization] and had also a role in the unsuccessful
    assassination attempt on Mr. Hojatolesalm Khaz'ali and Hojatoleslam Musavi
    Tabrizi, the General Prosecutor of the Revolution." The communiqu notes
    that all the other defendants were members and sympathizers of groups that
    it does not identify but refers to as anti-people groups. The charges
    against these groups, as specified in the communiqu , are as follows: "
    [rising] against Islam and the Qur'an by participating in armed
    demonstrations and clashes with the Revolutionary Guards, imposing
    martyrdom on people who are faithful to the revolution, being present in
    safe houses, identifying and assassinating known clerics and state
    dignitaries, carrying arms and grenades to oppose defenseless people,
    taking action in order to blow up various centers, and being involved in
    armed carjacking and bank robberies." Evidence of guilt The statement
    issued by the Prosecutor s Office does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against Mr. Majzubi. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Majzubi s defense. Judgment Based on the Public
    Prosecutor s Office communiqu , the defendant was sentenced to death for
    being rebellious against Islam , an enemy of God , and a corruptor on
    earth. The sentence was carried out at dawn in the courtyard of the
    Prison. _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from
