    News of the execution of Mr. Rahim Kamari, son of Hossein, along with
    twenty-two others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on November 12,
    1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor’s
    Office announced these executions, the defendants' names and their
    charges, and released this to the media. Mr. Kamari is one of the 430
    individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. He is also one of the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of
    dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Kamari were announced as "armed uprising against the
    Islamic Republic, distribution of announcements and publications for the
    Peykar Organization, apostate, and frequenting the organization's houses."
    These charges were announced for nine sympathizers of Peykar collectively.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Kamari's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tabriz condemned Mr. Kamari to death. The ruling
    was carried out in Tabriz on November 9 or 10, 1981. No exact information
    is available about the court verdict.
