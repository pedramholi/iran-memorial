    The information about Ms. Fariba Elahi Panah was sent to Omid by a friend,
    via an electronic form. She was born in August 1961 in Tehran. She was a
    student of mathematics in Tarbiat Moalem university in Tehran. She
    sympathized with the Peykar Organization. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    Ms. Elahi Panah was arrested in Tehran in November 1981. She was held in
    Evin prison. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Ms. Elahi Panah was charged with affiliation with the Peykar
    Organization. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Ms. Elahi Panah s defense. Judgment

    Elahi Panah was shot by firing squad on December 7, 1981, at the age of
    20. She is buried in Khavaran cemetery.
