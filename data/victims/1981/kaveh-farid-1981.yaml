    News of the execution of Mr. Farid Kaveh, son of Gholamali, and 29 other
    individuals, was printed in the announcement of the Office of Public
    Relations of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office and
    published in Kayhan Daily newspaper on December 1, 1981. The names and
    crimes of the accused have been stated in this announcement. Other details
    about this execution have been sent to the Boroumand Foundation via
    electronic forms, by persons close to Mr. Kaveh. Mr. Kaveh was 17 years
    old and was born in the city of Ardebil to a family of educators. He was a
    high school senior and a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    According to the Kayhan newspaper report, he had participated in the June
    20, 1981 demonstrations. Mr. Farid Kaveh is also one of the 12028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. * The demonstration of June 20,
    1981, took place in protest against the parliament s impeachment of
    President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic s systematic policy of
    excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) from the country s
    political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO
    leaders and his insistence for them to disarm. The MKO had until then
    supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function
    within the framework of the new political system. On June 20, the
    Organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations, in which some of the
    demonstrators were armed, all over the country. These demonstrations,
    which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of
    demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that targeted not only
    the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized as
    official government policy the months-old state harassment and suppression
    of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. According to the
    information contained in the forms, Mr. Kaveh was arrested in Tehran and
    detained at Evin Prison. He was allowed visitations. During one of these
    visits, he told his mother that he had been promised to be released. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant s trial. According to the
    announcement of the Office of Public Relations of the Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office, the Central Revolutionary Court issued
    the decision in the case of Mr. Kaveh and 29 other individuals. Charges
    According to the announcement of the Office of Public Relations of the
    Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office, Mr. Kaveh s charges
    have been stated as being member of the military team for reconnaissance,
    burning the shops belonging to Hezbollahi individuals, participation in
    armed demonstrations of June 20. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
