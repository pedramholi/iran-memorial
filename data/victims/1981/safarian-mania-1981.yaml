    She was a very serious girl. News of Ms. Mania Safarian s execution was
    submitted to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center through electronic form on
    October 17, 2018, by a person close to him. (Electronic form). News of
    this execution was also published in the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of
    Iran website (April 7, 2008), along with two other individuals in the
    Women s Commission website (November 20, 2015), and in Mojahed Publication
    s Appendix Number 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of
    Iran, dated September 6, 1985. This Appendix includes the names of 12,028
    individuals, mostly affiliated with political groups opposed to the
    Iranian regime. These individuals were either executed between June 20,
    1981, until the date of publication of the Mojahed Publication, or killed
    in skirmishes with the Islamic Republic police forces. Ms. Safarian was
    born in Khorramabad in 1961-62. She was the family s second child; she was
    single, a college student, and a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran. She was a very serious girl and considered
    everything very carefully at first. (Electronic form). The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention Ms.
    Safarian was arrested in September-October 1981. She spent two or three
    days in detention. (Electronic form). Ms. Safarian was tortured. (Women s
    Commission website). No other detail is available, however, regarding her
    arrest and detention. Trial Khorramabad Islamic Revolutionary Court tried
    Ms. Safarian with a Shari a judge presiding over the proceedings. No
    information is available, however, about the details of the trial
    session(s). Charges The charge brought against Ms. Safarian is not known.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt According to available information, Ms. Safarian and two
    other individuals accepted responsibility for all of the MKO s military
    operations in Khorramabad. (Women s Commission website). Defense Ms.
    Safarian defended the ideals of her Organization. (Women s Commission
    website). Judgment Khorramabad Islamic Revolutionary Court sentenced Ms.
    Mania Safarian to death. She was hanged in Khorramabad on October 15, or
    19, 1981. There is another report to the effect that she and two other
    people were strangled using metal wires. Ms. Safarian was buried at
    Khorramabad Cemetery. Her family was not allowed to inscribe her name on
    her grave. -------------------- *The exclusion of MKO members from
    government offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses,
    in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a
