    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Hassan Tavaf, son of Ali, along with
    three others, was published in the (Kayhan) newspaper on September 26,
    1981, quoting a statement by the Public Relations Office of the General
    Public Prosecutor s Office. The defendant s names and charges were
    published in this statement. Additional information is based on an
    electronic form, sent to Omid by a person familiar with his case. This
    execution was also reported in an addendum to the (Mojahed) magazine (No,
    261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups,
    who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic
    security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    According to the electronic form, Mr. Mohammad Hassan Tavaf, 19, was born
    and resided in Rasht. He was single, a senior high school student, and a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He was born into a
    religious middle-class family, as the first child, and became an
    intelligent boy with a good reputation. He participated in the 1979
    revolution and was an active member of the Revolutionary Committees in
    Rasht. However, after witnessing disreputable individuals in those
    institutions and their deviation from the revolution s aspirations, he
    left and joined the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He was talented in
    calligraphy, painting, and other arts. Mr. Tavaf was first arrested by
    Hezbollah, in Rasht, during a demonstration by Mojahedin for the
    anniversary of the revolution in February of 1981. A person named Farshid
    Abazari struck Mr. Tavaf s head with a dagger. He was transferred to a
    hospital due to his severe injury. Then doctors and nurses helped him to
    escape the hospital. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary,
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a split in the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released, along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention According to the electronic form, Mr.
    Tavaf was arrested at the Rashtian Quarter in Rasht on May 1, 1981, around
    noon. He was transferred to the Revolutionary Guards prison where he had
    visitations until June 20th. On this day, his mother went to the
    Revolutionary Court to ask about his situation. She was arrested, along
    with other mothers who had gone to the court, and was detained for a
    while. Trial According to the electronic form, Mr. Tavaf had no access to
    an attorney, and his trial was not open to the public. However, according
    to the statement by the Public Relations Office of the General Public
    Prosecutor s Office, the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Rasht issued the
    ruling against Mr. Tavaf and three others. No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges The Public Relations Office of the General
    Public Prosecutor s Office announced the charges against Mr.
    Mohammadhassan Tavaf and three others as armed uprising against the
    Islamic Republic regime; participation in street fights and clashes;
    membership and active support of the Mojahedin; protecting the
    organization s data; and approving all policies of the Mojahedin,
    including armed struggle, explosions, and assassinations. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    According to the electronic form, no evidence was provided against Mr.
    Tavaf. Defense No information is available on Mr.Tavaf 's defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Rasht identified Mr.
    Mohammadhassan Tavaf as Mofsed (corr
