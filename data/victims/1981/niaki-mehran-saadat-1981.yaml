    Mr. Mehran Sa adat Niaki is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear
    on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This
    list contains the names of those members of the organization who died
    after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this
    list have been executed. Additional information was obtained from an
    electronic form sent by a relative of the defendant to the Omid site, as
    well Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interview (ABC interview) with an
    informed source on July 26, 2018. According to the electronic form, Mr.
    Mehran Sa adat Niaki, son of Mohammad Reza, was born to a middle-class
    family in Amol in 1959. He was single and a radiology student. He had
    three brothers and one sister. He was a down-to-earth young man with a
    simple lifestyle who looked the part of a guerilla. He spent his summers
    among the people in the company of his friends in the summer home areas of
    Mazandaran, and helped locals with tasks such as gardening. He took part
    in the everyday laboring of people, wanting to become close to them. He
    spent a great deal of time with children and youth, and wanted to
    encourage them to think and not waste their time. He lived in student
    housing with a few of his friends. Ali Reza, one of his brothers, was
    executed by firing squad in Evin prison on September 16, 1981. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state, believed that China
    had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed
    all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Sa adat Niaki was arrested in Mashhad, but the circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Sa adat Niaki s trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Sa adat Niaki is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Sa adat Niaki. Defense No information is available on Mr. Sa
    adat Niaki s defense. Judgment Mr. Mehran Sa adat Niaki was put to death
    in a mass firing squad execution on December 2, 1981 at the Revolutionary
    Guards prison in Noshahr. According to an informed source, he and a number
    of other of those killed were buried in a common mass grave in the Noshahr
    prison yard. A year after Mr. Sa adat Niaki s execution, a Revolutionary
    Guard by the name of Khalaj showed the grave to his father (ABC
    interview).
