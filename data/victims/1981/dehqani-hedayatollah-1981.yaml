    Mr. Dehqani was a reputable businessman and an active member of the Baha
    is organizations. News of the execution of Mr. Hedayatollah Dehqani (also
    spelled " Hidayatu'llah Dihqani") , son of Soghra and Nasrollah, was
    submitted to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center through electronic form on
    March 17, 2020, by a person close to him. (Electronic form). News of this
    execution and that of one other individual was also published in Kayhan
    and Jomhuri-e Eslami newspapers on March 18, 1981, quoting an announcement
    by the city of Shiraz Islamic Revolutionary Court. Additional information
    about this case was obtained from Ettela at newspaper (August 19, 1980),
    his child s Facebook post (March 17, 2016), Martyrs of the Baha i Faith
    website (March 6, 2013), and from Mr. Mehrak Kamali s article entitled
    Baha is and Execution after the Revolution (June 19, 2019). Mr.
    Hedayatollah Dehqani was one of the 206 individuals whose name was
    published in the Worldwide Baha i Community s 1999 report. This report,
    entitled The Baha i Question: Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction
    of a Religious Community , dealt with the persecution of members of the
    Baha i faith in Iran by the Islamic Republic, and contained a list of Baha
    is who were killed in Iran since 1979. Mr. Dehqani was born in a Baha i
    family in the town of Abadeh s Kushkak village in Fars Province. He was
    married and had six children. Mr. Dehqani had a high school diploma and
    was engaged in trade and agriculture. He was a reputable businessman and
    an active member of the Baha is organizations. Mr. Dehqani was the head of
    Abadeh County s Baha i Spiritual Assembly. He was the head of the village
    and respected by all the people. His friends have said that his vast
    knowledge of [Baha i legal tenets], phenomenal memory, sense of humor, way
    with words, and kindness were among his main character traits. The Baha is
    in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979*- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them
    of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.** Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to
    the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention Mr. Dehqani was arrested
    in [the town of] Abadeh at 5 o clock in the afternoon on August 8, 1980,
    by Abadeh County Revolutionary Guards Corps. Three other Baha is from
    Abadeh County were arrested along with him. (Ettela at newapaper, August
    19, 1980). Mr. Dehqani spent 7 months and 9 days in detention at Shiraz
    Adelabad Prison. He spent 2 days at the Abadeh County jail, three days at
    the Revolutionary Guards interrogation center, and the rest of his
    incarceration at Shiraz Adelabad Prison. He was allowed visitation with
    his family six days after his arrest, and thereafter, the family visited
    him once a week from behind a glass window through the phone. (Electronic
    form). Trial Shiraz Islamic Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Dehqani. He was
    denied access to an attorney. No information is available about the
    details of the trial session(s). Charges The charges brought against Mr.
    Dehqani were contact with Colonel Vahdat (Colonel Vahdat was a deputy
    member of the Kushkak Baha i Spiritual Assembly) and cooperating in
    converting Moslems into Baha is and perverting and misleading uninformed
    individuals, especially villagers; contacting 250 village heads, sheriffs,
    and leaders of Fars region tribes and recording government officials phone
    conversations; intimidating Baha is who had found the path of
    righteousness in Islam; being active in Abadeh s Baha i [Spiritual]
