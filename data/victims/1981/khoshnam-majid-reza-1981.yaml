    News of the execution of Mr. Majid Reza Khoshnam, son of Reza, along with
    fourteen others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August
    31, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central Public
    Prosecutor’s Office announced these executions, the defendants’ names and
    their charges, and released it to the press. This execution was also
    announced in the Peykar publication, number 120, dated September 29, 1981.
    Moreover, Mr. Khoshnam is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on
    the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Additionally, Mr. Khoshnam is one of the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The communiqué of the
    Public Relations Department of the Central Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor’s Office states: “Hail to the fighters of the war against the
    world infidels under the leadership of blood-thirsty America, and hail to
    the heroic and martyr-producing nation, which obstruct criminals and
    merciless Hypocrites, and which reports these criminals against the Koran
    and Islam to the armed forces and the judiciary on a daily basis, and
    which accepts the calling of the Koran that ‘O Prophet, strive hard
    against the unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and be firm against them’” [9:
    73]. According to the Peykar magazine, Mr. Khoshnam was a member of a
    group called “Fighters for Workers’ Ideals.” This group later joined the
    Peykar Organization and Mr. Khoshnam worked in the Central Publication of
    the latter. His brother, Mr. Hamid Reza Khoshnam was also executed in
    1981. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention According to the Peykar , Mr. Khoshnam was
    arrested during a coordinated attack by the Islamic Regime’s agents on the
    publication and other centers of the Peykar Organization. The exact
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges In the
    communiqué of the Public Relations Department of the Central Revolutionary
    Public Prosecutor’s Office, the collective charges against Mr. Khoshnam
    and 5 other individuals were announced as: “a) Being in charge of the
    Publication and Distribution Committee for internal use [in the Peykar
    Organization] under the cover of two lithographic companies called Azar
    and Technofine; b) Armed robbery from Melli Bank on Salsabil [street in
    Tehran, now renamed Rudaki] and stealing the salaries in of the employees
    of General Motors in Karaj; c) Living in safe-houses in order to plan for
    assassinations and overthrow of the Islamic Republic.” Moreover, fifteen
    defendants including Mr. Khoshnam, were charged with “working full-time,
    professionally, and secretively for the hellish Organization and received
    salary.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Khoshnam’s defense. Judgment
    َThe Central Islamic Revolutionary Court called Mr. Majid Reza Khoshnam
    “at war with God, corruptor on earth and a rebel” and condemned him to
    death. He was shot by a firing squad on August 29, 1981. He was 22 years
    old.
