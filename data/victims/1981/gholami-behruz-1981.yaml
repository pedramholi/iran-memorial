    News of the execution of Mr. Behruz Gholami, son of Hossein, along with 22
    others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on November 12, 1981. The
    Public Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor’s Office
    announced these executions, the defendants' names and their charges, and
    released it to the media. News of the execution of Mr. Behruz Gholami and
    his will were also published in the book "Az Armani Ke Mijushad", a
    publication of ex-sympathizers of the Peykar Organization in August of
    1985. Mr. Behruz Gholami is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear
    on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This
    list contains the names of those members of the organization who died
    after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this
    list have been executed. Mr. Behruz Gholami is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention According to the will of Mr. Behruz Gholami, he was
    identified and arrested during an attack on the Peykar Organization in
    Tabriz. The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    The charges against Mr. Behruz Gholami were announced as, "armed uprising
    against the Islamic Republic, distribution of announcements and
    publication for the Peykar Organization, apostate, and frequenting in the
    organization's houses." These charges were announced for nine sympathizers
    of Peykar collectively. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Behruz Gholami's
    defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz condemned Mr.
    Behruz Gholami to death. The ruling was carried out in Tabriz on November
    9, 1981. No exact information is available about the details of the court
    verdict.
