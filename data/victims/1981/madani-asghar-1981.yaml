    News of the execution of Mr. Asghar Madani, son of Abolqasem, and 7 other
    individuals, was published in Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on Wedenesday,
    August 19, 1981, and in Kayhan newspaper on Thursday, August 20, 1981. The
    text of the communiqu containing the news of their execution, their
    identities and the charges brought against them, was provided to Pars News
    Agency by the Islamic Republic of Iran Revolutionary Prosecutor General s
    Office. Mr. Madani is also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Mr. Ahmad Hafezi was also arrested in connection
    with this group but committed suicide prior to being interrogated. Based
    on the communiqu of the Islamic Republic of Iran Revolutionary Prosecutor
    General s Office, the Qom Revolutionary Tribunal announced the names of
    Mr. Madani and seven others who had been active and effective members and
    cronies of the Hypocrites (derogatory term used by the Islamic Republic to
    describe the MKO) Qom branch and had been arrested with the extremely
    effective cooperation of Qom s Moslem, [vigilant], and ever present [in
    the political, social, and cultural arenas] population, and had been tried
    in the court of Islamic Justice and meted out divine punishment for their
    shameful and inhuman acts, in order to serve as a lesson in prudence and
    thinking [before taking action] to others. Based on available information,
    Mr. Madani was a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. Arrest and detention Based on the Islamic Republic of Iran
    Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office s communiqu , Mr. Madani and 8
    other individuals were arrested in the city of Qom. Details of the
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Based on
    available information, the Qom Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Madani and 7
    other individuals. Charges According to the announcement of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor General s Office, Mr. Asghar Madani s charges
    were stated as being establishing the Hypocrites (derogatory term used by
    the Islamic Republic to describe the MKO) Organization s central core in
    [the city of] Qom, planning and organizing the June 20 anti-masses
    demonstrations and inciting the participants to fight the people, even if
    it resulted in the murder of an innocent person, planning the bombing of
    the residences and the assassination of Qom s [important] personalities,
    including the plan to bomb Jame e-ye Modaressin-e Hoze-ye Elmiyeh-e Qom (
    Teachers Society of Qom s Seminary ) and the assassination of said
    teachers, conducting secret meetings, participating in street skirmishes
    resulting in injury to and the martyrdom of a number of innocent citizens.
