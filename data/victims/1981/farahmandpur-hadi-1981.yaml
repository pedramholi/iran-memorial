    News of the execution of Mr. Hadi Farahmandpur, son of Fathollah, along
    with three others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    November 18, 1981. He was from Sanandaj. Mr. Hadi Farahmandpur is one of
    the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on
    the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr. Hadi
    Farahmandpur is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Hadi Farahmandpur were announced as, "cooperation with
    the Mohareb (fighter) and anti-God organization of Peykar, distribution of
    announcements, and writing slogans for the organization." The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Hadi Farahmandpur's defense. Judgment َThe Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Sanandaj condemned Mr. Hadi Farahmandpur to death
    and the ruling was carried out on November 17, 1981. No specific
    information is available about the defendant’s execution.
