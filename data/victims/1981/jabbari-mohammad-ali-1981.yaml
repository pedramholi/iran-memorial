    The news of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Jabbari and 37 other
    individuals was announced in a communiqu by the Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office published in Kayhan and Jomhouri Eslami
    newspapers on August 8, 1981. According to this communiqu , Mr. Ali
    Jabbari was a well-known member of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    in Qazvin, and he had been a candidate in the first parliamentary election
    after the Revolution. This communiqu referred to the executed individuals
    as blood-thirsty hacks of the American grouplet, the Hypocrites. Mr.
    Mohammad Ali Jabbari, industrial worker, married, and an MKO supporter, is
    also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Ali Jabbari s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial According to the Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office communiqu the sentences for Mr. Ali
    Jabbari and 37 other individuals were handed down during a one-week
    period. No detailed information is available on Mr. Ali Jabbari s trial.
    Charges The Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office communiqu
    announced Mr. Ali Jabbari s charges as follows: Active and energetic
    member [of the MKO], member of the Hypocrites cadre and responsible for
    supplies, and a well-known and a subversive member of the organization in
    Qazvin. This communiqu also referred to all executed individuals as
    God-less apostates Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Ali
    Jabbari. Defense According to the Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor
    s Office communiqu the court heard the last defenses of the defendants. No
    detailed information, however, is available on Mr. Ali Jabbari s defense.
    Judgment The Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Ali
    Jabbari to death. He was executed by a firing squad on August 7, 1981. He
    was 26 years old at the time of his execution. *The exclusion of MKO
    members from government offices and the closure of their centers and
    publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities
    different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two.
    Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and
    the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin
    sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while distributing
    publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20,
    1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their treatment by
    governmental officials and the government officials efforts to impeach
    their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact that the
    regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets,
    some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The
    number of casualties that resulted from this demonstration is unknown but
    a large number of demonstrators were arrested and executed in the
    following days and weeks. The day after the demonstration, the Islamic
    Republic regime started a repressive campaign unprecedented in modern
    Iranian history.
