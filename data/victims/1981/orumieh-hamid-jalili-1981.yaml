    The information about Mr. Hamid Jalili Orumieh is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs in the Path to Freedom , copryright 1988 by the Rah-e Kargar
    Publications. He was born in Orumieh and graduated from the Tehran
    Polytechnic College. In 1976, he was arrested for political activities and
    released two months later. After the revolution, he joined the Rah-e
    Kargar Organization and was active in the southern quarter of Tehran. This
    execution was also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) in 1985. The list
    includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. "Rah-e
    Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was
    established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They introduced themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Arrest and detention According to the book, Mr. Jalili Orumieh
    was arrested in Tehran on November 24, 1981. He was taken to the Evin
    Prison. He was reportedly tortured severely while in detention. The source
    quotes an ex-prisoner saying: "His right hand was totally paralyzed due to
    the use of Dastbande Qapani (a type of handcuff that attaches both hands
    in the back. The intense pressure usually breaks the shoulder bones. For
    more severe results, they then hang the prisoner by his hands.) His legs
    were also injured severely." He was denied visitation with his family and
    access to an attorney. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Jalili
    Orumieh’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains
    no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available about the defendant’s defence. Judgment No specific information
    is available about the defendant’s execution. Mr. Jalili Orumieh was
    executed by a firing squad in the Evin Prison on January 26, 1982.
