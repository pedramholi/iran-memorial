    News of the execution of Mr. Malek Ajdar Qassabi Sareskandar Rud, and his
    will, were published in the Peykargar publication (publication of the
    Peykargar Student Union in West Berlin, No. 1, August 10, 1983). He is one
    of the 430 “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of 400 members and sympathizers of the organization who
    have been executed. Mr. Qassabi Sareskandar Rud is also among the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Malekajdar Qassabi Sareskandar Rud was arrested on
    August 16, 1981. Trial Mr. Malekajdar Qassabi Sareskandar Rud was tried on
    December 5, 1981. Charges In his will, Mr. Qassabi Sareskandar Rud has
    written that he was charged with “defending Marxism-Leninism as a science
    for liberation of the working class and all hard working people of the
    world, and defending the children of workers, farmers, and the
    disadvantaged.” Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Qassabi Sareskandar Rud’s
    defense. Judgment Mr. Qassabi Sareskandar Rud’s will is dated December 7,
    1981. He was executed by firing squad in Tabriz. He was 26 years old.
