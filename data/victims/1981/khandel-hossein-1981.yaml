    Khandel was born on May 2, 1943 in the city of Hamedan. He had a high
    school diploma and was a businessman. Mr. Khandel was known as a kind,
    caring, modest, honest, and trustworthy person. He always took on tough
    tasks and responsibilities; that was why his friends had labelled him
    Hamedan s Baha i community s monkey wrench . Prior to residing in the city
    of Hamedan, he had gone to one of Hamedan s villages to promote the Baha i
    faith, when he was forced to leave because of harassment by the region s
    residents. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran; Baha i News; Iran
    Wire; Gooya News; Baha i Martyrs). Mr. Khandel was married, with children.
    (Baha i News). He was a member of Hamedan s Spiritual Assembly**.
    (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran). In the summer of 1979, Mr.
    Khandel was arrested for his proselytizing activities in the youth
    department of Hamedan s Spiritual Assembly, and spent some time in
    detention. (Baha i Martyrs). This case is related to the arrest of 7
    members of the Hamedan s Baha i Spiritual Assembly in 1980. The Baha is in
    the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The Baha i religious community is
    the largest minority group in Iran, with approximately 300,000 members in
    1979 (more current figures are not available).*** The authorities of the
    Islamic Republic have subjected Baha is religious to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence. **** Arrest and
    detention Mr. Khandel was arrested on August 9, or 10, 1980, on an arrest
    warrant issued by the Revolutionary Court, and was temporarily released on
    August 11, and told to return in three days. Before the end of the 3-day
    period, however, he and several other members of the Hamedan Baha i
    Spiritual Assembly were arrested on August 12, 1980, by members of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran Revolutionary Guards Corps. (Iran Wire). Mr.
    Khandel spent 21 days at the Revolutionary Guards detention center and was
    subsequently transferred to the Police Force prison. He endured physical
    torture during detention. Mr. Khandel was denied visitations for 3 months
    after his arrest. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran). His and his
    co-defendants cell was located next to the ward toilets and was so small
    that they had to take turns sleeping. According to handwritten notes
    obtained from one of the co-defendants, they were incarcerated in a dirty
    and polluted environment and were deprived of the most basic health and
    hygiene requirements, including showering . According to this person, in
    order to combat lice and other pollutants, they used [bleach, detergents,]
    and heavy duty chemical cleansers multiple times a day. (Iran Wire). Mr.
    Khandel s and his co-defendants families wrote numerous letters to Iran s
    government officials and judicial authorities in order to have them lift
    their visitation ban. According to the families of Mr. Khandel s
    co-defendants, the prison guards did not allow the prisoners and their
    families to speak to one another in their first visitation. Mr. Khandel
    and his ward mates were allowed two visitations per week with their
    families. (Iran Wire). According to the spouse of one of Mr. Khandel s
    co-defendants, in the first two weeks of visitations, only the prisoners
    children were permitted to visit with their fathers; thereafter, their
    spouses were allowed visitation as well.
