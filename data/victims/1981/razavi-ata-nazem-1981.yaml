    The information about Ms. Ata Nazem Razavi, daughter of Abolfat h, has
    been drawn from an interview with a person close to her. Her execution
    along with twenty-two others, was published in the Kayhan and Jomhuri
    Eslami newspapers on July 7, 1981 (her name is mistakenly reported to be
    Atieh). The Public Relations Department of the Public Prosecutor s Office
    issued an announcement concerning these executions, the defendants names,
    and their charges, and released it to the news agencies. She is also is
    one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of
    the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published
    on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. Her name (also mistakenly published
    as Atieh) is mention among the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Additionally, the Peykar
    publication, number 122, published on October 12, 1981 mentions her as
    well. Ms. Nazem-Razavi was born in Kashan in 1955. She was a member of the
    editorial board of the journal Peyke-Kargar and a member of the Central
    Cell of sympathizers of the Peykar Organization in Kashan. She was also a
    teacher in the Ministry of Education and specialist in the education of
    children with special needs. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention Ms.
    Nazem-Razavi was arrested in Kashan on June 28, 1981. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The Public Relations
    Department of the Central Public Prosecutor s Office announced the charges
    against Ms. Nazem-Razavi as, "action against Islam and Moslems, rioting,
    disturbance, misleading small and ignorant students, and being apostate."
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Nazem-Razavi's defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kashan identified Ms. Ata Nazem-Razavi as
    "an enemy of God, a corruptor on earth, and a rebel." She was executed in
    Evin prison on July 5, 1981.
