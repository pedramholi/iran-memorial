    The information about Mr. Bahman Sepasi, son of Ali Akbar, is based on an
    interview by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with his brother and an
    electronic form sent to Omid by him. According to this information, he was
    born in Rasht in 1954. He was single and graduated from Aryamehr (Sherif)
    University in 1979. His last semester coincided with the revolution, when
    he was among those who wrote articles about daily political issues of the
    day, printed them on large papers, and installed them on walls of the
    university for other students to read. Students had political debates
    about these articles. Mr. Sepasi s articles attracted some attention. But
    his political activities were limited to this and he had no affiliation
    with any organization. After the closure of universities, he had no
    activity and was considering marriage and moving outside Iran. Arrest and
    detention According to the interviewee, Mr. Sepasi was arrested in a
    Komiteh [revolutionary base] in the spring of 1982 when he was looking for
    his brother, Alireza Sepasi, who had disappeared for several days, in
    various institutions. Agents went to his house for a search while keeping
    him in a car. When Mr. Sepasi saw the interviewee, he signaled as if there
    was not an important issue. Since he had no political activities, his
    family expected him to be released. Mr. Sepasi was detained at the Evin
    Prison and had no visitations with his family. He was denied access to an
    attorney. Trial No information is available on Mr. Sepasi s trial.
    According to the interviewee, he was not tried. Charges No information is
    available on Mr. Sepasi s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Sepasi. Defense No information is available about Mr. Sepasi s
    defense. Judgment Mr. Bahman Sepasi was executed at the Evin Prison in
    Tehran two or three weeks after his arrest in the spring of 1982. When his
    parents went to the prison, authorities informed them of his execution and
    gave them his will. They did not reveal his burial location. Sometime
    later, however, they implied that he was buried at the Khavaran cemetery.
    His brother, Alireza Sepasi, was also executed during the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. On a visitation day, when Mr. Sepasi s
    parents went to the prison to visit Alireza and another imprisoned
    brother, a prison official told them that Bahman Sepasi was executed by
    mistake.
