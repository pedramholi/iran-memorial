    News of the execution of Mr. Seyed Hashem Karami, son of Abbas, along with
    eighteen others, was published in the Keyhan and Jomhuri Eslami newspapers
    on August 16, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Revolutionary
    Prosecution Office of Tehran issued an announcement about this execution
    and released it to the Pars news agency. Mr. Karami is one of the 430
    individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr. Karami is
    also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization on
    September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. The communiqué of the Revolutionary Prosecution Office,
    which calls the convicts “sworn agents of the superpowers”, begins with a
    reference to the Koran: “It is but a just recompense for those who make
    war on God and His apostle and endeavor to spread corruption on earth,
    that they are being slain in great numbers, or crucified in great numbers,
    or have, in result of their perverseness, their hands and feet cut off in
    great numbers, or are being [entirely] banished from [the face of] the
    earth: such is their ignominy in this world . But in the life to come [yet
    more] awesome suffering awaits them” [5:33]. The Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Karami are collective, vague, and include eighteen other
    defendants. In the communiqué of the Revolutionary Prosecution Office,
    there is no reference to a specific crime committed by any single
    defendant. The communiqué states that Mr. Karami was “an active member of
    the Student Section and a member of the Publications Committee for the
    Peykar Organization, which opposes our nation.” He and eighteen others
    were collectively charged with “attacking innocent people, assault and
    battery, murder, frequenting the safe houses, activities for overthrowing
    the Islamic Republic regime, planning to assassinate officials, intending
    to carry out plans for world imperialism headed by the US.” The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on the defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Karami to death. He was
    executed in Evin prison in Tehran on August 15, 1981.
