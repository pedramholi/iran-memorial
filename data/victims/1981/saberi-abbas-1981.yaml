    Mr. Abbas Saberi’s execution was reported in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) in
    1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Further information about Mr. Saberi is gathered from a book
    titled Siavoshan, “Remembrance of the Ranjbaran Party of Iran’s Martyrs”

    military service, he tried to leave Iran and go to other countries within
    the Middle East with people known as the Palestine Group. Though this plan
    was unsuccessful, he eventually escaped to Iraq. In Iraq he worked on
    Persian programs for Radio Iraq. In 1975 he went to Germany and got
    married there. In the fall of 1978, he secretly went back to Iran, but he
    was arrested after his return. However, due to the upheavals of the
    Revolution, he was released in the November of the same year. He was one
    of the leaders of the Ranjbaran Party in Khuzestan. Primarily the
    Ranjbaran Party consisted of the members of the Revolutionary Organization
    of Tudeh Party which was formed outside of Iran after the 1953 coup
    d’état. This organization was opposed to the Soviet Union and social
    imperialism. They were followers of Mao Tse-tung. Arrest and detention The
