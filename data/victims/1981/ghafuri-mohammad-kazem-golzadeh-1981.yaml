    The news of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Kazem Golzadeh Ghafuri, along
    with that of 60 others, was released by the Public Relations of the
    General Prosecutor’s Office in a communiqué published in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on October 6, 1981. He is also one of the 12028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Golzadeh Ghafuri’s brother,
    Mohammad Sadeq, and his sister, Maryam were also executed in the 1980’s.
    His father was a cleric, with a doctorate in law from Sorbonne University
    in Paris. He was elected a representative to the Majles (Parliament) but
    due to his disapproval of government’s policies, he gave up his political
    career (Ms. Mina Entezari’s weblog, in memory of Maryam Golzadeh Ghafuri).
    The communiqué of the General Prosecutor’s Office, which specifies that
    those executed were “members and sympathizers of the anti-people groups
    who had risen against Islam and the Qur’an,” begins as follows: “‘By
    purging the corruptors, clean the earth from corruption’ (The Qur’an).
    Those who have not embraced faith and are combating in an idolatrous path
    are forming rank against pious people, and, by martyring the best and
    purest men, are attesting to the fact that they are mercenaries of the
    great powers. It is the duty of you pious men to stand up against them and
    uproot infidelity and hypocrisy.” Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The General
    Prosecutor's Office specifies the charges brought against this defendant
    as follows: "It must be noted that Mohammad Kazem Golzadeh Ghafuri was
    directly involved in the attack against the Majlis [parliament] during
    which he had opened fire on the revolutionary guards in charge of the
    Majlis shuraye Eslami. He was an active member of the military teams of
    the Monafeqin [Hypocrites, term used by the Islamic Republic authorities
    when referring to the People’s Mojaheddin Organization] and had also a
    role in the unsuccessful assassination attempt on Mr. Hojatolesalm
    Khaz'ali and Hojatoleslam Musavi Tabrizi, the General Prosecutor of the
    Revolution." The communiqué notes that all the other defendants were
    members and sympathizers of groups that it does not identify but refers to
    as “anti-people groups.” The charges against these groups, as specified in
    the communiqué, are as follows: "[rising] against Islam and the Qur'an by
    participating in armed demonstrations and clashes with the Revolutionary
    Guards, imposing martyrdom on people who are faithful to the revolution,
    being present in safe houses, identifying and assassinating known clerics
    and state dignitaries, carrying arms and grenades to oppose defenseless
    people, taking action in order to blow up various centers, and being
    involved in armed carjacking and bank robberies." Evidence of guilt The
    statement issued by the Prosecutor’s Office does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on the accused’s defense. Judgment Based on the
    Public Prosecutor’s Office communiqué, the defendant was sentenced to
    death for being “rebellious against Islam”, “an enemy of God”, and “a
    corruptor on earth.” The sentence was carried out at dawn in the courtyard
    of the Prison.
