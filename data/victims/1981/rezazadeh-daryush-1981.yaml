    The information about Mr. Daryush Rezazadeh, son of Reza, has been drawn
    from an interview with a family member. His execution, along with that of
    14 other individuals, was announced in the Kayhan newspaper No. 11340
    dated July 22, 1981. The Public Relations department of the Public
    Prosecution Office released the names and charges of the convicted
    individuals to the media. Mr. Rezazadeh is one of the 430 individuals
    whose name appears on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. The Peykar magazine, the main publication of the Peykar
    Organization, wrote about Mr. Rezazadeh’s execution in No. 121, dated
    October 5, 1981. He also is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The Rezazadeh family was not religious, and they
    opposed the monarchy. Daryush’s father used to be a sympathizer of the
    Tudeh Party. He had a photography store and refused to put up the flag of
    the monarchy at his shop. After the Revolution, the family opposed the
    Islamic Republic. Born in Tabriz in 1957, Mr. Rezazadeh went to school
    there and he earned his master’s degree in industrial design from Tabriz
    University. He was a very quiet person. He was engaged, and he and his
    fiancée loved each other very much. Mr. Rezazadeh began his political
    activism during the Revolution and joined the Peykar Organization. He was
    later transferred to Tehran and continued his activities in the
    publication section of the Organization. His 15-year-old sister was also
    arrested in 1981 for sympathizing with the Peykar Organization and she was
    in prison for 5 years. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention In June
    or July of 1981, the Revolutionary Guards raided the house where Mr.
    Rezazadeh and a few others worked on the publication of the Peykar
    magazine. The Guards arrested them and brought them to Evin prison. He and
    his colleagues were detained for only a few days. His arrest was not
    announced to his family members (interview). Trial No information is
    available on the trial. Charges The Public Prosecution Office did not
    release the charges brought against Mr. Rezazadeh to the media. Evidence
    of guilt The report of this execution does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on his defense. Judgment In accordance with the
    verdict of the Central Revolutionary Tribunal, Mr. Daryush Rezazadeh was
    executed by a firing squad at Evin Prison in Tehran on July 22, 1981,
    along with 14 others. They were buried at Khavaran cemetery. The Rezazadeh
    family found out about his execution from the newspaper article. Daryush
    was 24. Agents of the Islamic Republic harassed family members from
    visiting the graves of their loved ones at Khavaran cemetery, and at times
    would not allow them to enter the cemetery. The Rezazadehs were no
    exception. Once in the 1980s, plain-clothes agents attacked the cars
    parked at the entrance to the cemetery. They completely destroyed the top
    of Daryush’s father’s car. The Khavaran cemetery was completely destroyed
    in 2009.
