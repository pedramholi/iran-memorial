    The execution of Mojtaba Zargari and 14 other individuals was announced in
    the Kayhan newspaper on July 22, 1981. He is one also of the 430
    individuals whose name appears on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Peykar Andeesheh. This execution was also announced in the
    addendum of the Mojahed magazine (Sep. 6, 1985), and the Peykar magazine
    (Sep. 14, 1981). According to the Peykar magazine, Mr. Zargari was born in
    1958. In 1978 he enrolled in the Bsuiness School. One year later, he
    joined the Revolutionary Guards Corps due to his religious convictions and
    excitement about the Revolution, however soon he left the Corps. He was a
    sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to Peykar , Mr. Zargari was arrested on July 10, 1981. No other
    information is available on his arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The Public Prosecution
    Office did not release the charges brought against Mr. Zargari to the
    media. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on the defense. Judgment In accordance with
    the verdict of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal, Mr. Mojtaba
    Zargari was executed by a firing squad at Evin Prison in Tehran on July
    22, 1981. He was 23 years old.
