    News of the execution of Mr. Mehdi Pusti, son of Abbas, along with 25
    others, was published by Kayhan and Jomhuri-e Eslami newspapers on October
    10, 1981, quoting a communiqu from the Public Relations Department of the
    General Public Prosecutor s Office. News of the executions, names, and
    charges against defendants are reflected in this communiqu . Additional
    information is based on an electronic form sent to Omid by a person
    familiar with this case. Mr. Mehdi Pusti is one of the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to Mojahed magazine (No. 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. According to the existing
    information, Mr. Mehdi Pusti, 18, was born in Esfahan in 1963. He was
    single, a high school student, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary,
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam to be their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology.
    In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were
    imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a split within the
    Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the
    imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along with other
    political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to recruit new
    members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    primary in the organization s agenda. During the first two years after the
    Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic s leaders. * Arrest and detention According to an
    electronic form, Mr. Mehdi Pusti was arrested at Ahmadabad in Esfahan. He
    was detained and interrogated at the Esfahan Intelligence Prison in
    Kamalesma il Street. He was detained in solitary confinement. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Pusti s trial. According to the communiqu
    from the Public Relations Department of the General Public Prosecutor s
    Office, the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Esfahan condemned Mr. Pusti and
    25 others to death. According to the electronic form, he was not tried.
    Charges According to the communiqu from the Public Relations Department of
    the General Public Prosecutor s Office, the charges against Mr. Pusti and
    25 others were collectively announced to have supported, armed acts
    against the Islamic Republic regime in Iran; membership in team houses;
    participation in military teams; throwing grenades and Molotov cocktails;
    robbery of motorcycles and car plates for assassination of Revolutionary
    Guards; forging stamps for marriage certificates and identification cards;
    and set fire to cars belonging to official institutions and Muslims and
    responsible individuals. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Pusti. Defense No information is available on Mr. Pusti s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Esfahan identified Mr. Mehdi
    Pusti as Baghi [rebel] and Mofsed [corruptor on Earth], and condemned him
    to death. The ruling was carried out on October 7, 1981, and he was
    executed by firing squad at the Esfahan Intelligence Prison. Mr. Pusti was
    only 18 years old. _________________________ * The exclusion of MKO
    members from government offices and the closure of their centers and
    publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities
    different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two.
    Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and
    the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin
    sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while distributing
    publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters. On June 20,
    1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their treatm
