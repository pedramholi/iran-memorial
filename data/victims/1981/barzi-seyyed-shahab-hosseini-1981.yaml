    The information about the execution of Mr. Seyyed Shahab Hosseini Barzi, a
    follower of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, and 80 other individuals was
    released in a communiqué of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal,
    published in the newspaper Kayhan , September 20, 1981. Moreover,
    information regarding this case was sent to Omid via an electronic form by
    a person who does not wish to be identified. Mr. Hosseini Barzi is also
    one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Arrest and
    detention Based on the information available on the form, a former
    cellmate of Mr. Hosseini Barzi recalls that Mr. Hosseini Barzi was taken
    to a cell at the Evin Prison in 1981 and spent only a few hours in
    detention before being executed. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges According to the communiqué, Mr. Hosseini Barzi
    was accused of "being present in team houses, armed robbery, having guns,
    walkie-talkies, and Molotov cocktails, shooting into a crowd, being a
    member of the armed guerrilla organization, setting fire to different
    centers including the treasury." These charges are collective and brought
    against the defendant and 17 of the 81 individuals. The prosecution does
    not mention any specific offense for the defendant. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Hosseini Barzi's defense. Judgment Mr. Hosseini Barzi was
