    The information about Mr. Jebra’il Hashemi Azar is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism by Rah-e Kargar Publications. He was
    born in a small village near Ardebil. During the previous regime, when he
    was a student, he was arrested twice. The last time, he was tried and
    condemned to life imprisonment for his affiliation with the Fedaiyan Khalq
    Organization. After the Revolution, he joined the Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran, Rah-e Kargar in 1979. During the “Cultural
    Revolution” and the purges of the universities, he was shot by the
    Revolutionary Guards and was severely injured. Two operations were
    performed on him. After being in the hospital for months, and being
    watched carefully by Revolutionary Guards, he escaped in spite of being
    extremely weak. The Cultural Revolution began after Ayatollah Khomeini
    gave a speech in March 1980 and ordered that the universities be purged of
    all those in opposition to his regime and be transformed into “learning
    environments” [as opposed to political forums] where “an all-Islamic
    curriculum” is taught. The first wave of violence began on April 15, 1980
    during a speech by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of
    the Islamic Revolution and Minister of Interior] at the University of
    Tabriz. Following that speech, students supporting the regime took control
    of the University’s central building and demanded that the “university be
    purged” from “pro-Shah elements and other sellouts.” On April 18th, the
    Council of the Islamic Revolution issued a communiqué accusing political
    groups of converting higher education institutions into “headquarters of
    discordant political activities” and named them obstacles to the radical
    transformation of the universities. The communiqué gave these groups three
    days (Saturday April 19 to Monday April 21) to discontinue and shut down
    their activities in the universities. The Council stressed that the
    decision included libraries along with activities related to arts and
    sports Serious clashes took place between leftist opposition groups and
    Islamic associations, supported by security forces and paramilitary
    groups, before the end of the Council’s deadline. The former, which
    recruited members and had strong support in the universities, refused to
    evacuate. These clashes, which peaked at the end of the three-day
    deadline, resulted in the death of several people and the wounding of
    hundreds of others on university campuses around the country. On April 21,
    the Islamic Republic authorities announced the victory of the Cultural
    Revolution and the closure of all universities in order to Islamicize the
    curricula. The universities remained closed for two years. One of the
    outcomes of the Cultural Revolution was the purging of many university
    professors and students based on their political beliefs. “Rah-e Kargar”
    or the “Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran” was established in the
    summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various
    leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in
    political action. They identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists,
    promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat.
    They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they
    opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini’s leadership. Arrest
