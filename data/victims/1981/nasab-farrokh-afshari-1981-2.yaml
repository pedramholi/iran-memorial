    Mr. Farrokh Afshari Nasab, son of Ali, is one of the 430 individuals whose
    names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those members of the
    organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the
    individuals on this list have been executed. Further information about Mr.
    Afshari Nasab was sent to the Boroumand Foundation through an electronic
    form. The execution of Mr. Farrokh Afshari Nasab, along with 18 other
    individuals, was announced in a communiqué of the Public Relations of the
    Central Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office, and was published in the Keyhan
    and the Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on August 16, 1981. This communiqué,
    which calls the convicts “sworn agents of the superpowers”, begins with a
    reference to the Koran: “The punishment for those who fight against God
    and his Prophet and pursue the path of corruption and spread corruption on
    earth is to be harshly killed, or hanged, or that their hands and legs
    from opposite sides be amputated, or be exiled from the land. This brings
    them degradation and humiliation in this world; and painful and severe
    punishment awaits them in the world to come.” The Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “ocial imperialist”state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Afshari Nasab was arrested in Tehran. The circumstances of his arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges According to the Central Revolutionary
    Prosecutor’s Office, Mr. Afshari Nasab was charged with being “a high
    level member of the Communication and Financial department of the American
    Organization, Peykar, and in charge of communications among its Committees
    in different cities and other localities.” These personal charges against
    Mr. Afshari Nasab do not include the collective charges against all 19
    individuals executed on that date: “attacking innocent people, assault,
    battery and murder, living in safe houses, plotting to overthrow the
    Islamic Republic regime… conspiracy to assassinate officials and state
    authorities, intending to carry out plans for world imperialism, headed by
    America” as well as “being at war with God and his Prophet.” The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Afshari Nasab’s defense. Judgment
    According to the available information, the Central Islamic Revolutionary
    Court condemned Mr. Farrokh Afshari Nasab to death. He was executed by a
    firing squad in the Evin prison yard in Tehran on August 15, 1981.
