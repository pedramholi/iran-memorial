    Though those who took the life of Dr. Manuchehr Hakim did their best to
    erase his name from history, to this day, his legacy as an expert in
    anatomy, a professor, hospital manager and humanitarian continues to
    command respect. Information about the murder of Dr. Manuchehr (also
    spelled " Manuchihr") Hakim, son of Arastu Hakim, was obtained from an
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran s (ABC) interview
    with his son on June 15th, 2022 and a person familiar with the case on
    June 18th, 2022. Additionally, information was obtained from a letter
    written by Dr. Hakim s wife, Mrs. Germaine Landoy-Hakim, to numerous
    Iranian officials in February 1981, as well as documents published in the
    Archives for Baha i Persecution in Iran, the Baha i World (Volume 18,
    1979-1983, Haifa), Baha i News (Issue 378, Published by the National
    Spiritual Assembly of the Baha is of the United States in 1962 and Issue
    403, 1964) and an article titled Baha i Health Initiatives in Iran ; A
    Preliminary Survey (Fazel and Foadi, 2008). Dr. Manuchihr Hakim is also
    one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999 report published by the

    6 and August 9th, 2015), Sahifeye Noor (Volume 17, May 28, 1982) and the
    BBC Persian Website (October 11, 2015). Dr. Manuchehr Hakim was born in
    Tehran in 1910 (BW, Vol. 18). He attended a Baha i elementary and
    secondary school in Tehran before moving to France on a government grant
    to complete a nine year medical education with a specialization in
    anatomy. Later in his career he successfully passed the agr gation , a
    competitive examination for civil service in the French public education
    system. In 1938, he married and the couple had two children before Dr.
    Hakim returned to Iran to serve his two years of compulsory military
    service. During this time he established and chaired the Anatomy
    Department at the University of Tehran where he later taught for 30 years.
    Dr. Hakim, was renowned for his research in anatomy and work in
    gastroenterology. His books and writings are today standard practice in
    medical textbooks. In 1976 he was awarded the L gion d honneur by the
    French government for his humanitarian work. Dr. Hakim was one of the
    founding members of the Misaghieh Hospital in Tehran (founded in the early
    1950 s), which he managed for 31 years. Misaghieh was an independent
    hospital established and funded by the Baha i community, and the first of
    its kind to found affiliated institutions such as a nursing school, the
    Tehran Elderly Care Home and a polyclinic that treated patients free of

    Dr. Hakim was also a devout Baha i and highly regarded within the Baha i
    community. He was briefly a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of

    Assembly in Tehran on 21 August 1980, Dr. Hakim was vacationing in France.
    Though he had the option of staying away from the danger in France where
    his children lived, Dr. Hakim chose to return to Iran immediately, telling
    his family that he could not leave his fellow Baha is alone in such
    critical times (Interview, June 15th 2022 and June 18th 2022). Dr. Hakim
    was elected to the Second National Spiritual Assembly that replaced the
    first in 1980. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Bah
