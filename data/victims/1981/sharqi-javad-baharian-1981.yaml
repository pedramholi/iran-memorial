    The information about Mr. Javad Baharian Sharqi, son of Hossein, is based
    on an interview with one of his close relatives. His execution along with
    18 other individuals was released in a communiqué of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecution Office of Tehran, published in the Kayhan and
    the Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on August 16, 1981. This execution was also
    reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. Additionally, Mr. Baharian Sharqi is
    among the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of “Martyrs of
    the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class,”
    published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. Mr. Baharian Sharqi was
    born in Mashhad on July 27, 1955. He was a senior in the Tehran
    Polytechnic University and a member of the Peykar Organization. The
    communiqué of the Revolutionary Prosecution Office, which calls the
    convicts “sworn agents of the superpowers,” begins with a reference to the
    Koran, “It is but a just recompense for those who make war on God and His
    apostle and endeavor to spread corruption on earth, that they are being
    slain in great numbers, or crucified in great numbers, or have, in result
    of their perverseness, their hands and feet cut off in great numbers, or
    are being [entirely] banished from [the face of] the earth: such is their
    ignominy in this world. But in the life to come [yet more] awesome
    suffering awaits them” [5:33]. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation
    of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Baharian Sharqi was arrested while waiting for a comrade in the Emam
    Hossein Square on July 25, 1981. Three days later, his wife was also
    arrested in front of the campus dormitory. He was kept in the Ward 3000
    (formerly known as the Joint Anti-Sabotage Committee). During his
    detention, he was denied visitors. Trial The trial took place in Ward
    3000. According to the interviewee, the detainees of Ward 3000 were tried
    at the same place. Mr. Baharian Sharqi reportedly had a summary trial.
    Charges The communiqué of the Revolutionary Prosecution Office refers to
    Mr. Baharian Sharqi as an “active member of the student section of the
    Peykar Organization, which opposes the nation.” This communiqué also
    states that he and 18 others were collectively charged with “attacking
    innocent people, assault and battery, murder, frequenting the
    organization’s houses, activities aimed at overthrowing the Islamic
    Republic regime, planning to assassinate officials, intending to carry out
    plans for world imperialism, led by the US.” There is no mention of the
    personal charges brought against any single defendant. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Baharian Sharqi’s defense. He was denied the right to legal
    representation. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr.
    Baharian Sharqi to death. He was executed at dawn, on August 15, 1981, at
    Evin Prison. His family learnt of his execution through the media.
