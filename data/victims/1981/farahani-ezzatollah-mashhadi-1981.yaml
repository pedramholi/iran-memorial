    News of the execution of Mr. Ezzatollah Mashhadi Farahani, son of
    Asadollah, and 22 other individuals, was published in Kayhan newspaper and
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on Tuesday, August 18, 1981, quoting the
    communiqué of the Office of Public Relations of the Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office. The names and crimes of the accused
    have been stated in this communiqué. Mr. Mashhadi Farahani is also one of
    the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Based on available
    information, Mr. Mashhadi Farahani was a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members’ interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah’s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization’s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Mashhadi
    Farahani’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. According to the communiqué of the
    Office of Public Relations of the Central Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecutor’s Office, the Central Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Mashhadi
    Farahani and 22 other individuals. Charges The Office of Public Relations
    of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office has stated the
    charges brought against Mr. Mashhadi Farahani and 22 others as being
    “terrorism, destruction, bombing, attacking Revolutionary Guard and
    Committee brothers, participating in the terrorist and fascist affair of
    June 20, assaulting and injuring the Moslem people [of Iran], armed
    uprising against the Islamic Republic Regime.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mashhadi Farahani’s defense. Judgment The Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Court declared Mr. Ezzatollah Mashhadi Farahani and 22 other
    individuals “Mohareb with God and His Messenger” (“One who wages war with
    God and the Prophet Mohammad,”) and “Baqi against Islamic Rule” (“One who
    has turned against Islam and Islamic Rule”) and sentenced them to death.
    The sentence was carried out on Tuesday, August 16, 1981, and he was shot
    by a firing squad at Evin Prison. Mr. Mashhadi Farahani was 19 years old.
    *The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the closure of
    their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the Islamic
    Republic authorities’ different interpretation of Islam, widened the gap
    between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the Mojahedin
    as “Hypocrites” and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime attacked the
    Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and while
    distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO supporters.
    On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration protesting their
    treatment by governmental officials and the government officials’ efforts
    to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan Banisadr. Despite the fact
    that the regime called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the
    streets, some of whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and
    Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that resulted from this demons
