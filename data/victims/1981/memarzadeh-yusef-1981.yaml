    News of the execution of Mr. Yusef Me marzadeh, son of Abolfazl, is based
    on an electronic form sent to Omid by a person familiar with his case.
    Further information is gathered from a book titled Siavoshan, Remembrance
    of the Ranjbaran Party of Iran s Martyrs by Baqer Mortazavi 1999, Germany.
    This execution was also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No. 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups,
    who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic
    security forces, from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine.
    According to the existing information, Mr. Yusef Me marzadeh was born in
    Ardebil in July of 1960. He was a junior student of Metallurgy Engineering
    at the Science and Technology University in Tehran and head of the
    Ranjbaran Party of Iran in Ardebil. The Ranjbaran Party of Iran was
    established in Tehran by a number of Marxist groups and parties in late
    December 1979. The founders of Ranjbaran were Marxist Leninist and
    followers of Mao Tse-Tung s school of thought. They opposed the U.S.A. and
    the USSR and supported Ruhollah Khomeini as an anti-imperialist leader.
    During the massive repression of 1981, the party was banned, and its
    leaders were executed. Its publication, Ranjbar, has occasionally
    published outside Iran, since 1981. Arrest and detention According to the
    Siavoshan book, Mr. Me marzadeh was arrested while distributing the
    Ranjbarn Party s pamphlets. According to the electronic form report, he
    had no visitation rights, and, when his father repeatedly went to prison
    for visitation, officials told him that he could not visit a communist.

    information is available on Mr. Me marzadeh s charges. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution contains no evidence provided against Mr. Me
    marzadeh. Defense No information is available regarding Mr. Me marzadeh's

    September 18, 1981. According to the electronic form report, he was
    executed along with forty other cellmates.
