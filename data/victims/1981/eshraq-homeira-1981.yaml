    The news of the execution of Ms. Homeira Eshraq and 35 (in Kayhan ) and 48
    (in Jomhuri Eslami ) other individuals was released in a communiqué of the
    Central Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecutor’s Office, published in the
    Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami dailies on November 26, 1981. This execution was
    also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published
    by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) in 1985. The list includes 12028
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Additional information
    about Ms. Eshraq is taken from the MKO website. She was a MKO sympathizer.
    She worked with the "Nasle Enqelab" (Revolutionary Generation)
    publication. After the start of the Organization’s armed struggle, she
    became the commander of a high school student battalion. Arrest and
    detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and
    detention. According to the MKO website, Ms. Eshraq was arrested after the
    demonstration of June 20, 1981. She probably spent her five-month
    detention at the Evin prison. She was reportedly tortured so severely that
    she could not walk. The demonstration of June 20, 1981, was a protest
    against the parliament's impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic
    Republic's systematic policy of excluding the MKO from the country's
    political scene, as well as Ayatollah Khomeini’s refusal to meet with MKO
    leaders and his insistence to disarm them. Until then, the MKO had
    supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function
    within the framework of the new political system. On June 20, 1981, the
    MKO officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the regime by
    organizing mass demonstrations throughout the country . These
    demonstrations, which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing
    of dozens of demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and
    executions by the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that
    targeted not only the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive
    repression, unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic,
    legitimized the months-old state harassment and suppression of dissidents
    and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent political dissent.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to the communiqué of the Central Public Prosecutor’s Office, Ms.
    Eshraq was charged with “being the commander of a special operations unit
    in charge of sabotage and revolts in order to overthrow the Islamic
    regime.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available on Ms. Eshraq's defence. Judgment BBased on the information
    available in the Kayhan and the Jomhuri Eslami dailies, the Central
    Islamic Republic Court declared Ms. Eshraq a “corruptor, enemy and fighter
    against God” and sentenced her to death. She was executed by a firing
    squad at the Evin Prison on the dawn of November 25, 1981. However,
    according to the MKO website, Ms. Eshraq was executed by the firing squad
    in the Evin prison, while in a wheelchair, on November 26, 1981.
