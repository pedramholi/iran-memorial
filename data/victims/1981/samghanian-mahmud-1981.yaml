    The information about Mr. Mahmud Samghanian is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism by Rah-e Kargar Publications. He was
    born in Mashhad, and a high school graduate. He worked at the Qandeshirin
    factory in Mashhad. He was a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization until he joined the Revolutionary Workers Organization of
    Iran, Rah-e Kargar. He was active in the factory council and was fired
    when the council was dissolved. “Rah-e Kargar” or the “Revolutionary
    Workers Organization of Iran” was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They
    identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention The
    Revolutionary Guards arrested Mr. Mahmud Samghanian on the street in
    August, 1981. He was first detained in the Mashhad police prison, but then
    was taken to the Revolutionary Guard Prison. This book quotes a cellmate
    saying: “They kept him blindfolded for several weeks. They tortured him
    many times and hung him by his handcuffs for hours. In the end, they
    interrogated and tortured him for eight straight hours. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information
    is available on Mr. Mahmud Samghanian’s charges. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    According to the above source, after his arrest, the Revolutionary Guards
    searched his residence and found twenty copies of the latest publication
    of the Rah-e Kargar. Defense No information is available about his
    defense. Judgment No specific information is available about the execution
    sentence. Mr. Mahmud Samghanian was executed by a firing squad in Mashhad
    in late summer of 1981.
