    Ms. Farkhondeh Raja i is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were either executed or
    killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June
    20, 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Additional information
    about Ms. Farkhondeh Raja i was taken from the website of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. She was a university student majoring in pharmacy. She
    had joined the Mojahedin Organization after the 1979 Revolution and was
    active in the Muslim Student Association at the University of Tehran. Ms.
    Raja i had been injured in a demonstration, prior to the June 20, 1981
    demonstrations, but had managed to escape. The demonstrations on June 20,
    1981, took place in protest against the Parliament s efforts to dismiss
    the president Banisadr, the rejection of Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    candidates, and the prohibition of their participation in politics,
    Ayatollah Khomeini s decision not to meet with Mojahedin and his
    insistence for their disarmament. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization had
    supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and had tried to be a part
    of the new political system until June 20, 1981, when they changed their
    policy and tried to overthrow the regime by organizing mass demonstrations
    all over the country. The severe suppression of these demonstrations
    resulted in the killing of dozens as well as a wave of mass arrests and
    attacks by the Revolutionary Guards and militants groups that went on for
    months. The intensity of the suppression was unprecedented in the history
    of the Islamic Republic and became the official policy of the government.
