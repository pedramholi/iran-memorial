    affiliated with the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. After the 1979
    Revolution, the organization, which renounced armed struggle, split over
    their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The

    mainly in the political arena and the labor movement. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Majority) supported and considered the Islamic Republic as a
    revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime. After the spring of 1983,
    however, the Islamic Republic targeted the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority)
    members solely because of their political beliefs. Arrest and detention
