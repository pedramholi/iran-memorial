    The information about Mr. Ruzbeh Shakerifard, son of Mohammadali is based
    on an electronic form sent to Omid by a person familiar with his case.
    According to this information, he was born in 1959 in the city of Mashhad.
    He was single, a civil engineering student at Elm o San at ( Science and
    Industry ) University, a supporter of the Vahdat Enghelabi ( Revolutionary
    Union ) Organization, and an idealistic young man. His political activity
    consisted of selling leftist groups publications and participating in
    their demonstrations. The Revolutionary Union Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was established when several
    Marxist-Leninist groups who were against the Soviet Union and China,
    joined forces during the Union Conference in 1979. The official
    publication of this organization was a weekly called The Revolution . Only
    a few months later, the organization was divided into three factions over
    how to deal with the Islamic regime. After the suppression of opposition
    of the Islamic regime began in the summer of 1981, the activities of this
    organization were halted. Some members joined the Communist Combatants
    Union and ultimately the Communist Party of Iran. Some approached the
    National Resistance Council, and some other members got involved in
    cultural activities. Arrest and detention According to the information
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation, Mr. Ruzbeh Shakerifard was arrested on
    August 30, 1981 in Tehran. The details of his arrest and detention are not
    known. He was supposed to go to Mashhad with his brother-in-law but did
    not come to the meeting place. His family s efforts to obtain information
    of his condition and whereabouts, including inquiring with Evin Prison,
    bore no fruit. In early December, Mr. Ruzbeh Shakerifard contacted his
    family by telephone and informed them that he had been tried and was
    awaiting sentencing. Mr. Shakerifard was detained at Evin Prison and was
    not allowed visitations with his family. He only had two phone
    conversations with his family. The second time, on December 27, 1981, he
    was able to contact his sister-in-law s (brother s wife s) family and say
    his goodbyes. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    According to information sent to the Boroumand Foundation, his trial took
    place at Evin Prison and he was not very hopeful afterwards. Charges No
    information is available on the defendant s charges. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available about the defendant s defence. Judgment According to the
    information sent to Omid, Mr. Ruzbeh Shakerifard was executed on December
    27, 1981 at Evin Prison. A few days later, the authorities informed his
    family of his execution, turned his belongings over to them and told them
    that he had been buried in Section 92 of Behesht e Zahra Cemetery. When
    the family went to the gravesite, they witnessed the burial of corpses in
    bloody clothes in that same section. In 2011-12 when Ruzbeh s mother
    passed away and the family decided to bury her alongside her son, the
    grave was opened and Mr. Ruzbeh Shakerifard s brother realized that there
    was no sign of a bullet in his head. Since a coup de grace is usually
    administered after being shot by a firing squad, it is therefore not known
    whether he was hanged or shot. He left a will that he wrote while in
    prison, in which he bid farewell to his family.
