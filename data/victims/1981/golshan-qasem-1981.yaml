    News of the execution of Mr. Qasem Golshan, along with eight others, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on June 24, 1981. The Public
    Relations Department of the Central Public Prosecutor’s Office issued an
    announcement concerning these executions, the defendants' names, and their
    charges, and released it to the Pars news agency. Next day, the Central
    Public Prosecutor’s Office issued a corrective announcement regarding the
    charges against him. Additionally, news of the execution of Mr. Golshan,
    along with 66 others, was published in the Peykar publication, number 113,
    on July 6, 1981. Mr. Golshan is one of the 430 individuals whose names
    appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va
    Peykar. He is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to the corrective announcement of the Central Public
    Prosecutor’s Office, Mr. Golshan was arrested before June 20, 1981. The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges In the
    first announcement by the Central Public Prosecutor’s Office, the charges
    against Mr. Golshan were announced as "active membership in Peykar,
    assault and battery against people, participation in armed confrontations
    against the Islamic Republic, possession of acid, pepper, vinegar and
    killing tools, and apostate." In the corrective announcement issued on
    June 25, 1981, the charges against Mr. Qasem Golshan were changed to
    "active cooperation with the anti-revolutionary organization of Peykar,
    being in charge of a team, establishing and frequenting an organizational
    house, establishing a center for publication and distribution of
    bulletins, announcements, and other publications of the Peykar
    Organizational, writing articles and reports for the publication,
    promoting riot and disturbance across the society, and writing reports
    about various places, including garrisons, in order to injure the Islamic
    Republic. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Golshan's defense. Judgment
    َThe Central Islamic Revolutionary Court identified Mr. Golshan as "an
    enemy of God, an apostate, a corruptor on earth, and a rebel." He was
    condemned to death and the ruling was carried out in Evin prison on June
    22, 1981 at 9 pm.
