    News of the execution of Mr. Abdollah Sarrafiun, son of Mohammad, along
    with eighteen others, was published in the Keyhan and Jomhuri Eslami
    newspapers on August 16, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the
    Revolutionary and Public Prosecution Office of Tehran issued an
    announcement about this execution and released it to the Pars news agency.
    Mr. Abdollah Sarrafiun is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on
    the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the Organization who died after the
    Revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Mr. Sarrafiun is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The communiqu of the
    Revolutionary Prosecution Office, which calls the convicts sworn agents of
    the superpowers , begins with a reference to the Koran: It is but a just
    recompense for those who make war on God and His apostle and endeavor to
    spread corruption on earth, that they are being slain in great numbers, or
    crucified in great numbers, or have, in result of their perverseness,
    their hands and feet cut off in great numbers, or are being [entirely]
    banished from [the face of] the earth: such is their ignominy in this
    world . But in the life to come [yet more] awesome suffering awaits them
    [5:33]. According to the Peykar publication on September 29, 1981, Mr.
    Sarrafiun became a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization in September of
    1978. He established an active connection with the organization in 1979
    and worked in the Distribution and Services Section of the organization.
    Later he served the organization in the Public Relations and Financial
    Section of Peykar. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to the Peykar report, Mr. Sarrafiun was arrested in July of 1981
    when the organization was attacked by the regime. The details of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Sarrafiun are
    collective, vague, and include eighteen other defendants. In the
    announcement by the Revolutionary Prosecution Office there is no reference
    to a specific crime committed by any single defendant. The announcement
    charges Mr. Sarrafiun with being a high ranking member of the Public
    Relations and Financial Section of the organization and in charge of
    financial affairs of the American organization of Peykar working in a fake
    company named Iran. It also states some collective charges such as,
    attacking innocent people, assault and battery, murder, frequenting the
    organization's houses, activities for overthrowing the Islamic Republic
    regime, planning to assassinate officials, intending to carry out plans
    for world imperialism headed by the US. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court
    condemned Mr. Sarrafiun to death and the ruling was carried out in the
    Evin prison yard in Tehran on July 15, 1981.
