    The execution of Brigadier General Jalal Sojde’i, son of Mohammad Kazem,
    and 21 other individuals was announced by the Public Relations section of
    the Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office and published in the
    Jomhuri Eslami and the Kayhan newspapers on December 26, 1981. The reports
    state that he “was head of Savak in Zanjan, and for three years was the
    head of the so-call anti-sabotage joint committee of the overthrown
    Pahlavi regime”. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Brigadier
    General Sojde’i’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial There is no
    information regarding this trial, other than he was tried at the Central
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal. Charges Brigadier General Sojde’i and
    another individual were collectively charged with “participation in the
    shameful coup d’état of August 19 [1953], repression of honorable Muslim
    population of Qom in 1963, repression of students of Tehran University
    during the Revolution, following the orders of [Amir Abbas] Hoveyda,
    arresting a group of opponents of the Monarchy, martyring hundreds of
    youth through torture methods of the Middle Ages”. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available concerning Brigadier General
    Sojde’i’s defense. Judgment The Central Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    condemned Brigadier General Jalal Sojde’i to death. He was executed on
