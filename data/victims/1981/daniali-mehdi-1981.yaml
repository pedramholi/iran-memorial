    The news of the execution of Mr. Mehdi Daniali was announced by a Bandar
    Anzali Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office published in Kayhan on
    July 14, 1981 and in Jomhouri Eslami on July 15, 1981. Mr. Daniali, 19,
    student, and a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, is also one
    of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Daniali s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial According to the Bandar Anzali Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office communiqu , Mr. Daniali was tried before
    the Bandar Anzali Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal on July 6, 1981. No
    detailed information is available on Mr. Daniali s trial. Charges
    According to the communiqu from Bandar Anzali Islamic Revolutionary
    Prosecutor s Office Mr. Daniali and another defendant were charged with
    participating in and leading illegal demonstrations, conducting
    organizational activity in the Khomam and Some e Sara region, clashing
    with and injuring Muslim brothers with a knife, inducing fear and panic,
    corrupting young women and men of the region and guiding them towards
    counter-revolutionary activities, and destruction and breaking of doors
    and windows of shops. p Evidence of guilt The Bandar Anzali Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office communiqu cited the following as
    evidence against Mr. Daniali and another defendant: A report by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, field investigations and an inquiry
    from the devout people of the region, testimony of eye-witnesses, and
    confession of the defendants to acting on behalf of the Mojahedin
    Organization and being its leader in Khomam and surrounding areas.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. In the case of political detainees, these confessions are,
    at times, televised. The National Television broadcasts confessions during
    which prisoners plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and
    renounce their political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights
    organizations have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by
    those prisoners who are freed. Defense According to the Bandar Anzali
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office communiqu Mr. Daniali defended
    himself after his indictment was read in court. No detailed information is
    available on Mr. Daniali s defense.. Judgment The Bandar Anzali Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal found Mr. Daniali guilty of waging war against God
    and God s Prophet, corruption on earth, and rebelling against the Islamic
    Republic. Mr. Daniali was sentenced to death, and he was executed by a
    firing squad on July 12, 1981. Mr. Daniali was 19 years old at the time of
    his execution.. * *The exclusion of MKO members from government offices
    and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction
    with to the Islamic Republic authorities different interpretation of
    Islam, widened the gap between t
