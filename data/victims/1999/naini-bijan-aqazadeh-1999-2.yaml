    Bijan Aqazadeh Na ini, 43 years old, was an electronics engineer.
    Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Bijan Aqazadeh Na
    ini and five other individuals was published on the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization website (April 7, 2008, and March 2, 2011) and on Iran
    Efshagar (Iran Probe) website (June 9, 2019). According to available
    information, Mr. Bijan Aqazadeh Na ini, 43 years old, was an electronics
    engineer and a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Mr. Bijan Aqazadeh Na ini s Death
    According to available information, at 8 o clock in the morning of June 9,
    1999, Mr. Aqazadeh Na ini and 36 other people were on a bus going from
    Baghdad (Iraq) to the Ashraf Camp, when, after leaving Baghdad and while
    they were in the northeast of the city, a car that had been parked on the
    side of the road exploded, thus making them the targets of an
    assassination. As a result of the explosion, Mr. Aqazadeh Na ini and three
    other individuals named Fariba Mozarmi, Abbas Rafi vardanjani, and Akbar
    Qanbarnejad were killed instantly, and two others, Massumeh Gudarzi and
    Javad Fotuhi died a few hours later due to the extent of their injuries.
    21 people who were on the bus were injured in the incident, as were the
    riders of another bus transporting Iraqi citizens that was on the same
    road at the same time as the explosion. On June 10, 1999, as a funeral was
    being held at Ashraf Camp for the victims of the explosion, the camp
    became the target of a rocket attack, which did not result in any injuries
    or casualties to the Mojahedin since the rocket had hit a location outside
    and had injured a number of the residents of the village adjacent to the
    Ashraf Camp. Officials Reaction There is no information regarding the
    Iranian Officials reaction to Mr. Aqazadeh Na ini s killing. Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization s Reaction The Mojahedeen Khalq Organization held the
    Islamic Republic of Iran s Ministry of Information responsible for the
    explosion and considered the bombing one of 150 terrorist acts the regime
    governing Iran had carried out on Iraqi soil since 1991 against their
    Organization with the cooperation of Iraqi supporters of the Iranian
    regime . The Mojahedeen quoted an Iraqi publication that supported Iran
    called Al-Howzeh, that had stated this about the bombing: For example, a
    few years ago, one of the Iraqi heroes caused the explosion of a bus
    transporting about 50 of the elements of this terrorist organization in
    the Bub-Al-Sham district behind the Al-Shoab Seytareh. Since that day,
    cars are not allowed to park on this street, which began from the Baghdad
    crescent [road] and continued until Qalebieh. They also described the
    reason for the explosion: We are writing this to remind the government of
    Iraq [and question them as to] why the Mojahedin are running around
    without any obstacles or any control, and American occupying forces have
    taken on the task of protecting them? What is upsetting is that Iraq s
    measly budget must provide for the expenses of this terrorist
    organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization sent the information
    obtained from this publication to relevant international institutions.
    Family s Reaction There is no information regarding Mr. Aqazadeh Na ini s
    family s reaction. Impact on Family There is no information regarding the
