    The following information about Mr. Ezzatollah Ebrahimnejad s case has
    been gathered from the following sources: The websites of the newsletter
    of the students of Amir Kabir University (Interview with Ebrahimnejad s
    brother, 12 July 2008, and conversation with Ebrahimnejad s family lawyer,
    21 May 2005); ISNA (Iranian Student News Agency), 8 July 2002, 10 May and
    6 March 2003, 29 December, 30 January and 18 May 2005; Ruz,30 December
    2005; Ezzatollah Ebrahimnejad s weblog, 1 January and 11 February 2006;
    Cheshmandaz Iran , (Special issue) 9 July 2005; BBC News, 14 and 28
    October 2006; Iran , 24 July 2001; and the Report of the United Nations
    Human Rights Commission of the United Nations for 2005. Ezzatollah
    Ebrahimnejad, age 24, had graduated from the School of Law of the
    University of Ahvaz in 1998. In early summer of the same year, he was
    completing his term of military service in Tehran. He was known for his
    for love of literature, especially poetry. According to his close friends,
    he had cooperated with a number of literary journals in the city of Ahvaz
    and used to attend local literary group meetings. He had also befriended a
    number of university students in Ahvaz, Dezful and Poledokhtar. In Tehran
    too, he was in contact with university student circles and used to visit
    the dormitories of the University of Tehran during the weekends. One of
    his friends said that Ebrahimnejad had an energetic character and was an
    active and frequent participant in public marches and demonstrations, at
    times in the forefront of the lines. The report submitted to the court by
    the Ministry of Information also refers to Ebrahimnejad s close contact
    with religious-nationalist circles and the Islamic associations of
    University students and his active participation in their public
    gatherings and demonstrations. On July 9, 1999, he had gone, as was his
    habit during holidays, to visit with his friends at the University campus.
    The July 9, 1999 Incident In the early morning hours of July 9, the day
    after students demonstrations to denounce the closing of the daily
    newspaper Salam , members of the Riot Guards, along with members of
    government supported militia in civilian clothes, known as Hezbollah s
    Aides, raided the dormitories of the University of Tehran and began
    battering and seriously injuring many students, some of whom had been
    barely awake. The invaders then proceeded to savagely ransack the rooms
    and destroy or pilfer the students belongings. The raid was apparently a
    reaction to the gathering of students to protest the closing of the
    reformist daily journal, Salam . The protests had flared up following the
    publication of a letter by Said Emami (one of the undersecretaries of the
    Ministry of Information who had been accused of complicity in the serial
    murder of the opponents and critics of the regime). The letter disclosed a
    government plan to tighten control over newspapers. An announcement posted
    on campus bulletin boards, called on students to congregate in protest to
    the restrictions imposed on, and the closing of, dissident journals.
    Answering the call, several hundred students gathered in front of the
    campus gate and began to shout slogans in praise of freedom and
    condemnation of tyranny. The students continued their march from the
    campus area to an adjacent street and finally returned to their
    dormitories. Some of the students, however, noticing the presence of
    security forces and plain-clothes militia, remained in the street and
    following a brief skirmish with the militia returned to their dormitories
    at the request of the president of the university. Later on, following the
    raid of the dormitories by the riot police and plain-clothes militia, a
    number of students, along with the University president were arrested and
    taken away. Denouncing the violent and destructive police raid on their
    dormitories, a few thousand of shocked and angry students continued their
    demonstrations for another day. According to a BBC report, nearly 20,000
    students had participated in one of the street demonstrations. Protestors
    in Tabriz University were also brutally attacked. Furthermore, according
    to the report of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations for the
    year 2000, nearly 1500 individuals were arrested over the course of these
    demonstrations in Tehran, and, on the basis of the available evidence, at
    least 8 persons were killed in the demonstrations and the campus raid. The
    authorities, however, confirmed the death of only one of the demonstrators
    by gunfire: Ezzatollah Ebrahimnejad. The Trial of the Accused in the
    Campus Raid On March 4th 1999, pursuant to the complaint lodged by the
    injured students, began the trial of the personnel of the security forces
    who had been accused and indicted for the injuries suffered by a number of
    students in the campus incident. The trial was conducted in the 7th branch
    of the military court of the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
    The court dismissed the cases against Far
