    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad R., along with seven others, was
    published on the websites of Kerman Courthouse on August 17 and October 6,
    and ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on October 6, 2010, quoting the
    Public Relations Office of the Kerman Courthouse. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. This trial
    took place at the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Kerman. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Mohammad R. was announced as "participation in
    smuggling narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence presented against the defendant was announced as
    "transportation of 2,317 kilograms of opium." Defence No information is
    available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Mohammad R. to death and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public
    Prosecutor. The Provincial Pardon Commission rejected the defendant s
    requests for pardon and he was hanged in the Kerman Central prison yard.
    The exact date of this execution is unknown.
