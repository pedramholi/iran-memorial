    News of the execution of Mr. Mehdi Esma ili was published on the website
    of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on March 7, 2010. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and
    detention. According to the report, Mr. Mehdi Esma ili had been imprisoned
    in Andarzgah Five at Raja ishahr prison in Karaj for seven years, since he
    was 19 years old. Trial No information is available on the defendant s
    trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Mehdi Esma ili was announced as
    "murder." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defence No information is available on the defendant's defence.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mehdi Esma ili to death and he was hanged
    at Raja ishahr prison in Karaj in late February of 2010. Mr. Mehdi Esma
    ili was 26 years old.
