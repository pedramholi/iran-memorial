    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with seven others,
    was published on the websites of Fars news agency and IRNA (Islamic
    Republic News Agency) on January 1, 2011, quoting the Public and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor of Qom. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. According to the
    Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Qom, these defendants were arrested
    in 2010. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. This
    trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qom. Charges The
    charge against the defendant was announced as "dealing narcotics." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against the defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant’s defence. Judgment The court condemned the defendant to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor. He
    requested pardon, twice, and it was twice rejected. The defendant was
    hanged at the Central Prison in Qom a week before the report was
    published.
