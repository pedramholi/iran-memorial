    News of Mr. Abdolmajid (Abdolmalek) Rigi s execution was published by
    Tehran General and Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office News Outlet
    (June 20, 2010), ISNA (June 20, 2010), and other media. Additional
    information was obtained from the IRNA website (June 22, 2010), ISNA (June
    20, 2010, and February 23, 2010), and other news sources.* Mr. Abdolmajid
    Rigi was probably born in 1979-80 in the city of Zahedan in Iran s Sistan
    and Baluchestan Province. He was born into a very large and relatively
    poor family of the Rigi tribe (one of the Baluch tribes). Mr. Rigi had six
    brothers, one of whom was killed in an armed skirmish in the Saravan
    region. His youngest brother was killed in a suicide mission at the
    Saravan Police Force garrison, and his older brother was executed in
    Zahedan in 2010. Mr. Rigi s case concerns his leadership of the Jondollah
    Group and the carrying out of a number of lethal operations during which a
    number of civilians as well as members of the Police Force were killed.
    Based on available information, Rigi was castigated at school for
    disorderly conduct and repeatedly getting into fights with his classmates
    in 1995-96 (when he was in seventh grade) and quit school to start work as
    a street vendor. His parents took him back to school when they discovered
    this, but the principal refused to let him back because he had been absent
    for two months. He worked as a street vendor in Zahedan for six months but
    stopped after several run-ins with the police. After giving up peddling,
    Mr. Rigi went to rural areas as a part of Jama at Tabligh [1] groups for a
    short while, in order to promote the Sunni Islam faith. He showed interest
    in becoming an Emir ( head ) of the Jama at Tabligh, which was a religious
    position and title, but he was ignored due to his lack of religious
    knowledge and so became disillusioned. Mr. Rigi then turned to religious
    studies. He studied at a Sunni seminary in Zahedan for two months and
    subsequently went to Saravan s Gasht Seminary. Based on available
    information, he was expelled for being disorderly and raising subject
    matters outside the scope of the seminary s customs , and stayed home for
    three months. He then went to Makki Seminary in Zahedan, from which he was
    also expelled for similar reasons. His consecutive expulsions adversely
    affected Mr. Rigi and his family s morale. Based on published information,
    Mr. Rigi unofficially exited the country in 1997-98 and joined the
    Mohammad Rassul Allah Army [2] headed by Mollabakhsh Derakhshan, and three
    months later joined the Al-Forghan Group [3] headed by Molavi Abdoljalil
    Qanbarzehi for three weeks. Crossing the border without undergoing the
    legal formalities was customary in the region and was not considered to be
    a significant illegal occurrence. Following successive blows by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran s armed forces and police force, the Mohammad
    Rassul Allah Army engaged in political and armed combat with the latter
    through transporting unofficial cargoes that were said to contain drugs.
    The Al-Forghan group had also declared its activity to consist of
    religious combat with the Islamic Republic . Based on available
    information, Mr. Rigi and several of his friends went to the Faruqiah
    (Binuria) Madrasah [or seminary] in Karachi, Pakistan, which held Salafi
    views, to continue his religious education, and studied there for two
    years. Based on available information, during that period, he and his
    friends reached the conclusion that Shi a Moslems were Kafer ( infidels ).
    Mr. Rigi was able to establish contact with Al-Qaeda and Taliban forces,
    who frequented the madrasah, given their comings and goings there. He
    returned to Zahedan at the end of this two-year period, got married, and
    went to various provinces under the auspices of Jama at Tabligh for six
    months. In the spring of 2001, he and several of his friends went to
    Bagram, Afghanistan, with an eye to joining Al Qaeda. He underwent a
    two-month training in guerilla warfare and use of heavy and semi-heavy
    weaponry, and officially became a member of Al Qaeda. He subsequently went
    to Quetta, Pakistan, under the auspices of Al Qaeda to continue his
    religious education, and while doing so, went back and forth for a
    three-month period between Al Qaeda s base in Afghanistan and Quetta s
    religious madrasahs. After the events of September 11, 2001, he gathered
    members of his family in Zahedan, as well as other individuals who held
    the same beliefs as he did, and left for Qonduz, Afghanistan, leading a
    37-member group, in order to assist the Taliban in fighting American
    forces. After a two-month war, he was captured by the Northern Alliance
    forces following the Taliban s defeat. His Iranian nationality was
    discovered and recognized in the winter of 2002, and upon expressing
    regret and pledging not to support the Taliban and Al Qaeda, he was
    released in the spring of 2002 and returned to Iran. Based on available
    information, Mr. Rigi was stricken with mental and psychological illn
