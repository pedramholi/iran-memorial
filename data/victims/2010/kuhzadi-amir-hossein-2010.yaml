    The news about Mr. Amir Hossein Kuhzadi s murder, while at the police
    detention center in Sari, was sent to the Boroumand Foundation via an
    electronic form by a person familiar with this case. According to this
    information, Mr. Kuhzadi, son of Ali, was born in Tehran in 1986. He was
    single, a high school graduate, and a conscripted soldier serving in the
    Islamic Revolutionary Guards.* Arrest and detention According to the
    information in the electronic form, Mr. Kuhzadi was arrested in Sari on
    May 25, 2010 at 10 a.m. The arresting agents had no warrant and arrested
    him for wearing a green T-shirt and having a verbal argument. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges No information
    is available on the defendant s charges. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt There
    is no information on the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available about the defendant s defense. Judgment
    According to the above-mentioned source, Mr. Kuhzadi was murdered the day
    after his arrest, May 26, 2010, while being held at the police detention
    center in Sari. The authorities and the coroner announced his cause of
    death as unknown. Despite the inquiry of Mr. Kuhzadi s family, his cause
    of death is still unclear. The prison officials have been reluctant to
    look into this matter. For example, although the detention center was
    under surveillance of closed circuit cameras, according to the case
    inspector, the cameras did not record anything that day because a number
    of forks and spoons fell on the camera cables.
