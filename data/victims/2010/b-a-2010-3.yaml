    News of the execution of Mr. A. B., along with two others, was published
    on the website of Khabare-Jonub on October 10, 2010. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial
    took place at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Bovanat. Charges The
    charge against Mr. A. B. was announced as "participation in the armed
    transportation of 65 kilograms and 600 grams of opium." The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defence No information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. A. B. to death and the ruling was confirmed by the
    General Public Prosecutor’s Office. He was hanged at the Adelabad prison
    in Shiraz. The exact date of this execution is unknown.
