    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad. A. was published in the Vatan-e
    Emruz newspaper on September 21, 2010 and on the website of Modafe,
    Mohammad Mostafavi weblog, on September 25, 2010. Additional information
    was taken from the Khabaronline on July 24, 2008, the Iran newspaper on
    April 11, 14, 15, and 28, 2007, September 16, 2007, and January 29, 2008,
    on the websites of Entekhab on September 16, 2007, Farsnama on April 12,
    14, and 25, 2007, May 13, and June 11, 2007, Khabaronline, Farsnama, and
    Aftab news agency on April 28, 2007, Hamshahrionline and Jamejam on April
    27, 2007, and the Qods newspaper on April 17, 2007. Mr. Mohammad. A s case
    and four others are related to the murder of a ten-year-old Afghan boy and
    a nine-year-old boy from Marvdasht in that city on April 1 and 4, 2007. He
    was not legally and adult at the time of committing the crime.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention
    on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and
    detention According to the police commander of the Fars province, Mr.
    Mohammad A. was arrested, along with three others, by the Intelligence
    Police in Marvdasht on April 6, 2007, during the police investigation
    regarding the disappearance of a boy from Marvdasht and an Afghan boy
    whose parents filed complaints (Iran newspaper). However, the
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch Two
    of the Criminal Court of Fars in Shiraz tried Mr. Mohammad A. and three
    other adolescent defendants. One of the defendants was sent to the
    Children s Court due to his young age. The first court session took place
    on April 26, 2007. With the Consultation of the judges and advisors and
    based on Article 225 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for Children, the
    court session was closed to the public and everyone left the court except
    the victim s families (Farsnama). The trial, headed by a judge and four
    advisors, lasted in seven sessions and a total time of 56 hours. (Iran
    newspaper) Charges According to the judges of Branch Two of the Criminal
    Court of Fars, the charges brought against Mr. Mohammad A., the second row
    defendant, were announced as murder of a nine-year-old boy from Marvdasht,
    in collaboration with the first row defendant, and harassment, in
    collaboration with two other defendants, and kidnapping, in collaboration
    with all four defendants (Iran newspaper). After raping two victims,
    defendants tied their hands and feet and threw them in the Kor River near
    Marvdasht. The victim s bodies were found by police near the river.
    However, the rape charge against the defendants was rejected by the court
    due to their denial and the report by forensics indicating that defendants
    were not adults. (Iran newspaper) The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Mohammad A. was his confession, the
    recovery of two boys bodies in the river, the forensics report, and
    testimonies of eight witnesses. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Mohammad A. was under 18
    years old when the crime was committed. According to the judge, he and the
    other three defendants defended themselves during the third court session.
    Additionally, the objections by attorneys related to the defendants
    immaturity were discussed. However, no further information is available on
    his defense. Judgment Branch Two of the Criminal Court of Fars condemned
    Mr. Mohammad A. to death for murder and to 8 years imprisonment and 100
    lashes for harassment. Branch 33 of the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged in the Marvdasht Prison on July 10, 2010. The first
    row defendant was condemned to death for murdering the ten-year-old Afghan
    boy and 18 years imprisonment and 100 lashes for assistance in murder of
    the nine-year-old boy and harass
