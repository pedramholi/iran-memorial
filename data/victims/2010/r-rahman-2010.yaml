circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Rahman R. was published on the website of
    Khuzestan Courthouse on April 26, 2010, quoting the Public Relations
    Office of the Dezful Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place at the Dezful
    Penal Court. Charges The charge against Mr. Rahman R. was announced as
    "assault and battery resulting in murder." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence presented against the defendant was his “confession.”
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    torture to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defence No information
    is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Rahman R. to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He
    was hanged at the Dezful prison on April 20, 2010.
