    News of the execution of Mr. M. Kh., son of Ebrahim, along with two
    others, was published on the websites of Fars news agency and Lorna News
    Base on August 12, 2010, quoting the Head of Azna Courthouse. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and
    detention. According to the media reports, the defendants were arrested in
    2009. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    The charge against Mr. M. Kh. and two other defendants was announced as
    "kidnapping." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defence No information is available on the defendant's defence.
    Judgment No specific information is available about the defendant’s
    execution. Mr. M. Kh. was hanged in public at Namaz Square in Azna on
    August 11, 2010.
