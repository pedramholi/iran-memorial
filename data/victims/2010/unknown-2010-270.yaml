    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with four others,
    was published on the websites of ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) and
    the Islamic Republic Security Force Information Base on November 9, 2010,
    quoting the Security Force Information Base. Arrest and Detention There is
    no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. According
    to this report, the Combat Narcotics Police in Minudasht, Golestan,
    identified and arrested the defendant. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place in the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Gondad-e Kavus. Charges The charges against the
    defendant were announced as "intention to transport narcotics, heroin, to
    the Golestan province." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against the defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available on the defendant’s defence. Judgment The court condemned the
    defendant to death and he was hanged in Gondad-e Kavus on November 9,
    2010.
