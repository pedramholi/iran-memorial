date_of_death: 2010-01-01

place_of_death: "Taybad"
province: "Khorasan-e Razavi"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Hanging"
circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with two others, was
    published on the websites of the Qods newspaper on April 11, and the
    Khorasan-Razavi Courthouse on April 13, 2010, quoting the Public and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor of Tayebad. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place
    in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tayebad. Charges The charge against
    the defendant was announced as "armed importing of narcotics into the
    country." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant’s defence. Judgment The court condemned the defendant to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor. He
    was hanged in Tayebad. The exact date of the execution is unknown.
