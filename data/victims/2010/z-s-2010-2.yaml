    News of the execution of Ms. S. Z. was published on the website of the
    Qods newspaper on June 6, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Prison Office in Quchan. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. According to this
    report, the defendant was arrested while on leave from Quchan prison. She
    had been imprisoned for transportation and selling of narcotics. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place
    in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Quchan. Charges The charges against
    Ms. S. Z. were announced as "transportation and possession of 680 grams of
    methamphetamine and 430 grams of opium." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defence No information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment
    The court condemned Ms. S. Z. to death and she was hanged at the Quchan
    prison yard. The exact date of this execution is unknown.
