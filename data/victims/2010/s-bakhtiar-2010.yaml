    News of the execution of Mr. Bakhtiar S., along with three others, was
    published on the websites of Esfahan Courthouse on December 5, and ISNA
    (Iranian Students News Agency) on December 4, 2010, quoting the Public
    Relations Office of the Esfahan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is
    no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place
    at Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Esfahan. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Bakhtiar S. were announced as "having a previous
    record for narcotics, possession of 74 kilograms and 800 grams of crack
    [cocaine], transportation and possession of 56 kilograms and 100 grams of
    crack [cocaine], possession of 603 grams opium, 94 grams of burned opium
    and two opium pipes, and addiction." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Bakhtiar S. to death, two years imprisonment, 18.2 million
    Rials fine, and 70 lashes. The ruling was confirmed by the General Public
    Prosecutor. After the defendant’ requests for pardon were denied, twice,
    he was hanged in the Esfahan Central prison yard on December 4, 2010. Mr.
    Bakhtiar S. was 44 years old.
