    He was a specialist who had examined the Kahrizak and Evin prisoners that

    their cases. News of Dr. Abdolreza Sudbakhsh s death was published by Fars
    News Agency and Farhikhtegan newspaper on September 22, 2010. Additional
    information about this case was obtained through the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center s interview with his son, Mr. Damoon Sudbakhsh, and the Center s
    research (October 7, 2017), the indictment against the defendants in the
    Kahrizak case (December 16, 2009), Human Rights Activists report entitled
    Behind the Scenes of the Plan Known as Increasing Social Safety Kahrizak ,
    (September 1, 2007), and reports published on the Rooz Online website
    (August 24 and 28, 2011), in The Guardian (August 25, 2011), Vatan-e
    Emrooz newspaper (October 26, 2010), the Government s News Website
    (September 22, 2010), Jaras website (September 27, 2010), and ILNA News
    Agency (October 5, 2010). Dr. Abdolreza Sudbakhsh, child of Mohammad Reza,
    born in Bandar Anzali, was 61 years old, married, and had four children
    (three sons and a daughter). He spent his childhood and school years in
    Bandar Anzali. He obtained his high school diploma in 1967 and was
    accepted that same year at [the city of] Mashhad s Ferdosi University in
    the medical program. In order to fulfill the requirement of [Service in
    Deprived Regions] Plan, he went to the city of Kermanshah and got married
    there. He took up residence in Kermanshah and lived there during the
    Iran-Iraq war. While studying for his specialization in infectious
    diseases, Dr. Sudbakhsh was a professor at Amir al-Mo menin Hospital in
    [Tehran s] Javadieh neighborhood. In addition to his other duties,* he was
    the head of the infectious diseases department and an infectious diseases
    specialist at Tehran s Imam Khomeini Hospital, [appeared as] an expert
    [witness in court] in [cases involving] the Medical Examiner s Office, and
    was an expert for the country s Physicians Order; that was why he had
    examined the victims of the events at the Kahrizak [Detention Center]. He
    also had a private office. According to his son, Dr. Sudbakhsh was a
    hard-working physician who loved his job. He usually worked from 7 o clock
    in the morning until 11 o clock at night. He tried to help others as much
    as he possibly could, including people he did not know. He always
    persevered and tried to do his job as best he could, and would always take
    the path he considered to be the right one. (Boroumand Center interview).
    According to one of his students, Dr. Sudbakhsh was a down to earth, kind,
    and honest man. He spoke simply and clearly, and had warm relations with
    his students and was always glad to lend a helping hand in solving their
    academic problems. (Fars News Agency, September 22, 2010). Dr. Sudbakhsh
    never talked about work at home and always separated his personal life
    from his professional life; nevertheless, he was always very worried about
    his patients. For instance, if he had a very sick patient, or realized
    that a patient s treatment had not been done properly and had not
    benefited him/her, he would be upset and would make every effort to help
    and correct the situation. Dr. Sudbakhsh usually did not talk about his
    professional issues at home; however, in the days leading up to the event,
    he had talked to his family about certain unusual cases. (Boroumand Center
    interview). Dr. Sudbakhsh s case is related to the Kahrizak incident.
    Based on available information, Dr. Sudbakhsh had knowledge of the medical
    files of all those who had died at the Kahrizak Detention center. He was a
    specialist who had examined the Kahrizak and Evin prisoners that had been
    subjected to sexual assault, and had specific information about their
    cases. (Jaras, October 27, 2010). Kahrizak Detention center Kahrizak
    Detention Center or Kahrizak Camp was a place built in the year 2000
    following the purge of Khak Sefid neighborhood in eastern Tehran of drug
    dealers and addicts, and used to hold those arrestees. Prior to 2009, this
    Camp was used to hold and intimidate people arrested in Social Safety
    Plans who were labelled hoodlums and miscreants , and not much information
    was available about their treatment there. Following the 2009 protests**
    and the death of three protestors at Kahrizak Detention Center (including
    the son of a high-ranking government official s adviser), Tehran Province
    Judiciary s Council on the Supervision and Inspection of Citizens Rights
    issued a report addressing the deaths. Subsequently, in accordance with a
    decree issued by the Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran and upon the
    Head of the Judiciary First Deputy s order, the Kahrizak Detention Center
    was shut down and a case was opened in Tehran Military Prosecutor s Office
    concerning crimes committed by Kahrizak Detention Center officials and
    guards, and sent to the Investigating Judge s Office, Branch One.
