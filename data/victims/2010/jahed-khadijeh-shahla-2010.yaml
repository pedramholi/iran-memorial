    Introduction Information regarding Ms. Khadijeh (Shahla) Jahed s execution
    was collected from Amnesty International s website (1, 25 November 2005,
    11 March 2008, 23, 30 November and 1 December 2010), European Parliament
    (6 December 2010), The Islamic Human Rights Commission (4 August 2008),
    Guardian (30 November 2010), Dwiche Welle (1 December 2010), BBC (12
    February 2009), Abdolsamad Khorramshahi s Personal Website (quoting
    Eghtesad va Zendegi Magazine, 12 March 2011, quoting Ettefaghe No, July
    2010, quoting Nasim Haraz Magazine, March 2008, quoting Ettefaq No, July
    2010)(1) and a documentary named, Red Card. Ms. Jahed was 41 year old and
    temporary wife of Naser Mohammadkhani, the Iranian famous soccer player in
    the 80s. She had a high school diploma and an associate s degree in
    nursing. She was studying psychology long-distance in prison, and if she
    had not been executed, she could have obtained her bachelor s degree after
    one semester (an interview with Ms. Jahed s sister, Farhikhtegan, 1
    December 2010). According to Ms. Jahed, she was in love with Naser
    Mohammadkhani since she was 13. She met him at the same age once, but her
    relationship with him had begun 4 years before her arrest. She was
    temporarily married to him. According to Iranian law, a man and woman can
    be temporarily married for a certain amount of time with certain amount of
    cabinet. Ms. Jahed was working as a nurse and used to meet with Naser
    Mohammadkhani in an apartment which he bought for her (ISNA, 1 December
    2010). Ms. Jahed spent 9 years in detention waiting for her death.
    According to Ms. Fereshteh Ghazi, her cellmate, she was a nice, energetic
    woman who used to help new-comers in the prison (Guardian, 30 November
    2010). She was an active, sociable woman who had different
    responsibilities in prison; for example, she worked in the prison s
    supermarket (Abdolasamad Khorramshahi s Personal Website quoting Nasim
    Haraz Magazine, March 2007). Ms. Jahed s case was one of the most
    controversial and complicated murder cases in Iran. A documentary, Red
    Card, was made about this case which was banned in Iran (Guardian, 29
    November 2010). A great number of human rights activists, artists, etc at
    the national and international level tried to stop the execution. This
    execution also caused a severe international response in that many foreign
    media outlets covered the case as well as many human rights and political
    institutions that protested the Iranian government. For instance, the
    European Parliament condemned this execution as an example of torture and
    other inhumane and cruel acts (European Parliament, 6 December 2010).
    Arrest and Detention Ms. Jahed was arrested on 19 October 2002 for the
    murder of Ms. Saharkhizan, two weeks after the incident. She was arrested
    by the 10th Circuit of police force of Tehran. The detectives found out
    that on the day of Ms. Saharkhizan s murder, a woman cashed a blank check
    of Mr. Mohammad Khani in a bank. This clue led the detectives to Mr.
    Mohammadkhani s affair with Ms. Jahed and thus made her a primary suspect
    (Fars News, 24 September 2006; Roozonline, 30 November 2010; Etemad, 7
    July 2007; Entekhab, 25 September 2010). Trial The first judge of Ms.
    Jahed s case was off the case for unknown reasons. In January 2003,
    another judge was assigned to the case as a temporary substitute for the
    first judge who traveled to Saudi Arabia for Haj, but he completely took
    charge of the case afterwards (Roozonline, 30 November 2010). The first
    session of Ms. Jahed s trial was held on 6 June 2004 in Branch 1154 of
    Tehran Criminal Judicial Complex. This trial lasted four sessions, from
    which, 3 sessions were public and one session was not (ISNA, 1 December
    2010, Amnesty International, 23, 30 November and 1 December 2010).
    Afterwards, Ms. Jahed s case became very complicated and vicissitudinous.
    According to Article 223 of the Criminal Procedure, it was referred to
    Branch 15 of the Supreme Court and afterwards was sent for the
    Authorization of Ayatollah Shahrudi, the Head of the Judiciary (2). But in
    the fall of 2005, Ayatollah Shahrudi refused to authorize the execution
    and according to Article 18 of the Criminal Procedure, he declared the
    case clearly against Islamic Shari ah and sent it to another court (3).
    Ms. Jahed s case was resent to Branch 3 and 7 of the Supreme Court using
    this mechanism. At last, the case was sent to Branch 1147th of Be sat
    Judicial Complex (Amnesty International, 1 and 25 November 2005, 11 March
    2008, 23, 30 November and 1 December 2010). On 22 and 23 February 2009,
    another trial was held for Ms. Jahed. The court was closed. According to
    Mr. Khorramshahi, Ms. Jahed s lawyer, the trial was held not publicly with
    the judge s discretion. The defendant and her lawyer made several efforts
    to have a public trial but failed (Asr-e Iran, Ebrat, 16 March 2009). (4)
    Charges Ms. Jahed s charges were Ms. Saharkhizan s murder, theft of her
    properties, having an illegitimate affair with Naser Mohammadkhani, an
