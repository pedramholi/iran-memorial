    News of the execution of Mr. Behruz Sh., along three others, was published
    on the websites of Esfahan Courthouse on July 5, Iscanews on July 6, and
    Fars news agency on July 7, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of
    the Esfahan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. This trial took place in Branch
    Five of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Esfahan. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Behruz Sh. were announced as "transportation of crack and
    opium." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against the defendant was announced as possession of 18 grams of crack and
    30 grams of opium. Defence No information is available on the defendant's
    defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Behruz Sh. to death and the
    ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor. After the defendant
    s requests for pardon were denied twice, he was hanged in the Esfahan
    Central prison yard on July 5, 2010. Mr. Behruz Sh. was 24 years old.
