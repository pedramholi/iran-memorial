    News of the execution of an unknown person was published on the website of
    the Khorasan newspaper on March 7, 2010, quoting the Public Prosecutor of
    Sarakhs. Arrest and Detention According to the Public Prosecutor of
    Sarakhs, the defendant had been condemned to life imprisonment for
    smuggling narcotics and was detained in the Torbate-Jam prison. He was
    transferred to the Open Ward and went on a leave. He was arrested again
    for transporting heroin while on leave. The date of his second arrest is
    unknown. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The charge against the defendant was announced as “transportation
    of 4 kilograms and 800 grams of heroin.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defence No information is available on the defendant’s defence. Judgment
    The court condemned the defendant to death and his request for pardon was
    rejected by the Pardon Commission. He was hanged at Sarakhs. The date of
    execution is unknown. This defendant was 42 years old.
