    News of the execution of an unknown person was published on the websites
    of Ardebil Courthouse on April 27, and Fars news agency on April 28, 2010,
    quoting the Public Relations Office of the Ardebil Provincial Courthouse.
    Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s
    arrest and detention. According to the report, the defendant had been
    arrested by officials. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The charges against the defendant were
    announced as “smuggling and possession of heroin.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against the defendant was
    “possession of one kilogram and 23 grams of heroin.” Defence No
    information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the defendant’s execution. The court
    condemned the defendant to death and he was hanged at the Central Prison
    yard in Ardebil. The exact date of this execution is unknown.
