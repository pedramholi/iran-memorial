    News of the execution of Mr. Amanollah Purian, son of Malang, along with
    another person, was published on the websites of Sistan and Baluchestan
    Courthouse and Fars news agency on July 4, 2010, quoting the Public
    Relations Office of Sistan and Baluchestan Courthouse. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    This trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Zahedan.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Amanollah Purian were announced as "being
    Mohareb (fighter) and Mofsed (corruptor on Earth) by blocking roads, armed
    robbery, and creating intimidation and fear among public in Iranshahr,
    shooting at officials, participation in armed kidnapping, stealing a
    Peugeot 206 car, selling 60 kilograms of opium, addiction to opium, and
    illegally crossing the border." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Amanollah Purian
    to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Judiciary. He was
    hanged at the Zahedan central prison yard on July 4, 2010.
