circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown person from a village in Ardebil was
    published on the website of Ardebil Provincial Courthouse on January 21,
    2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Public and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor’s Office in Ardebil. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to the report,
    the defendant had murdered his brother-in-law during a fight over a land
    irrigation dispute in a village near Nayer in 2007. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available on the defendant's defence. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the defendant’s execution. The court condemned the
    defendant to death (Qesas) and he was hanged at the Central Prison yard in
    Ardebil. The exact date of this execution is unknown.
