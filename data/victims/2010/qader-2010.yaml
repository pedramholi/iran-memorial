    News of the execution of Mr. Qader, along with two others, was published
    on the websites of IMNA (Isfahan Metropolis News Agency) on April 11, and
    Fars news agency on April 12, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of
    the Esfahan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place at Branch
    Four of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Esfahan. Charges The charge
    against Mr. Qader was announced as "smuggling narcotics." The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against the defendant was
    announced as “transportation and possession of one kilogram and 30 grams
    and 50 centigrams of crack [cocaine].” Defence No information is available
    on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Qader to
    death and confiscation of his belongings. The ruling was confirmed by the
    General Public Prosecutor. The defendant’s request for pardon was rejected
    by the Provincial Pardon Commission, twice, and he was hanged in the yard
    of Esfahan Central Prison on April 11, 2010. Mr. Qader was 32 years old.
