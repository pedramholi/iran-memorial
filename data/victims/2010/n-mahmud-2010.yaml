    News of the execution of Mr. Mahmud N. was published on the website of the
    Nesfejahan newspaper on November 23, 2010, quoting the Head of Police
    Information Base in Esfahan. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. According to this
    report, he was arrested by the Narcotics Combat Police in Kashan. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place
    in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kashan. Charges The charges against
    Mr. Mahmud N. were announced as "transportation and possession of 500
    grams of crack." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mahmud N. to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was hanged at
    the Central Prison yard in Kashan. The exact date of this execution is
    unknown. Mr. Mahmud N. was 24 years old.
