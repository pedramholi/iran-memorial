circumstances: >
    News of the conviction and execution of Mr. Gholam H., along with four
    others, was published on the website of Kerman Courthouse on January 23
    and April 17, 2010. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information
    on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant s trial. This trial took place at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court in Kerman. Charges The charges against Mr. Gholam H.
    were announced as "participation in transportation and possession of opium
    and morphine." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against the defendant and two others was collectively announced as
    "possession of 595 kilograms of opium and 106 kilograms of morphine."
    Defence No information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Gholam H. to death and he was hanged in the Kerman
    prison on April 17, 2010.
