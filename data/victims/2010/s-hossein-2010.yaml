    News of the conviction and execution of Mr. Hossein S., along with four
    others, was published on the website of Kerman Courthouse on January 23
    and April 17, 2010. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information
    on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court in Kerman. Charges The charges against Mr. Hossein S.
    were announced as "rape." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hossein S. to
    death and he was hanged in the Kerman prison on April 17, 2010.
