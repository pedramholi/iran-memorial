circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with another person,
    was published on the websites of the Khorasan-Shomali Courthouse and
    Iscanews on May 31, 2010, quoting the Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of
    Shirvan. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. According to this report, the defendant
    was arrested in Khorasan-Shomali. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. This trial took place at the Revolutionary Court of
    Shirvan. Charges The charges against the defendant were announced as
    “transportation and possession of 949 grams of methamphetamine, and
    addiction.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant’s defence. Judgment The court condemned this defendant to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor. The
    defendant’s request for pardon was rejected by the Pardon Commission of
    the Judiciary. He was hanged in Shirvan on May 30, 2010.
