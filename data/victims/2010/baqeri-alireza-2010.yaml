    News of the execution of Mr. Alireza Baqeri, along with two others, was
    published on the website of Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran
    on September 23, 2010. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. According to the
    report, he had been awaiting execution in Section Three of the Central
    Prison in Esfahan for several years. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Alireza Baqeri was
    announced as "possession of narcotics." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defence No information is available on the defendant’s defence. Judgment
    No specific information is available about the defendant's execution. Mr.
    Alireza Baqeri was hanged at the Central Prison (Dastgerd) in Esfahan on
    September 21, 2010. Mr. Alireza Baqeri was 30 years old.
