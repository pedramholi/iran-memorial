    News of the execution of Mr. S. M. was published on the websites of
    Khuzestan Courthouse on March 9, and IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency)
    on March 11, 2010. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information
    on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. S. M. was
    announced as "smuggling narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the defendant’s execution. Mr. S. M. was
    hanged in public at Kuye-Ramezan in Ahvaz on March 10, 2010.
