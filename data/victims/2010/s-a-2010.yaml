    News of the execution of Mr. A. S., along with three others, was published
    on the websites of Zanjan Provincial Courthouse and Fars news agency on
    October 10, 2010. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on
    the defendant’s arrest and detention. According to the Fars news agency
    report, the defendant was arrested within Zanjan jurisdiction. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge
    against the defendant was announced as "smuggling narcotics." The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against the defendant was reported as, “possession of 20 kilograms and 250
    grams of heroin, one kilogram and 315 grams of ecstasy pills, and 38
    kilograms and 650 grams of opium.” Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment No specific information is available
    about the defendant’s execution. Mr. A. S. was hanged at Zanjan central
    prison in Eslamabad on October 10, 2010.
