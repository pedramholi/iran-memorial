    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Azarfam, along with twelve others,
    was published on the websites of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News
    Agency) on June 6, Modafe (Mohammad Mostafa’i website) on June 6 and 7,
    and Radio Baluch FM on June 8 and 15, 2010. According to Radio Baluch, six
    of these defendants were Baluches. News of the transfer of 26 narcotics
    prisoners to the Quarantine Ward before execution was published by HRANA
    and Modafe websites on June 6, 2010. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge
    against the defendant was announced as "transporting narcotics." According
    to Modafe, some of the defendants committed the crime for the first time.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. According to HRANA, during an interview with
    Radio Zamaneh, Mohammad Mostafa’i stated: “I think the process to
    investigate narcotics related cases is not right. For example, all rulings
    related to narcotics charges cannot be appealed. The only authority that
    can appeal these rulings is the General Public Prosecutor who is the
    public defender and the prosecutor.” Judgment No specific information is
    available about the defendant’s execution. Mr. Mohammad Azarfam, along
    with twelve others, was hanged at Qezelhesar prison in Karaj on June 7,
    2010. The ruling was carried out without the presence of the defendant’s
    attorney. The defendant’s family was not informed of the time of his
    execution.
