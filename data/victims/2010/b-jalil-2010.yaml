circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Jalil B., son of Khodakaram, was published on
    the website of Fars news agency on June 5, 2010, quoting the Head of
    Combating Narcotics Police in the Eastern Azarbaijan Province. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Jalil B. were announced as "supply and
    distribution of narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence presented against the defendant was announced as, “recovery
    of over 4 kilograms and 500 grams of crack [cocaine] and over 200 grams of
    opium from his home.” Defence No information is available on the
    defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Jalil B. to death
    and he was hanged at the Mianeh prison yard on June 5, 2010. No specific
    information is available about the defendant’s execution. Mr. Jalil B. was
    36 years old.
