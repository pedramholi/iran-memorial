    News of the execution of Mr. Azizollah, along with another person, was
    published on the websites of Esfahan Courthouse and the Kayhan newspaper
    on May 19, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Esfahan
    Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. This trial took place at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court in Esfahan. Charges The charges against Mr. Azizollah were announced
    as "transportation, assisting in transportation, and possession of
    narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against the defendant was announced as “possession of 132 kilograms and
    700 grams of opium, transporting 97 kilograms and 800 grams of opium, and
    having a previous record for narcotics.” Defence No information is
    available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Azizollah to death and confiscation of his belongings, and the ruling was
    confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor. The defendant’s request for
    pardon was twice denied by the Provincial Pardon Commission and he was
    hanged in the Esfahan Central prison yard. The exact date of the execution
    is unknown. Mr. Azizollah was 35 years old.
