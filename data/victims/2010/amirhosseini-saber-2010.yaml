    News of the execution of Mr. Saber Amirhosseini, a resident of Sanandaj,
    along with another person, was published on the website of HRANA (Human
    Rights Activists News Agency) on September 30, 2010. According to this
    report, the media inside Iran did not cover the news of this execution.
    Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s
    arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Saber Amirhosseini were announced
    as "transportation and possession of narcotics." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defence No information is available on the defendant’s defence. Judgment
    No specific information is available about the defendant's execution. Mr.
    Saber Amirhosseini was hanged at the central prison in Orumieh on
    September 28, 2010.
