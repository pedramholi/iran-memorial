    News of the conviction and execution of Mr. Mohammad Valizadeh, along with
    two others, was published on the websites of Fars news agency,
    Mazandnumeh, and Darya on April 14, the Iran newspaper on April 15, and
    Shomal News on February 26 and April 15, 2010. Mr. Valizadeh was 29, a
    resident of Kiakola in Mazandaran Province. During an interview with the
    Iran newspaper, Mr. Mohammad Valizadeh stated that he was the second child
    of a family of six. His family was kind to him, but he went to Bobolsar
    and began working in a car dealership to achieve financial independence
    and continue his education simultaneously at the age of seventeen. After
    three years, he bought a car and rented a house without his family’s
    knowledge. Arrest and Detention According to the Iran newspaper, quoting
    the Head of Police Information in Mazandaran, the investigation and search
    to identify defendants began in the summer of 2007 following a complaint
    by an individual. Finally Mr. Valizadeh along with two others was
    identified through computer image making: one of the defendants was
    identified and arrested on August 6, 2007. Soon after, the other two
    defendants were also arrested. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. This trial took place at the Punitive Court of
    Mazandaran in May of 2009. Charges The charges against Mr. Mohammad
    Valizadeh and two other defendants were announced as "kidnapping and
    rape." According to Mazandaran Police News Agency a pregnant woman went to
    the police station in Babolsar and complained. According to this woman, a
    stranger followed her and gave her his phone number. She contacted him in
    order to make him stop the harassment, but he threatened her. A few days
    later, when she left her house, the stranger forced her to ride in his
    vehicle. He took her to an unknown place, raped her, and abandoned her in
    a street. Sometime later, five female students went to the Intelligence
    Police and complained about three young men including Mr. Valizadeh. They
    claimed that these men schemed to their become friends, drugged them while
    drinking coffee, and raped them. According to this news agency 13 women
    and girls pressed charges against Mr. Valizadeh and the two others.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against the defendant was
    announced as "plaintiffs’ statements, physicians’ statements, and other
    evidence and documents." Defence During the investigation process, the
    defendants including Mr. Valizadeh denied the charges and stated that they
    were friends with the plaintiffs who went out with them of their own free
    will. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year
    Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad Valizadeh to
    15 years imprisonment for kidnapping and to death and lashes for rape. The
    ruling was confirmed by Branch 27 of the Supreme Court. The Judicial
    Pardon Commission rejected the defendant’s request for pardon and he was
    hanged at Emamali Square in Babolsar on April 14, 2010. Mr. Mohammad
    Valizadeh was 29 years old.
