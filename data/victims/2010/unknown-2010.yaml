    News of the execution of an unknown person was published on the website of
    the Kayhan newspaper on September 22, 2010. Arrest and Detention There is
    no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. According
    to the report, the defendant was arrested by the agents of Narcotics
    Combat Police in Aran and Bidgol in Esfahan province. The date of this
    arrest is unknown. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. Charges The charges against the defendant were announced as
    "transportation and possession of narcotics." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defence No information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment
    No specific information is available about the defendant’s execution. This
    defendant was hanged in Aran and Bidgol in Esfahan province. The exact
    date of this execution is unknown.
