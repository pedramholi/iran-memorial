    News of the execution of Mr. A. A. was published on the websites of Fars
    news agency on May 20, Ahvaz Popular Democratic Front on May 21, and
    Khuzestan Courthouse on May 22, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office
    of Khuzestan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place at the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz. Charges The charge against Mr. A. A.
    was announced as "smuggling narcotics." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against the defendant was
    announced as, “purchasing, selling, transporting, and possessing of one
    kilogram and 375 grams of heroin.” Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. A. A. to death
    and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was hanged in public
    at Kut’abdollah Road adjacent to Abadan Terminal in Ahvaz on May 20, 2010.
