    Arash was only 20. He was absurdly charged with fomenting unrest. News of
    the execution of Mr. Arash Rahmanipur and another individual was announced
    in various sources, including his chosen attorney s interviews with the
    media ( Voice of America and the International Campaign for Human Rights ,
    January 28, 2010), a public relations announcement of the Revolutionary
    and Public Prosecution Office of Tehran (January 28, 2010), and the Fars
    News Agency . Supplementary information about this case was collected from
    the websites of the Amir Kabir Newsletter (January 28, 2010), IRNA (August
    8, 2009), ISNA (August 8, 2009; February 1, 2010), Radio Farda (January
    30, 2010), Committee of Human Rights Reporters (October 10, 2009), the
    International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran (January 28, 2010; May 20,
    2010), Fararu (January 28, 2010), and HRANA (June 3, 2010). Mr. Arash
    Rahmanipur was 20 years old and single. According to his father, he
    believed in love for humanity and in spirituality and justice. He saw his
    homeland as his identity, as his whole life, and wished everyone would
    realize their duty towards the homeland. He loved Iran and took pleasure
    in poetry and literature. According to the information published, he was a
    supporter of a group called the Royal Association of Iran. The Royal
    Association of Iran supports the reestablishment of the monarchy in Iran,
    but it does not align itself with any of the existing royalist groups.
    According to a document titled the Constitution , this association calls
    for a monarchical system consisting of a council of advisors (elected
    parliament), a primary advisor (prime minister), and a king (who acts as
    the people s representative). According to this constitution, the country
    is governed through tribal, rural, and urban associations, and the
    government is based on equality, free education, socialist economy,
    freedom of expression (as well as thought and religion), and gender
    equality. The right to vote belongs to citizens who possess enough social
    consciousness and acumen. The leader of this group, Forud Fuladvand
    (Fathollah Manuchehri) started his activities in the early 2000 s by
    setting up a TV channel called Television-e Shoma [Your Television] in
    London, critiquing Islam and the Quran in its programs, and acquiring a
    modest following in Iran, with time. After a few protest activities in
    Europe, he set out for Iran to carry out what he described as an important
    operation called Tondar; but he disappeared in Turkey in January 17, 2002.
    The Association was divided into different branches following this
    incident. One offshoot in London is against recruiting members and against
    armed activity in any shape or form, while another in Los Angeles
    insistently calls for combative action through establishing Radio Tondar
    and accepting responsibility for some bomb explosions inside Iran. Both
    groups claim to be the representative of the Royal Association, and each
    group accuses the other one of being a part of the conspiracy aligned with
    the Islamic Republic of Iran's security forces. Security forces have -- at
    several points before and after the disappearance of Forud Fuladvand --
    arrested a number of young people accused of being supporters of the Royal
    Association and sentenced them to prison or death. The group trial was
    held in disregard of due process for Mr. Rahmanipur and many others
    arrested in relation to post-election protests, including tens of former
    high-ranking government officials; political, media, and student
    activists; and campaign organizers of the dissenting candidates, which
    provoked strong reactions -- both inside Iran and internationally -- and
    was criticized by lawyers, attorneys, and political and human rights
    activists, as well as international and human rights organizations. Arrest
    and Detention According to Nasrin Sotudeh, Mr. Rahmanipur s chosen
    attorney, he was arrested, along with his pregnant sister, at his home in
    Tehran on April 15, 2009, almost two months prior to the election, and
    both he and his family suffered much pressure and many false promises
    throughout his detention. He was only allowed one visit with his chosen
    attorney during his detention, which lasted several months. According to
    his attorney, interrogators pressured not just Mr. Rahmanipur himself but
    his whole family. Mr. Rahmanipur had told his attorney that -- in two of
    the interrogations in which his sister had also been present -- they had
    told him that if he wanted his sister to be released, he had to make the
    confessions that they asked of him. (International Campaign for Human
    Rights, January 28, 2010) Although his sister was released on acquittal
    after two months, she suffered a miscarriage as a result of the pressures
    endured during her detention. Trial Arash Rahmanipur was tried, in the
    absence of his chosen attorney, on August 8, 2009, in branch 15 of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran, presided by Judge Salavati. The
    security forces did not allow Ms. Nasrin
