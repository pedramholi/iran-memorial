    News of the execution of an unknown individual was published on the
    websites of the Khorasan-Shomali Courthouse and Fars news agency on July
    18, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Khorasan-Shomali
    Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The charges against the defendant were
    announced as “transportation and possession of 989 grams of
    methamphetamine.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available on the defendant’s defence. Judgment The court condemned this
    defendant to death and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public
    Prosecutor. The defendant’s request for pardon was rejected by the Pardon
    Commission of the Judiciary. He was hanged in Shirvan on July 17, 2010.
