    News of the execution of Mr. Reza Mohajer was published on the websites of
    Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran on August 1, and HRANA (Human
    Rights Activists News Agency) on August 2, 2010. According to these
    reports, Mr. Reza Mohajer had been awaiting execution for eleven years. He
    had been sent to the gallows three times and each time his execution had
    been postponed. On August 1, 2010, he was transferred to solitary
    confinement in Gohardasht (Raj’ishahr) prison in Karaj. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The charge against Mr. Reza Mohajer was announced as "murder." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    According to HRANA, the defendant’s father had been the plaintiff. Defence
    No information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court
    condemned Reza Mohajer to death and he was hanged at Gohardasht
    (Raja’ishahr) prison in Karaj on August 2, 2010.
