cause_of_death: "Execution » Hanging"
circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown individual was published on the
    website of IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on July 21, 2010, quoting
    the Deputy of the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office in
    Chaharmahal-va-Bakhtiari. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charges against the
    defendant were announced as "having a previous record, and recovery
    [possession] of 730 grams of heroin and 95 grams of hashish." The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned the defendant to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor. He
    was hanged in Shahr-e-kord on July 21, 2010.
