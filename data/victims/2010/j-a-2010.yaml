    News of the execution of Mr. A. J., along with two others, was published
    on the websites of Fars news agency and IRNA (Islamic Republic News
    Agency) on September 21, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of Yazd
    Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. This trial took place at Branch Two of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Yazd. Charges The charge against Mr. A. J. was
    announced as "smuggling narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The evidence presented against the defendant was announced as,
    “participation in hiding of 111 kilograms of heroin.” Defence No
    information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. A. J. to death and confiscation of his belongings and the
    ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor’s Office. His
    request for punishment reduction was denied by the Judiciary Pardon
    Commission. He was hanged at the central prison in Yazd on September 20,
    2010.
