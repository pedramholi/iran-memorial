    News of the execution of Mr. Gholamreza, along with two others, was
    published on the websites of IMNA (Isfahan Metropolis News Agency) on
    April 11, and Fars news agency on April 12, 2010, quoting the Public
    Relations Office of the Esfahan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is
    no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place
    at Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Esfahan. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Gholamreza was announced as "smuggling narcotics." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against the defendant was announced as “having a previous record of
    convictions for narcotics and other [offenses], participation in
    purchasing, transporting, possessing, and hiding 9 kilograms and 900 grams
    of crack [cocaine] in a truck.” Defence No information is available on the
    defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Gholamreza to death
    and confiscation of his belongings. The ruling was confirmed by the
    Supreme Court. The defendant’s request for pardon was rejected by the
    Provincial Pardon Commission twice and he was hanged in the yard of
    Esfahan Central Prison on April 11, 2010. Mr. Gholamreza was 38 years old.
