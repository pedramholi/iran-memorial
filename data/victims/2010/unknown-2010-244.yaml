    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with four others,
    was published on the websites of Fars news agency and ISNA (Iranian
    Students News Agency) on September 26, 2010, quoting the Public and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor of Tehran. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charges
    against the defendant were announced as "purchasing and selling
    narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought against the
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant’s defence. Judgment No specific information is available
    about the defendant’s execution. According to the Public and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor of Tehran, these five defendants were hanged in Tehran two or
    three days before the publication news date [September 26, 2010].
