    News of the execution of Mr. S. R. was published on the websites of the
    Khuzestan Courthouse on May 22 and 24, and Fars news agency on May 24,
    2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Khuzestan Courthouse.
    Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s
    arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. This trial took place at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz.
    Charges The charge against Mr. S. R. was announced as “transportation of
    675 grams of heroin.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available on the defendant’s defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. S.
    R. to death and he was hanged at the Karun prison in Ahvaz on May 23,
    2010.
