place_of_death: "Mashhad"
province: "Khorasan-e Razavi"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Hanging"
circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with four others,
    was published on the websites of ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on
    April 10, and the Khorasan newspaper on April 11, 2010, quoting the News
    and Information Unit of the Khorasan-Razavi Courthouse. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    This trial took place at the Revolutionary Court of Mashhad. Charges The
    charge against the defendant was announced as "smuggling narcotics." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against the defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against the defendant was announced as smuggling tens of kilograms of
    opium and heroin. Defence No information is available on the defendant s
    defence. Judgment The court condemned the defendant to death and the
    ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court and the General Public
    Prosecutor s Office. He was hanged in the Central Prison in Mashhad on
    April 8, 2010.
