    News of the execution of Ms. Behnaz Foruzandeh Del was published on the
    website of Zanjan Provincial Courthouse on October 10, 2010. Additional
    information was gathered from an interview by the Boroumand Foundation
    with Ms. Zeinab Bayazidi*, a cellmate of Ms. Foruzandehdel. Ms. Foruzandeh
    Del, 32, was a homemaker, a Kurd, and a resident of Orumieh. She was
    married with a twelve-year-old daughter. According to her cellmate, she
    was very kind and to some degree na ve. She always had a smile and helped
    other prisoners. However, after her sentence, she became nervous easily.
    Once before, she had been arrested along with her mother in Zanjan;
    however, they both were exonerated. (Interview with ABF) Arrest and
    detention Ms. Foruzandeh Del was arrested, along with her brother, on the
    road between Tehran and Zanjan in March of 2009. According to her, she was
    pregnant when arrested; however, her pregnancy was aborted due to the
    harsh treatment of officials and she was hospitalized during her first 20
    days of detention. She was transferred to the Zanjan Central Prison either
    on March 31, or April 1, 2009. The court rejected her request for transfer
    to the Orumieh Prison and she was detained in the Zanjan Central Prison
    until her execution. (Interview with ABF) Trial The Revolutionary Court of
    Zanjan tried Ms. Foruzandeh Del in 2010. No information is available on
    her trial or whether her appointed attorney was present. (Interview with
    ABF) Charges The charge against Ms. Foruzandeh Del was transportation of 2
    kilograms and 711 grams of heroin. (Zanjan Provincial Courthouse) The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to her
    cellmate, the evidence presented against Ms. Foruzandeh Del was the
    recovered narcotics when arrested and her confession. (Interview with ABF)
    Defense No information is available on Ms. Foruzandeh Del's defense or her
    attorney. According to her cellmate, the arresting agents asked her to be
    silent about her abortion during the arrest in exchange for a reduction in
    her punishment. She accepted all charges trusting what agents told her and
    in order to exonerate her brother. She even denied her religion as a Sunni
    and pretended to be a Shi a when entering the Women s Prison hoping to
    reduce her sentence. (Interview with ABF) Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Zanjan condemned Ms. Behnaz Foruzandeh Del to death
    for transporting narcotics. According to the website of Zanjan Provincial
    Courthouse, the General Public Prosecutor confirmed the ruling. She was
    hanged, along with three others, at the Zanjan Central Prison yard on
    October 9, 2010 at dawn, without the presence of her attorney or her
    family. According to her cellmate, she was not informed of her execution
    time. On the day before, after visiting with her brother, Ms. Foruzandeh
    Del and five other women had been taken to the Quarantine Section of the
    prison on the pretence to transfer them to the Narcotics Men's Section.
    The next day, Ms. Foruzandeh Del was forcefully taken to the gallows.
    According to her cellmate, she insisted to talk to her daughter but this
    was not allowed. (Interview with ABF) Her body was given to her family for
    burial and mourning. She was buried in Orumieh. _________________________
