    News of the execution of Mr. Gh. B., along with another person, was
    published on the websites of the Kayhan newspaper on March 1, and IRNA
    (Islamic Republic News Agency) on March 8, 2010, quoting the Public
    Relations Office of the Lorestan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is
    no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. According
    to the Kayhan newspaper, these two defendants were arrested in Khorramabad
    on February 16, 2008. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. This trial took place at Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Khorramabad. Charges The charges against Mr. Gh. B. were
    announced as "purchasing and transporting 3 kilograms and 990 grams of
    crack [cocaine] and 3 kilograms and 9 grams of heroin." The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against the defendant was his
    “confession”. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of torture to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defence
    No information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Gh. B. to death and confiscation of his belongings. The
    ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor’s Office and the
    Pardon Commission. He was hanged at the Training and Job Center of
    Lorestan on March 2, 2010.
