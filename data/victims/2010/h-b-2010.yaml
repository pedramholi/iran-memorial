    News of the execution of Mr. B. H. was published on the website of
    Khabare-Jonub on March 1, 2010. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. According to the
    report, the defendant had been arrested several years before. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. This case was first
    sent to the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Estahban and the trial took
    place at the Punitive Court of Estahban. Charges The charges against Mr.
    B. H. were announced as "having a long criminal record, kidnapping, rape,
    and armed robbery." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against the defendant was his “confession”. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of torture to obtain confessions
    from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions
    obtained under duress. Defence No information is available on the
    defendant's defence. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Estahban
    identified Mr. B. H. as Mohareb (fighter) and condemned him to death. The
    ruling was confirmed by Branch 31 of the Supreme Court. He was hanged at
    the Adelabad prison in Shiraz. The exact date of this execution is
    unknown.
