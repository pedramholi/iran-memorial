    News of the execution of Mr. Hamid Sh., along with five others, was
    published on the websites of Esfahan Courthouse on January 3 and 10,
    General Office of Esfahan prisons on January 12, and Fars news agency on
    January 9, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Esfahan
    Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Hamid Sh. were
    announced as "purchasing and possession of opium." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against the defendant was
    announced as possession of 38 kilograms and 650 grams of opium when
    arrested, and having two previous criminal records. Defence No information
    is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Hamid Sh. to death and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public
    Prosecutor. After the defendant s requests for pardon were denied twice,
    he was hanged in the Esfahan Central prison yard on January 9, 2010. Mr.
    Hamid Sh. was 39 years old.
