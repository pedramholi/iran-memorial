    News of the execution of Mr. Y. S., along with four others, was published
    on the websites of Fars news agency on August 7, and Khuzestan Courthouse
    on August 9, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of Khuzestan
    Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. This trial took place at Branch One of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz in Izeh. Charges The charge against Mr. Y. S.
    was announced as "smuggling narcotics." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against the defendant was
    announced as, “possession of 200 kilograms of opium and attempting to sell
    69.15 kilograms of opium.” Defence No information is available on the
    defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Y. S. to death and
    the ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor’s Office. He was
    hanged at Karun prison in Ahvaz on August 7, 2010.
