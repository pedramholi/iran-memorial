    News of the execution of Mr. Siamand Mirza, along with his brother and two
    others, was published on the websites of the Zanjan Provincial Courthouse
    and Fars news agency on October 10, 2010. Additional information was taken
    from an interview by the Abdorrahman Bouroumand Foundation with Ms. Zeinab
    Bayazidi, * a women s rights activist who was imprisoned at the Zanjan
    Prison at the same time. (ABF interview) Mr. Mirza, a Sunni Kurd from
    Iraq, was married with a son. He had a middle-school education and was a
    simple worker. He had migrated from Iraq to Iran during Saddam s regime.
    He was well known as a generous and selfless person among the prisoners.
    During a prison search, he took the responsibility for some recovered
    narcotics, belonging to another prisoner, in order to save that person's
    visitation and phone call rights. (ABF interview) Mr. Mirza was wanted for
    his previous record related to narcotics, and planned to leave Iran and
    return to Kurdistan in Iraq. (ABF interview) Arrest and detention Mr.
    Mirza was arrested in the judicial district of the Zanjan province in
    2003. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. He was
    detained at the Zanjan Central Prison until his execution. His wife, also
    a defendant of the same case, was detained in the Women's Section of the
    same prison. (ABF interview) Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Zanjan tried Mr. Mirza. No information is available on his trial.
    According to his wife, this case had 70 defendants. (ABF interview)
    Charges The charges brought against Mr. Mirza were announced as dealing
    and smuggling narcotics and weapons. (the website of Zanjan Provincial
    Courthouse) According to the ABF interview, Mr. Mirza and his brother,
    Qahreman, had been additionally charged with a shooting that resulted in
    the murder of an arresting officer during a chase. The murder charge was
    read when the sentence was carried out. (ABF interview) The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt According to the Zanjan Provincial Courthouse, the
    evidence presented against Mr. Mirza was dealing 3 kilograms and 450 grams
    of heroin and possessing a combat weapon. Additionally, the courthouse
    emphasized that some of the four defendants had records related to
    narcotics. (the website of Zanjan Provincial Courthouse) According to the
    ABF interview, Mr. Mirza s confession was among the evidence presented in
    the court. He took the responsibility of narcotics in order to save his
    wife and other defendants of this case. (ABF interview) Defense According
    to the ABF interview with Ms. Bayazidi, Mr. Mirza and his brother rejected
    the charge of shooting to death an arresting officer. They claimed that
    the mentioned officer had been killed during a traffic accident two months
    after their arrest. No other information is available on Mr. Mirza s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Zanjan condemned Mr.
    Siamand Mirza to death and the General Public Prosecutor confirmed the
    ruling (the website of Zanjan Provincial Courthouse). He was hanged, along
    with three others, including his brother, Qahreman Mirza, without the
    presence of his attorney or his family at the Zanjan Central Prison yard
    on October 10, 2010 at dawn. According to the existing information, before
    his execution, Mr. Mirza requested to visit his baby, who was with his
    mother in the prison, but was denied this last visitation. (ABF interview)
    His family was informed after Mr. Mirza s execution. According to the
    family, when his father went to Zanjan to know the fate of his sons, he
    died due to the shock of the bad news. (ABF interview)
    _________________________ *On July 9, 2008, Ms. Zeinab Bayazidi, a Kurdish
    women s rights activist, was condemned to four years imprisonment in
    addition to six months imprisonment in Maragheh for propaganda against the
    regime, membership in the Mothers' Reconciliation Association in Mahabad,
    and having connections with the Kurdish parties. She was released after
    completing her sentence on November 20, 2012.
