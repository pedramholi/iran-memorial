    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Na im Sh., along with two others,
    was published on the website of Kerman Courthouse on July 18, 2010. The
    website of Baluchestan Human Rights Activists, Radio Baluch FM, also
    reported this execution on the same date and stated the defendant s name
    as Na im Shahbakhsh. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information
    on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant s trial. This trial took place at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court in Kerman. Charges According to the website of Kerman
    Courthouse, the charge against Mr. Mohammad Na im Sh. (Shahbakhsh) was
    announced as "selling opium." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence presented against the defendant was announced as "selling 275
    kilograms of opium." Defence No information is available on the
    defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad Na im Sh.
    (Shahbakhsh) to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court.
    The Provincial Pardon Commission rejected the defendant s requests for
    pardon and he was hanged in the Kerman prison on July 18, 2010.
