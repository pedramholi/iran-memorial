circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Akbar H. was published on the websites of
    Sistan and Baluchestan Courthouse on June 16, and Fars news agency on June
    15, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Sistan Va Baluchestan
    Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Akbar H. were announced
    as "murder and rape." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Akbar H. to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Judiciary. He was hanged
    in the Zahedan prison on June 15, 2010.
