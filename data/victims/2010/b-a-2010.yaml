    News of the execution of Mr. A. B., along with another person, was
    published on the website of Fars news agency on August 1and Khuzestan
    Courthouse on August 2, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Khuzestan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place at the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Dezful. Charges The charges against Mr. A.
    B. were announced as "transportation and possession of 97 grams of
    extracted heroin (crack cocaine)." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. A. B. to death and the ruling was confirmed by the General
    Public Prosecutor’s Office. He was hanged at the Dezful prison on July 31,
    2010.
