    News of the execution of Mr. Arsalan Asadi, son of Amanollah, along with
    five others, was published on the websites of the Kayhan and Iran
    newspapers on May 9, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. Additional information was taken
    from two electronic forms sent to the Omid memorial by a person close to
    him. According to the existing information, Mr. Asadi was born in Eslam
    Abad-e Gharb in 1973. He was a high school graduate, married with two
    children. Arrest and detention According to the information sent to Omid,
    Mr. Asadi was arrested in Tehran and detained at the detention center of
    the Intelligence Ministry in Tehran. The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial According to the information sent to Omid,
    Branch 15 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Asadi in a show
    trial. No information is available on his trial. Charges According to the
    newspaper reports, the charges brought against Mr. Asadi were announced as
    transportation of 156 kilograms of morphine and 110 kilograms of opium.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the
    information sent to Omid, no evidence was presented against Mr. Asadi.
    Defense According to the information sent to Omid, Mr. Asadi was not
    allowed to defend himself. Judgment A court condemned Mr. Arsalan Asadi to
    death and he was hanged at the Qezelhesar Prison in Karaj on May 8, 2010
    (newspaper reports). No specific information is available about this
    execution.
