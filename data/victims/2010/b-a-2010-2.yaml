circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. A. B. was published on the website of
    Khuzestan Courthouse on August 17, 2010, quoting the Public Relations
    Office of the Khuzestan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place
    at Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Dezful. Charges The
    charge against Mr. A. B. was announced as "smuggling narcotics." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. A. B. to death
    and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor’s Office. He
    was hanged at the Dezful prison on August 11, 2010.
