    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with two others, was
    published on the website of ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on
    September 29, 2010, quoting the Head of the judiciary. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    According to the Head of the judiciary, this case was sent to Tehran for
    investigation after 18 days. Charges The charge against the defendant was
    announced as "rape." According to the Head of the judiciary, several young
    men went to a house in a village in the Khorasan-Jonubi province and raped
    a young girl in front of her parents in the month of Ramadan. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against the defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defence No information is available on the defendant’s defence. Judgment
    The court condemned the defendant to death. According to ISNA, quoting the
    Head of the judiciary, “these three individuals were executed in spite of
    the fact that we normally do not execute anyone in the month of Ramadan.”
    No specific information is available about the defendants' execution. The
    exact date of these executions is unknown.
