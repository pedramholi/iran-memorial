    News of the conviction and execution of Mr. Mehdi N., known as Shahnu,
    along with four others, was published on the website of Kerman Courthouse
    on January 23 and April 17, 2010. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place
    at the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Kerman. Charges The charges against
    Mr. Mehdi N. were announced as "armed transportation of opium and 13
    previous records for fighting, sedition, kidnapping, hostage taking,
    shooting citizens and police agents, resulting in death in Bam and
    surrounding area since 2001." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence presented against the defendant was announced as
    "transportation of 600 kilograms of opium." Defence No information is
    available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Mehdi N. to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He
    was hanged in the Kerman prison on April 17, 2010.
