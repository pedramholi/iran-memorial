    News of the execution of Mr. S. M., along with two others, was published
    on the websites of the Khuzestan Courthouse on July 25, and IRNA (Islamic
    Republic News Agency) in Khuzestan on July 24, 2010, quoting the Public
    Relations Office of the Khuzestan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There
    is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant s trial. This trial took
    place at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz. Charges The charge
    against Mr. S. M. was announced as possession of 43 grams of heroin. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant s defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. S. M. to death
    and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor s Office. He
    was hanged at the Karun prison in Ahvaz on July 24, 2010.
