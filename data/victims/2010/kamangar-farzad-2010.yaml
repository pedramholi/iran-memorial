    Twelve years he taught in Kamyaran and was a member of bio-ecological and
    educational bodies. He wrote, with eloquence, of pluralism in society and
    the basic rights of citizens. News of the execution of Mr. Farzad
    Kamangar, son of Baqi, and four others was announced by the public
    relations department of Tehran's Public and Revolution Courts. Information
    regarding Mr Kamangar's arrest and sentence was posted on several news
    websites, including Human Rights Activists in Iran (13 March), Amir Kabir
    Newsletter (26 February) 2008, Human Rights Watch of Kurdistan (11, 19
    October) 2008; and Haft-e Tir website (22 July) 2008, Amnesty
    International (12 January), ISNA news agency (29 April), Green Movement
    (10 and 20 May), Committee of Human Rights Reporters (9 May and 6 June),
    Campaign for the Release of Farzad Kamangar (2 and 10 May), Fars news
    agency (17 May), Radio Farda (26 May), Harana (1 and 11 June), 2010.
    Additional information has been taken from the testimony of Sabah Nasri, a
    former cellmate of Mr Kamanger, in an interview with Iran Human Rights
    Documentation Center (22 February 2011). Among the main sources used to
    put together Kamangar's story have been two of his letters: one, dated 23
    November 2007, was related to his arrest and interrogation, and the other,
    dated 4 February 2010, was addressed to the head of the Judiciary. The two
    letters were sent from Evin Prison and published by Harana (the website of
    Human Rights Activists in Iran). In his first letter from prison, Mr
    Kamangar introduced himself as follows: I, Farzad Kamangar, known as
    Siamand, have worked as a teacher in the town of Kamyaran [in the Iranian
    province of Kurdistan] for 12 years. A year before my arrest [July 2006],
    I started teaching at the Kar-o-Danesh Vocational High School. I was also
    a member of the Board of Directors of the Kamyaran branch of the Teachers
    Union and in charge of its public relations before it was banned by the
    authorities. In addition, I was a member of the editorial board of Ruyan,
    a cultural-educational monthly published by the Education Department in
    Kamyaran (this publication was eventually banned by Herasat [the
    intelligence and security organization monitoring public offices]). For a
    while, I was a member of the board directors of the Bio-Ecological Society
    of Kamyaran (Ausk), and when the [Kurdistan] Human Rights Organization
    started its activities in 2005, I signed up to be a reporter for this
    organization. Farzad Kamangar believed in peaceful civil resistance as a
    means of eliminating discrimination based on belief. He shunned violence.
    Farzad loved Kurdistan and deemed the intensity of state violence against
    the Kurdish minority in Iran as not only an act of oppression but also a
    political mistake. His perspective on tribal and ethnic minorities was
    this: "The presence of tribal and ethnic minorities in Iran and the rest
    of the world is not a new phenomenon. Ethnic, cultural and tribal
    pluralism in a society could act as a double-edged sword for that society.
    It means that in a situation where a society is developed and where
    relationships are based on fairness and equality, co-existence of various
    tribes and ethnic groups does not lead to any problems; moreover, it could
    actually be conducive to enriching that society culturally by raising the
    level of tolerance, on the one hand, and reducing cultural prejudices and
    individual bigotries, on the other. Today, particularly in the era of
    globalization, the tedious shadow of cultural monotony poses a threat to
    many societies. The existence of this cultural pluralism and diversity is
    a gift that should be cherished. At the same time, in a situation where
    the leaders of a society fail to pay sufficient attention to the needs and
    legitimate rights of its minorities, troublesome repercussions are
    inevitable. Perhaps one of the basic rights that every Iranian, Kurdish or
    otherwise, feels entitled to is the right to 'citizenship'; a right that
    stands against seclusion and exclusion. Seclusion and exclusion are two
    sentiments formed from the influence of objective circumstances, or in
    other words, the tangible and day to day realities of life, such as
    poverty as seen in the fading light in a starving child s eyes, the shame
    of a father whose pockets are empty, who hence cannot provide food on the
    table for his family, or the pale cheeks and poverty-stricken countenance
    of a mother. (Farzad Kamangar: We Are All People, dated 10 April 2010) In
    joining the Human Rights Activists in Iran, which seeks to champion human
    rights and eliminate religious, ethnic and gender discriminations, Farzad
    Kamangar had chosen the path of non-violent civil resistance. Mr Kamangar
    is described as charismatic and kind by those who knew him. Describing
    Farzad Kamangar, one of his cellmates noted He had a unique softness in
    his emotions and his writings. He was one of those loveable myths. Someone
    who liked to help those who were deprived from education; those who could
    build the futu
