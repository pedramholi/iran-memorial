circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with another person,
    was published on the website of Pana news agency on April 7, and the
    Kayhan newspaper on April 13, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of
    the Khuzestan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charge against the
    defendant was announced as "smuggling narcotics." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against the defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defence No information is available on the defendant s defence. Judgment
    He was hanged in public at Shahrdari Square in Shadegan on April 7, 2010.
    No specific information is available about the defendant s execution.
