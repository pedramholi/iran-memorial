quotes:
  - "this will pass too."
  - "The tortures to which you have subjected me have become my nightmares. I spent every day in pain from the torture. Blows to my head during interrogation have given my severe head trauma. There are days when I am struck with the most agonizing headaches. My nose starts to bleed, and I lose awareness of my surroundings. It takes several hours before I gradually regain consciousness. Another 'gift' of their torture was the damage to my eyesight, which is worsening every day. My request for eyeglasses has remained unanswered."
  - "When they realized my resolve to continue with the hunger strike, they attempted to forcibly feed me by shoving serums and tubes into my stomach through my nose. I would resist by pulling out the tubes, which resulted in bleeding and tremendous pain. After some two years, the scars remain and bother me."
  - "One day during interrogations, they kicked me so hard in the stomach that I immediately started to bleed. One day one of the interrogators approached me, asking irrelevant questions. He was the only interrogator I saw, as at other times I was in blindfolds. When I failed to respond, he slapped me, drew a gun from his belt and put it to my head. He said: 'Answer my questions. I know you are a member of PJAK and a terrorist. Look girl! It makes no difference whether or not you talk. We are happy to have taken a PJAK member captive."
  - "They would make me stand on my injured feet until they would become totally swollen. Then they would bring me some ice."

    Born to a Kurdish family, she knew carpet weaving by early in her
    childhood. Speaking and writing Persian came only much later. Those she
    met in the capital noticed her cheerful spirit and resilience. News of the
    execution of Ms. Shirin Alamhuli Atashgah, daughter of Khadar, and four
    others* was announced by the public relations department of Tehran's
    Public and Revolution Courts. The information regarding her arrest and
    detention was drawn from the following sources: Ms. Alamhuli's letters
    from prison, ISNA, Committee of Human Rights Reporters, The Wall Street
    Journal, Modafe' [personal website of [human rights defender Mohammad
    Mostafa'ie] (9 May), Kurdish Perspective (7 and 15 May), Fars News Agency
    (17 May), Halt Execution of Ms. Shirin Alamhuli-Atashgah (7 May), Bidaran
    website (19 May) 2010, Rahana (31 January, 3 February 2010), Iran-e Emruz
    (25 February 2010), Orumieh.com (16 January 2010), and Radio Farda (9 May
    2011). Shirin Alamhuli-Atashgah was born on 3 June 1981 in the village of
    Gheslagh, near the city of Maku [in the predominantly Azeri and Kurdish
    speaking West Azerbaijan Province], to an impoverished family. She was
    illiterate and skilled in carpet weaving. One of her cellmates, Ms.
    Haratounian, remembers her as: "a very generous girl with a perpetual
    smile. Even in the most appalling situations, she would smile and say,
    'this will pass too.' I cannot get this catchphrase of hers out of my
    mind. She was a guardian angel with a free spirit. Shirin was a free
    spirit in the real sense of the word." According to Mr Bahramian, one of
    her lawyers, Ms. Alamhuli-Atashgah, who didn t speak any Persian at the
    time of her arrest, had briefly attended Literacy Movement classes. She
    had merely learned to sign her name, but she is an intelligent girl and
    has recently managed to complete the fifth grade of primary school in
    prison. She has promised me to continue her education to university
    level." Arrest and detention Ms. Alamhuli-Atashgah was arrested on 26 May
    2008 by the [Islamic] Revolutionary Guards Corps [IRGC]. After enduring 25
    days of torture and detention, she was transferred to Evin Prison.
    Following six months' imprisonment, she was transferred to Evin's Women s
    Ward. According to Fars News Agency, she was arrested in connection with
    an explosion at the headquarters of the IRGC. Ms. Alamhuli-Atashgah
    reported that no arrest warrant was presented to her and that during her
    detention in the IRGC headquarters, she had no access to a lawyer. She
    also described the harsh prison conditions and the torture she was
    subjected to in several letters. On 18 January 2010, she wrote: "I was
    arrested in May 2008 by several military and plainclothes officers and
    taken directly to the IRGC headquarters. Upon arrival, they promptly
    proceeded to beat me. I spent a total of 25 days in IRGC custody, 22 days
    of which I was on hunger strike. During that period, I was constantly
    subjected to all kinds of physical and psychological pressure. The
    interrogators, who were male, handcuffed me to a bed. They repeatedly
    struck me on my face, body and soles of my feet with electric batons,
    cables, kicks and punches. At the time, I could barely speak or understand
    any Persian. So when their questions remained unanswered, they would beat
    me so hard that I would pass out. At Call to Prayers, they would go for
    their prayers, giving me time to, in their words, think about my conduct.
    Then it would start all over again: the beatings, passing out, ice
    water..." "The tortures to which you have subjected me have become my
    nightmares. I spent every day in pain from the torture. Blows to my head
    during interrogation have given my severe head trauma. There are days when
    I am struck with the most agonizing headaches. My nose starts to bleed,
    and I lose awareness of my surroundings. It takes several hours before I
    gradually regain consciousness. Another 'gift' of their torture was the
    damage to my eyesight, which is worsening every day. My request for
    eyeglasses has remained unanswered." "When they realized my resolve to
    continue with the hunger strike, they attempted to forcibly feed me by
    shoving serums and tubes into my stomach through my nose. I would resist
    by pulling out the tubes, which resulted in bleeding and tremendous pain.
    After some two years, the scars remain and bother me." "One day during
    interrogations, they kicked me so hard in the stomach that I immediately
    started to bleed. One day one of the interrogators approached me, asking
    irrelevant questions. He was the only interrogator I saw, as at other
    times I was in blindfolds. When I failed to respond, he slapped me, drew a
    gun from his belt and put it to my head. He said: 'Answer my questions. I
