    News of the execution of Mr. H. D., along with two others, was published
    on the websites of the Khuzestan Courthouse and Fars news agency on
    October 17, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Khuzestan
    Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. This trial took place at Branch 17 of the Penal Court
    of Khuzestan. Charges The charge against Mr. H. D. was announced as “an
    act incompatible with chastity.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant’s defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. H. D. to death
    and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was hanged at the
    Karun prison in Ahvaz on October 16, 2010.
