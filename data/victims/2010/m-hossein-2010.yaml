    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein M. was published on the websites of
    Esfahan Province Courthouse on November 5, and Fars news agency on
    November 27, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of Esfahan
    Courthouse. Arrest and Detention According to the media reports, several
    complaints were filed by women regarding kidnapping, robbery, and rape in
    Malekshahr judicial district in 2009. Four months later, the defendant's
    vehicle was identified by a plaintiff and the driver was arrested. He
    identified his two collaborators. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Hossein M. were
    announced as "raping and robbing women and girls." According to the
    websites of Esfahan Province Courthouse, these three defendants, using a
    vehicle as a taxi, took their victims to a secluded area and raped them.
    On some occasions, they robbed them, too. According to this report, the
    defendant was the driver and leader of the gang. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence presented against the defendant and two others was “their
    confession, complaints of plaintiffs, coroner's report, and other evidence
    stated in the indictment.” Defence No information is available on the
    defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hossein M. to death
    as the first row defendant and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme
    Court. He was hanged at the Esfahan central prison yard. The exact date of
    this execution is unknown.
