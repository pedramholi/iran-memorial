place_of_death: "Torbat-e Jam"
province: "Khorasan-e Razavi"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Hanging"
circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with eleven others,
    was published on the websites of ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) in
    Khorasan-Jonubi on November 29, and the Qods newspaper on November 30,
    2010. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The charge against the defendant was announced
    as "smuggling narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available on the defendant’s defence. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the defendant’s execution. According to the media reports,
    these twelve individuals were hanged at the Torbate-Jam prison weeks
    before the news publication date. According the attorney for two of the
    defendants, these rulings were carried out against the stipulation of the
    law. They were carried out abnormally, without informing attorneys and
    families of the defendants, in an unlawful time frame. Based on Article 7
    of the Sentence Execution Law, officials should inform the attorney to be
    present at the location of the execution at least 48 hours before the
    ruling is carried out.
