circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Gh. F., along with three others, was
    published on the websites of Fars news agency on December 25, and the
    Kayhan newspaper on December 26, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office
    of Khuzestan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Gh.
    F. was announced as "acts incompatible with chastity." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Gh.
    F. to death and he was hanged at Karun prison in Ahvaz on December 25,
    2010.
