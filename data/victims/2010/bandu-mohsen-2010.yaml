    News of the execution of Mr. Mohsen Bandu, along with seven others, was
    published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on
    September 21, 2015. This report collected names of 13 individuals who had
    been condemned to death for committing crimes when they were under the age
    of 18. Mr. Bandu was only 14 when the crime took place. International laws
    have strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were under
    the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the
    Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of
    the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an
    offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Bandu was detained for 4 years. The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Bandu s
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Bandu was announced as rape.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Bandu. Defense Mr. Bandu was under the age of 18 when the crime took
    place. No information is available on his defense. Judgment Mr. Mohsen
    Bandu was hanged in Bandar-e Abbas Prison in 2010. No specific information
    is available about his execution.
