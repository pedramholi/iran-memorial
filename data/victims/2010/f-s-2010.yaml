    News of the execution of Mr. S. F., along with two others, was published
    on the website of Fars news agency on September 20, 2010, quoting the
    Public Relations Office of Khuzestan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial
    took place at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Abadan. Charges The
    charge against Mr. S. F. was announced as "smuggling narcotics." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against the defendant was announced as, “selling, transporting, and
    possessing of 146 grams of heroin.” Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. S. F. to death
    and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor’s Office. He
    was hanged at Karun prison in Ahvaz on September 20, 2010.
