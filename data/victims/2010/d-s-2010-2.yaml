    News of the execution of Mr. S. D., along with another person, was
    published on the website of Khuzestan Courthouse on August 2 and Fars news
    agency on August 3, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Khuzestan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place at the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Mahshahr in Behbahan. Charges The charges
    against Mr. S. D. were announced as "purchasing one kilogram heroin and
    transporting 650 grams of the purchased heroin inside his body." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. S. D. to death
    and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was hanged at the
    Behbahan prison on July 31, 2010.
