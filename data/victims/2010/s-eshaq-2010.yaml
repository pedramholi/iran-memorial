    News of the execution of Mr. Eshaq S., along with three others, was
    published on the websites of Esfahan Courthouse on July 5, Iscanews on
    July 6, and Fars news agency on July 7, 2010, quoting the Public Relations
    Office of the Esfahan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place
    in Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Esfahan. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Eshaq S. were announced as "possession of crack, white
    heroin, and burned opium." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence presented against the defendant was announced as “possession
    of one kilogram and 325 grams of crack, 197 grams of heroin, and 250 grams
    of burned opium.” Defence No information is available on the defendant's
    defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Eshaq S. to death and the ruling
    was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor. After the defendant’s
    requests for pardon were denied twice, he was hanged in the Esfahan
    Central prison yard on July 5, 2010. Mr. Eshaq S. was 25 years old.
