    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with nine others,
    was published on the websites of the Central Provincial Courthouse on
    October 18, and Fars news agency on October 11, 2010, quoting the Public
    and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Arak. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge
    against the defendant was announced as "smuggling narcotics." According to
    the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Arak, two of these defendants
    were brothers who were also charged with rape and extortion. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against the defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant’s defence. Judgment No specific information is available
    about the defendant’s execution. According to the media report, these ten
    defendants were hanged in 2010.
