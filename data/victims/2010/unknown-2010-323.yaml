    News of the execution of two unknown individuals was published on the
    website of the Qods newspaper on April 27, 2010. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charge against the defendant was announced as "forceful acts incompatible
    with chastity." According to the Qods newspaper, the defendant had
    deceived a young boy and raped him in Mashhad. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence presented against the defendant was “complaint of the
    plaintiff and his own confession.” International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of torture to obtain confessions
    from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions
    obtained under duress. Defence No information is available on the
    defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned the defendant to death
    and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was hanged at the
    Central Prison in Mashhad. The exact date of this execution is unknown.
