    News of the execution of Mr. Mas’ud, along with four others, was published
    on the websites of the Iran newspaper on June 9, and Fars news agency on
    June 10, 2010, quoting the Public Prosecutor of Qom. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial
    took place at the Revolutionary Court. Charges The charges against Mr.
    Mas’ud were announced as "having a previous record, and transportation,
    possession, and selling of 8 kilograms of heroin.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defence No information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Mas’ud to death and the ruling was confirmed by
    the General Public Prosecutor’s Office. The defendant’s request for pardon
    was rejected at the Pardon Commission. He was hanged at the Central Prison
    in Qom on June 8, 2010. Mr. Mas’ud was 33 years old.
