    News of the execution of Mr. Abbas Y., along with two others, was
    published on the website of Kerman Courthouse on July 18, 2010. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    This trial took place at the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Kerman.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Abbas Y. were announced as "transportation
    and possession of crack." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence presented against the defendant was announced as "possession
    of 5 kilograms and 720 grams of crack [cocaine]." Defence No information
    is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Abbas Y. to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. The
    Provincial Pardon Commission rejected the defendant s requests for pardon
    and he was hanged in the Kerman prison on July 18, 2010.
