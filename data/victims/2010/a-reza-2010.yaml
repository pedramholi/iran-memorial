    News of the execution of Mr. Reza A. was published on the websites of the
    Esfahan Courthouse and the Iran newspaper on June 7, 2010, quoting the
    Public Relations Office of the Esfahan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial
    took place at Branch Four of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Esfahan.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Reza A. were announced as “possession of
    172 grams of crack and using it.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available on the defendant’s defence. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Reza A. to death and the ruling was confirmed by the General
    Public Prosecutor on June 21, 2009. The defendant’s request for pardon was
    rejected twice. He was hanged at the central prison yard in Esfahan on
    June 6, 2010. Mr. Reza A. was 26 years old.
