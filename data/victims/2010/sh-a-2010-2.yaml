    News of the execution of Mr. A. Sh. was published on the websites of Fars
    news agency and Iscanews on July 19, 2010. Arrest and Detention There is
    no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place
    at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz. Charges The charge against
    Mr. A. Sh. was announced as "smuggling narcotics." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against the defendant was
    announced as, “purchasing, selling, transporting, and possessing 73 grams
    of heroin and 423 grams of crack[cocaine].” Defence No information is
    available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. A.
    Sh. to death and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public
    Prosecutor’s Office. He was hanged in public at Kuyeh Mash’ali in Ahvaz on
    July 19, 2010.
