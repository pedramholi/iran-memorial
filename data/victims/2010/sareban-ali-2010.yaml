    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Sareban, along with four others, was
    published on the websites of HRANA on July 5 and 16, and Rojehlat on July
    15, 2010. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Ali Sareban and four
    others was collectively announced as "smuggling narcotics." The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment No specific information is available
    about the defendant’s execution. Mr. Ali Sareban was hanged at the Central
    Prison in Orumieh on July 15, 2010. According to the Rojehlat report,
    these five defendants had been sent to solitary confinement to be executed
    15 days earlier. However, authorities postponed the execution when 2000
    residents of Orumieh gathered and protested the ruling. According to HRANA
    on July 5, 2010, these five defendants were transferred to solitary
    confinement to be executed.
