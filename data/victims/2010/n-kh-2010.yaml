    News of the execution of Mr. Kh. N., along with three others, was
    published on the websites of Yazd Provincial Courthouse on May 30,
    Afghanistan Information Network and the English website of Ariana on May
    29, 2010. According to Ariana, these four defendants were Afghans;
    however, there is no mention of their nationality on the website of Yazd
    Provincial Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place in Branch Two
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Yazd. Charges The charges against
    the defendant were announced as "participation in transportation and
    possession of narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    According to the website of Yazd Provincial Courthouse, the evidence
    presented against the defendant and two others was “possession of 67
    kilograms of crack [cocaine], 120 kilograms of hashish, 36 kilograms of
    opium, and 7 kilograms of heroin.” Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. According to Afghanistan Information Network,
    quoting Abdolraman, the father of one of the defendants, his son had gone
    to Iran for work two years earlier. He was neither an addict nor a drug
    dealer. Iranian police arrested and executed him without any proof.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Kh. N. to death and confiscation of his
    belongings, except for his family’s cost of living. The ruling was
    confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor’s Office. The request for
    reduction of punishment was denied by the Pardon Commission of the
    judiciary and he was hanged in the central prison of Yazd on May 26, 2010.
    According to the Ariana website, the bodies of this defendant and the
    three other Afghans were given to Afghan officials at the border.
