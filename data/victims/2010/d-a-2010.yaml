    News of the execution of Mr. A. D., along with two others, was published
    on the websites of Fars news agency and IRNA (Islamic Republic News
    Agency) on September 21, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of Yazd
    Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. This trial took place at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Bafq. Charges The charge against Mr. A. D. was announced as
    "smuggling narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence presented against the defendant was announced as,
    “transportation and possession of 1,520 kilograms of opium and 60
    kilograms of heroin.” Defence No information is available on the
    defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. A. D. to death and
    confiscation of his belongings and the ruling was confirmed by the General
    Public Prosecutor’s Office. His request for punishment reduction was
    denied by the Judiciary Pardon Commission. He was hanged at the central
    prison in Yazd on September 20, 2010.
