    News of the execution of Mr. S. Z., along with two others, was published
    on the websites of the Khuzestan Courthouse on July 25, and IRNA (Islamic
    Republic News Agency) in Khuzestan on July 23, 2010, quoting the Public
    Relations Office of the Khuzestan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There
    is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took
    place at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz. Charges The charges
    against Mr. S. Z. were announced as “transportation and possession of 335
    grams of heroin.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available on the defendant’s defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. S.
    Z. to death and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public
    Prosecutor’s Office. He was hanged at the Karun prison in Ahvaz on July
    23, 2010.
