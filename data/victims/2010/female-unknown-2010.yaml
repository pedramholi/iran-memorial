    News of the execution of an unknown woman, along with four men, was

    on May 26, 2010. According to this source, news of the execution of these
    five individuals spread among the public in Rasht over days, but the

    No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No
    information is available on the defendant’s charges. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in

    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities

    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
