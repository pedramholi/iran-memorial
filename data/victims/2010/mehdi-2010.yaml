    News of the execution of Mr. Mehdi, along with four others, was published
    on the websites of the Iran newspaper on June 9, and Fars news agency on
    June 10, 2010, quoting the Public Prosecutor of Qom. Arrest and Detention
    Following a complaint filed by a seventeen years old boy claiming that
    three men, threatening him with a knife, had kidnapped, raped, and taken a
    film to silence him, and another similar compliant by an adolescent, the
    Inspector of Branch Three of the Courthouse issued the arrest warrant for
    these three individuals. They were arrested when their hiding place was
    identified two months later. There is no date of arrest in the media
    reports. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. This
    case had been referred to Branch Eight of the Provincial Appeal Court for
    investigation. Charges The charge against the defendant was announced as
    "rape." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against the
    defendant was his confession and statements by plaintiffs. International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of torture to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mehdi, as the
    leader of the gang, to death and the ruling was confirmed by Branch 27 of
    the Supreme Court. The defendant’s request for pardon was rejected at the
    Pardon Commission. He was hanged at the Central Prison in Qom on June 8,
    2010.
