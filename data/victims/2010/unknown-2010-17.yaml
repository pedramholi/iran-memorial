    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with five others,
    was published on the websites of Esfahan Courthouse on January 3 and 10,
    General Office of Esfahan prisons on January 12, and Fars news agency on
    January 9, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Esfahan
    Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant's arrest and detention. According to the Esfahan Public
    Prosecutor, two of defendants stole a vehicle with two passengers, a woman
    and a child, but were arrested after pursuit. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges against these
    defendants were collectively announced as "smuggling narcotics acting as a
    chain." According to the Esfahan Public Prosecutor, members of this gang
    smuggled narcotics, forging various identifications and orders of the
    judicial system, security forces, and Revolutionary Guards, and illegally
    abused uniforms, signs, and licenses of the security forces. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the media
    reports, quoting the Esfahan Public Prosecutor, the evidence presented
    against the defendants was announced as recovery of 500 kilograms of
    opium, 100 kilograms of hashish from a hiding place, over one ton of
    narcotics, war weapons, hand guns, and grenades, forged police
    identifications, and between 60 to 90 kilograms of narcotics from five
    vehicles belonging to this gang. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned the defendant to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor. After
    the defendant s requests for pardon were denied twice, he was hanged in
    the Esfahan Central prison yard on January 9, 2010.
