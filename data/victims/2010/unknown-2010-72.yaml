    News of the execution of an unknown man was published on the website of
    Mazandaran Courthouse on February 24, 2010. Arrest and Detention There is
    no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. According
    to the source, the defendant was arrested in Mazandaran. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial took place
    at the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Sari. Charges The charges against
    this defendant were announced as "transportation and distribution of
    heroin." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against the defendant was announced as "distribution of 6 kilograms of
    heroin." Defence No information is available on the defendant's defence.
    Judgment The court condemned the defendant to death. He was hanged at
    Lajvardi Rehabilitation and Training Center in Sari on February 24, 2010.
