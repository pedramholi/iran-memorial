    News of the execution of Mr. Abbas Garavand, son of Yusefbeik, along with
    five others, was published on the websites of the Kayhan and Iran
    newspapers on May 9, 2010, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Public Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge
    against Mr. Abbas Garavand was announced as "possession of 386 grams of
    heroin." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Abbas Garavand
    to death and he was hanged at the Qezelhesar prison in Karaj on May 8,
    2010.
