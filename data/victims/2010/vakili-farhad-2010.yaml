    The execution of Mr. Farhad Vakili, son of Mohammad Sa'id, former deputy
    head of the office of Agricultural Jihad Organization in Sanandaj, along
    with four others* was announced by the public relations department of
    Tehran's Public and Revolution Courts, and posted on several news
    websites, including ISNA (9 May), Green Movement (10 May and 6 June),
    Committee of Human Rights Reporters (9 May and 6 June), Fars news agency
    (17 May), [and] Center for Iranian Political Prisoners in Exile (7 June),
    of 2010. Information concerning his arrest and case have been extracted
    from Amnesty International (12 January), Organization of Revolutionary
    Workers of Iran [Rahekargar] (26 February) Amir Kabir Newsletter (26
    February), 2010 [and] Human Rights Watch of Kurdistan (30 September) 2007.
    Additional information has been taken from Kurdane Radio (28 May 2010),
    Rojpress (19 October 2011), and the testimony of Sabah Nasri, managing
    editor of 'Rojameh' and a former ward mate of Farhad Vakili, in an
    interview with Iran Human Rights Documentation Center (22 February 2011)
    Mr. Vakili was popular among his fellow- prisoners. Sa'id Razavi-Faqih,
    who was with Mr. Vakili in Andarzgah (Correction Center) 7 of Evin, said:
    he had the fortune of sharing a cell with Vakili. He added, "I had already
    heard a few things about his personality. But we became very close in our
    few days together, developing an emotional bond; I felt that I had made
    one of my best friendships in Evin Prison. Farhad was a very rational,
    reasonable person who managed to keep his emotions in check in the sphere
    of politics. He was a person of moral integrity. Contrary to what many
    might have assumed, his objectives were altruistic rather than personal. I
    remember Farhad's smile. During all our discussions, be they about the
    Iranian society, Kurdistan, political, or social, he always wore a smile.
    I never saw him appearing cold, despondent or bitter. He saw a bright
    future for our society although he believed that we inevitably had to pay
    a price to attain freedom, equality, awareness and a bright future. Farhad
    always told me with a smile that he was not affected by the tortures and
    pressures. He said he he had never let himself become more radical because
    of the tortures and pressures, and that he would not give in to feelings
    of revenge towards his torturers. Nor had he allowed his feelings give way
    to revenge towards his torturers and prison guards. Arrest and detention
    The public relations department of Tehran's Public and Revolution Courts
    announced: "The search squad of Police Precinct 116 of Molavi [street of
    Tehran] grew suspicious of two individuals standing next to a Paykan
    [Iranian-manufactured car], during their patrol on 19 August 2006. On
    spotting the police officers, the two individuals fled the scene. One of
    them, called Peyman, whose real name was later found to be Kaveh, was
    arrested, while the other, named Kamal, escaped. After searching the
    vehicle, the officers found five kilograms of explosives planted under the
    driver's seat. The officers went to the two individuals' residence,
    arresting Farzad Kamangar. According to the same sources, Farhad Vakili
    was arrested on 13 September 2006 after letters rogatory were issued to
    the city of Sanandaj. Regarding circumstances of the arrests of Ali
    Heidarian, Farhad Vakili, and Farzad Kamanger, Human Rights Watch of
    Kurdistan reported, on 20 October 2007, that three Kurdish prisoners
    (Farzad Kamangar, Farhad Vakili, and Ali Heidarian), who had been in
    detention for over 14 months, had been barred from receiving visitors for
    about a month. Mr. Sabah Nasri and Mr. Razavi Faqih talked about Mr.
    Vakili s torture referring to the information he shared with them.
    According to the testimony of Sabah Nasri, another of his ward mates,
    Farhad had a congenital problem in his right leg. So the torturers would
    tie his right leg to a chair and his left leg to a door handle; they would
    then keep opening and closing the door. The action was so tortuous that he
    would almost lose consciousness in the process. According to Mr. Vakili
    himself he spent days, weeks and months of enduring solitary confinement,
    constant pressure of interrogations and lack of news from my family Also
    his other ward mate, Sa'id Razavi-Faqih, told Kurdane Radio said: "Farhad
    told me about the coercions he had endured in Raja'ishahr Prison in Karaj.
    And about how interrogators would put pressure on him to confess to
    involvement in armed operations, whereas he had never taken part in any
    armed operations." In various prisons, Mr. Vakili wrote in a letter sent
    from Evin Prison: "After some two years had passed since my arrest I once
    again had the pleasure of being taken to the secretive Ward 209 of the
    Intelligence Ministry. It brought back memories of my first day in Ward
    209; a time when after enduring the harshest of inhuman acts by the
    Intelligence Department in Sanandaj, I was transferred to Ward 209 to be
    subjected to an even harsher ordeal. I
