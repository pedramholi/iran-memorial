circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ali Heidarian, son of Ahad, born and resident in
    Sanandaj, and four others* was announced by the public relations
    department of Tehran's Public and Revolution Courts, and posted on several
    news websites, including ISNA (9 May), Green Movement (10 May), Committee
    of Human Rights Reporters (6 June), [and] Organization of Revolutionary
    Workers of Iran [Rahekargar] (10 May) 2010. Information concerning Mr.
    Heidarian's arrest and case have been extracted from Amnesty International
    (12 January), Amirkabir Newsletter (26 February) 2011, [and] Human Rights
    Watch of Kurdistan (20 October) 2007. Additional information has been
    taken from the testimony of Sabah Nasri, managing editor of 'Rojameh' and
    a former ward mate of Mr Heidarian, in an interview with Iran Human Rights
    Documentation Center (22 February 2011). Arrest and detention The public
    relations department of Tehran's Public and Revolution Courts announced:
    "The search squad of Police Precinct 116 of Molavi [street of Tehran] grew
    suspicious of two individuals standing next to a Paykan
    [Iranian-manufactured car], during their patrol on 19 August 2006. On
    spotting the police officers, the two individuals fled the scene. One of
    them, called Peyman, whose real name was later found to be Kaveh, was
    arrested, while the other, named Kamal, escaped . The officers went to the
    two individuals' residence, arresting Farzad Kamangar (one of the
    defendants executed at the same time as Mr Heidarian)." Although there was
    no mention of Mr Heidarian's arrest in the announcement by the public
    relations office of the Prosecutor of Tehran's Public and Revolution
    Courts, Mr Heidarian himself mentioned the date of his arrest in the
    following letter sent from Evin Prison, on 1st February 2010: "I was
    arrested by several plainclothes agents on 19 August 2006 and taken to an
    unidentified location." In the letter, Mr Heidarian gives a detailed
    description of his interrogation and torture: "After entering a building
    in an unidentified location, one of the agents angrily heading towards me,
    and suddenly tripping me up. I was handcuffed. He proceeded to kick and
    punch me all over my face and body; he was so engrossed in the act,
    beaming with a mixture of satisfaction, anger and excitement Finally, one
    of his colleagues intervened to stop him. Then a few other plainclothes
    agents from the Intelligence Ministry blindfolded me and put me inside a
    car. ... One of them began the interrogation by asking me, 'Where are you
    from'? I told him I was a Kurd from Sanandaj. I had not finished my
    sentence when he proceeded to punch me. ... He said, 'You are a Sunni. Why
    are you called Ali and your surname is Heidarian?' ... they handed me over
    to another set of agents for [further] interrogation. After entering a
    large room, they sat me in a chair facing an interrogator in an opposite
    chair. Another agent holding an electric shock baton stood next to me.
    They proceeded to interrogate me without reading the charges against me.
    The person next to me continued to apply electric shocks to sensitive
    parts of my body, such as my face, ears and fingertips, while I was being
    interrogated. The purpose was to ensure that I answered the questions
    without a second's delay. Dozens of times I found myself answering
    questions that I had not even fully understood in order to escape further
    electric shocks. They took off all my clothes and laid me down flat on the
    ground. My hands were tied behind my back. Another agent pressed his foot
    on my shoulder, pulling my hands upwards, making it impossible for me to
    make any movement. To intensify the pain, one of them double folded the
    rope, flogging me hard from head to toe. He was clearly very proficient in
    his work since he knew the most sensitive parts of the body as well as a
    doctor... The interrogator constantly bellowed, 'I am the god here and
    your life is in my hands.' It was close to midnight when I was again
    shoved into a car and taken to yet another location. ... Upon entering a
    building, a five-man team proceeded to beat me up without even asking me
    any questions; they merely sought to terrify and intimidate me. One
    grabbed my left and the other my right hand; another two kicked and
    punched me while the fifth kept applying electric shocks. They kept
    repeating, 'This is the end of the line. No-one will leave here alive.'
    ...One of them held an instrument in his hand with which he kept trying to
    pull out my fingernails, causing such agony the intensity of which made my
    earlier pains relatively insignificant. Interrogations took place from
    dawn to dusk every day. At the end of each session I was taken back to my
    cell. Some two weeks had passed since the start of my interrogations when
    as a result of a very heavy punch by one of the interrogators I suffered
    from such a nose bleed that even their doctor could not stop the bleeding.
    I was taken to a clinic outside the detention center, where I found out
    that I had been held in Ward 209 of Evin Pri
