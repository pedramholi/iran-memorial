    News of the execution of Mr. Babak R., along with eight others, was
    published on the website of Iscanews on October 17, 2007. His case was
    related to the murder of a 35-year-old man at Baharestan Street in Tehran
    on January 12, 2002. Arrest and detention Mr. Babak R. was detained for
    six years. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Criminal Court of Tehran tried Mr. Babak R. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Babak R.
    was announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Babak R. was his confession. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense During his
    interrogation, Mr. Babak R. stated that the victim intended to rape him
    and that he had defended himself. No further information is available on
    his defense. Judgment The Criminal Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Babak R.
    to death. Branch 43 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged, along with eight others, in Evin Prison on October 17, 2007.
