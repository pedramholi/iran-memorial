    News of the execution of an unknown man was published on the website of
    the Khorasan newspaper on January 23, 2007, quoting the Public and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor of Shirvan. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial This
    trial took place in Branch 101 of Shirvan Court. No further information is
    available about the defendant s trial. Charges The charge against the
    defendant was announced as "murder." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the
    Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Shirvan, the defendant committed
    murder with a scythe on his farm, during a fight on July 3, 2004. The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant's defense. Judgment The court condemned the
    defendant to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court.
    According to the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Shirvan, efforts
    of the Conciliatory Council to convince the victim s family to pardon the
    defendant were unsuccessful. He was hanged in the presence of the victim s
    family and officials in Shirvan on January 18, 2007.
