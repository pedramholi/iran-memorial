    News of the conviction and the execution of Mr. Abdorrahman Ozbak, a
    national of Afghanistan, along with four others, was published on the
    websites of the Kayhan newspaper on May 30, 2005, and the Jam-e Jam
    newspaper on March 3, 2007. The public prosecutor of Varamin (Tehran
    Province) told the reported of Jam-e Jam : “Unfortunately due to the
    geographical location of Varamin, Afghans easily distribute narcotic drugs
    throughout the city.” Arrest and Detention According to the Public
    Prosecutor of Varamin, “in April of 2004, the activity of a gang of
    foreigners, known as Ozbaks, was detected and the police agents
    infiltrated the gang and arrested 22 smugglers when they were about to
    sell narcotics.” This defendant was one of those arrested. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial, other than it took
    place in Branch 32 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran. Charges
    The charge against the defendant was announced as “smuggling narcotics.”
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided
    against the defendant, along with four others, was collectively announced
    as “recovery of 10 kilograms heroin and 3 kilograms and 500 grams of
    opium.” Defense No information is available on the defense. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Abdorrahman Ozbak to death and the ruling was
    confirmed by the supreme judiciary officials. He was hanged in Varmin
    Prison on March 2, 2007.
