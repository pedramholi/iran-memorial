place_of_death: "Zahedan"
province: "Sistan Va Baluchestan"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Hanging"
circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown person was published on the websites
    of IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on December 2, and the Kayhan
    newspaper on December 3, 2007, quoting the Sistan and Baluchestan
    Judiciary. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The charge against the defendant was announced
    as “carrying 3.5 kilograms of heroin.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on the defense. Judgment The court condemned
    this person to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Judicial
    officials. He was hanged in the Zahedan prison yard on December 2, 2007.
