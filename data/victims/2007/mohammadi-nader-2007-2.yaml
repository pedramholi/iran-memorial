    News of Mr. Nader Mohammadi s execution was published by numerous media,
    including BBC Farsi (October 17, 2007), Kurdistan Media (October 14,
    2007), and the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (October 3, 2007).
    Quoting the Kurdistan Province Judiciary s Office of Public Relations,
    ISNA news agency published news of the execution of two individuals,
    without stating their names (October 17, 2007). Additional information was
    obtained from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation (ABF Interview) with two other individuals accused in the same
    case (Messrs. Layeq Moradi and Karim Zarei). Mr. Nader Mohammadi was
    married and came from the village of Shian, near the city of Sanandaj. He
    had a high school education and laid tiles for a living. According to his
    prison mates, Mr. Mohammadi was a truthful person, and conservative to a
    certain extent. He was kind to all prisoners, regardless of their crimes,
    as people who had been deprived of their freedom. Although he was
    considered a Sunni Moslem, he was not really religious and held secular
    beliefs. Mr. Mohammadi was a supporter of the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan. (ABF Interview). The Human Rights Organization of Kurdistan
    (March 28, 2007) and the Association in Defense of Political Prisoners and
    Human Rights in Iran (October 12, 2007) issued a bulletin objecting to Mr.
    Mohammadi s arbitrary arrest and the violation of his legal and citizens
    rights. The Democratic Party of Iranian Kordestan (PDKI) was founded in
    1945 with the objective to gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in north-west of
    Iran. After the Revolution, conflicts between the new central Shiite
    government and the mainly Sunni Kurdistan, regarding the role of
    minorities in the drafting of the constitution, specification of Shiite as
    the official state religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region,
    ended in armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga
    (the militia of the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1,
    when people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime. On
    August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan and
    declared it unofficial and illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke out
    and continued for several months in the region. By 1983, PDKI had lost
    much of its influence in the region. Various leaders of the PDKI have been
    assassinated. Arrest and Detention According to persons close to him, Mr.
    Mohammadi was arrested in [the city of] Sanandaj by Information Ministry
    agents, in the afternoon of February 18, 2007. He was taken to the
    Information Administration detention center, located behind the Census
    Registration Building. Mr. Mohammadi spent over eight months in solitary
    confinement cells at the Information Administration detention center and
    was under physical and psychological torture. He had no contact or
    visitation with his family. On May 12, 2007, he and the other defendants
    in the case were transferred to the Sanandaj General Prison for three
    days. According to his prison mate of those three days, Mr. Mohammadi s
    right leg, which had been injured during interrogation and torture, was
    bandaged and he was in great pain. (ABF Interview). In an interview with
    the Boroumand Foundation, two of the other defendants in the case stated
    that interrogations were conducted at all hours of the day and night, and
    that they were handcuffed and blindfolded. The interrogators insulted them
    and their religious beliefs, and, through punching, kicking, and beating
    the sole of their feet with electric cables, wanted them to confess at all
    costs that they played a part in the killing of a member of Sanandaj
    Revolutionary Guards Corps. (ABF Interview). Trial On August 1, 2007, the
    Sanandaj Islamic Revolutionary Court Branch Two conducted a closed door
    trial of Mr. Nader Mohammadi and three other defendants in the case.
    According to two of the defendants, Mr. Mhammadi met his court-appointed
    attorney for the first time at trial. The court took less than 25 minutes
    to try the four defendants of the case. In addition to the judge and the
    court secretary, representatives of the Prosecutor s Office and of the
    Information Administration were also present at the trial. The judge
    treated the defendants and their attorneys harshly and with the utmost
    disrespect; he was reading messages on his cell phone while they were
    presenting their defense. (ABF Interview). Charges Mr. Mohammadi and the
    other defendants of the case were charged with Moharebeh ( waging war with
    God ) through acting against national security, affiliation to the defunct
    Democratic Party, carrying out activities on behalf of said Party,
    propaganda against the Islamic Republic, participation in identifying
    people loyal to the holy regime of the Islamic Republic, association and
    conspiracy in performing Party-relegated tasks. (ABF Interview). According
    to the Kurdistan Province Judiciary s Office of Public Relations, Mr.
    Mohammadi was accused of ki
