    News of the execution of Mr. Ali N. was published on the website of the
    Etela’at newspaper on May 31, 2007. Arrest and Detention The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge
    against Mr. N. was announced as “murder.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. According to the Etela’at
    newspaper, the defendant murdered a young man during a fight in 2002.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. N.’s defense. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Ali N. to death. He was hanged in the presence of the
    victim’s family and the judiciary officials of Bandar Anzali.
