    News of the execution of Mr. Sa’id Moradi, along with another person, was
    published on the websites of the Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) and
    the Abrar newspaper on November 14, 2007. According to the reports, “Some
    masked robbers attempted an armed robbery from a goldsmith’s shop in
    Sahneh more than a year ago. In order to disperse people they started
    shooting which resulted in killing of a citizen. They then high-jacked a
    car and escaped the scene.” Arrest and Detention According to the media
    reports, “The security forces of Baneh in Kordestan province suspected a
    Maxima car and stopped it. After searching the car they found weapons and
    anesthesia spray. Finally, the occupants of the car confessed that they
    had previous records for robbery and murder.” Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. The trial took place in the
    Revolutionary Court of Sahneh (Kordestan province). Charges The charges
    against Mr. Sa’id Moradi and the other person who was arrested with him
    were announced as “three counts of murder, public intimidation, and
    several robberies.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided
    against the defendants was “discovery of weapons and Anesthesia spray in
    their car and their own confessions.” Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Moradi’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Sa’id Moradi to
    death in public for being “an enemy of God” and a “corruptor on earth”.
    The ruling was confirmed by Branch 32 of the Supreme Court. He was hanged
    in Imam Khomeini Square in Sahneh on November 13, 2007 at 3 pm.
