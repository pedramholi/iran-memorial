    News of the execution of Mr. Morteza R., along with eight others, was
    published on the website of Iscanews on October 17, 2008. His case was
    related to the murder of an individual at Hashemabad Street in Tehran on
    July 30, 2003. He was only 16 years old when the incident occurred.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention
    on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Morteza R. was detained for four years. The circumstances of
    his arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 74 of the Criminal
    Court of Tehran tried Mr. Morteza R. No information is available on his
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Morteza R. was announced as
    murder. According to the report, he had killed a 27-year-old man for not
    paying the cost of five dresser handles. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Morteza R. Defense Mr. Morteza R. was younger than 18 when the crime was
    committed. No information is available on his defense. Judgment Branch 74
    of the Criminal Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Morteza R. to death. Branch
    40 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along with
    eight others, in Evin Prison on October 17, 2008.
