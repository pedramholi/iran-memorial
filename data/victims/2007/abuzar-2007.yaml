    News of the execution of Mr. Abuzar was published on the websites of the
    Iran newspaper and Fars Province Court House on December 25, and in the
    Ettela at newspaper on December 31, 2007. According to the General and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor of Kazerun, before murdering his wife, he had
    been arrested and imprisoned several times for sedition, drinking, and
    moral corruption. Arrest and Detention According to the reporter of the
    Iran newspaper, at midnight in the beginning of July 2005, Police had to

    criminal investigators later arrested the victims husband, Abuzar. Trial
    The trial took place in the Criminal Court of Fars province, Branch 5.
    Charges The charges against the defendant was announced as, "murder."
    According to the media reports, the defendant murdered his wife by
    shooting her in 2005. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence reported
    against the defendant was his confession and the collected reasons and
    documents in his file . Defense According to the Iran newspaper report, he
    denied murdering his wife during the primary interrogations. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Abuzar to death and the ruling was confirmed by Branch
    37 of the Supreme Court and Branch 15 of the Supreme Court Recognition. He
    was hanged in public at a main square in Kazerun on December 24, 2007.
