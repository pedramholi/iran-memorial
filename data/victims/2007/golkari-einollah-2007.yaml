    News of the execution of Mr. Einollah Golkari, along with two others, was
    published on the websites of Jam-e jam and ISNA (Iranian Students News
    Agency) on April 21, the Iran newspaper on April 22, and the Etela at
    newspaper on April 26, 2007, quoting the Public Relations Office of
    Hormozgan Court House. Arrest and Detention According to the media
    reports, the defendant was arrested when transporting 3 kilograms of
    heroin and 90 kilograms of opium from Bandar Abbas to Mahshahr. Trial This
    trial took place in Branch Three of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Bandar Abbas. No further information is available on the defendant s
    trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Einollah Golkari was announced as
    "smuggling narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense According to the
    Deputy of the Public Prosecutor in Bandar Abbas, the pardon request by the
    defendant was rejected by the Pardon Commission. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Einollah Golkari to death and confiscation of his
    properties. After the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was
    hanged in public on April 21, 2007. Mr. Einollah Golkari was 55 years old.
