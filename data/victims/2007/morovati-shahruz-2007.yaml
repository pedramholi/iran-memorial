    The execution of Mr. Shahruz Morovati was announced on the websites of
    ISNA (September 12), the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper (October 4), and the
    Police Information Base (October 6), 2007. The Jomhuri Eslami newspaper
    quotes the Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor saying: “The judicial
    system in cooperation with the security forces will stand firm before
    hooligans.” According to the same source, he was a member of “Adidas”
    organized-crime ring. Mr. Shahab Darvishi, another alleged member of this
    ring, was executed in 2006. Arrest and Detention According to ISNA, “After
    a series of intelligence operations, the defendant was arrested by the
    Intelligence Ministry forces in Kermanshah on September 10, 2007.” Trial
    No information is available on the defendant’s trial other than he was
    tried at Branch Two of the Public Court of Sahneh (Kermanshah province).
    Charges The charges against Mr. Shahruz Morovati were announced as
    “sodomy, establishment of a corruption ring, consumption of alcohol, and
    sedition” (Police Information Base). The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. According to the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper,
    the defendant, who was arrested in 1999, escaped twice from the prison.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Morovati’s defense. Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Shahruz Morovati to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public in the Imam Square in Sahneh
    on October 2, 2007. According to the Police Information Base, “During the
    execution police established full security and the ruling was carried out
    without any security issues.”
