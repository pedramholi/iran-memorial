    News of the execution of Mr. Mansur (Safdar) Eskandari, along with another
    person, was published on the websites of ISNA (Iranian Students News
    Agency) on June 13, the Iran newspaper on June 14, and the E’temad and
    Jame Jam newspapers on June 13, 14, 2007. Arrest and Detention According
    to the Iran newspaper report, on September 14, 2005, the police agents of
    the Fighting against Narcotics Office in Tehran were informed of a major
    shipment of opium from Sistan and Bluchestan province to Tehran by a
    smuggling network. On September 15, the smugglers’ vehicle was identified
    in Biyabanak near Karaj and five individuals including the defendant were
    arrested after an armed clash. Trial This trial took place in Branch One
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Karaj. Charges The charges against
    Mr. Mansur Eskandari, were announced as “transportation, possession, and
    distribution of opium.” According to the Chief Judge of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Karaj, “the defendant had a record of previous
    conviction for transportation and distribution of narcotics.” The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the media
    reports, the defendant confessed to distribution of one ton of narcotics
    in Tehran. When the hiding place and the vehicle of the defendant were
    searched, 355 kilograms of impure opium, 346 kilograms of pure opium, 7
    Kalashnikov weapons, and some bullets were recovered. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the
    case of political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised.
    The National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners
    plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their
    political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations
    have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those
    prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available on the
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mansur Eskandari to death, as a
    “corruptor on earth” and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court.
    His pardon request was rejected by the Pardon Commission. He was hanged in
    public in Hesarak, Karaj, on June 13, 2007. During an interview with the
    E’temad newspaper he said, “I have two small daughters. I demanded the
    judge not to execute me for the sake of my daughters... I was the victim
    of the drug lords.” With a picture of his daughter in hand, he went to the
    gallows and put the rope around his neck by his own hands.
