    News of the execution of a person called A. was published on the website
    of the Velayat newspaper on September 22, 2007. Arrest and Detention
    According to the report, police officers arrested the perpetrators of a
    collective fight, after a murder was committed during this fight, and
    transferred them to the Intelligence Office. Trial The trial took place in
    the Criminal Court of Qazvin. No further information is available on the
    details of the trial. Charges The charge against the defendant was
    announced as "murder." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown . Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against the defendant was announced as, his confession, witnesses
    testimonies, a forensics report, and complaints of the victim s family.
    Defense In explaining the incident, the defendant stated that he was at
    home when his brother went in fearfully and said that he had been attacked
    and beaten by some people. He went outside to support his brother and
    injured the victim with a knife. Judgment The court condemned the
    defendant to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He
    was hanged at the Qazvin Central Prison on September 19, 2007 at dawn.
