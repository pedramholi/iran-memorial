    News of the execution of Mr. Jabbar M., along with another individual,
    both of whom were citizens of Afghanistan, was published on the website of
    the Fars news agency on July 23, 2007 quoting the Social and Advisory
    Assistant of the Security Headquarters of the Central Province. Arrest and
    Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. According to the Fars news agency report, the defendants were
    arrested by the security forces of Delijan (Sistan and Baluchestan
    province) in 2006. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Jabbar M. were announced as
    "carrying and importing heroin." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. M.’s defense. Judgment The circumstances of this
    defendant’s execution are not known. According to the above source, Mr.
    Jabbar M. was hanged in the Delijan prison yard after due process.
