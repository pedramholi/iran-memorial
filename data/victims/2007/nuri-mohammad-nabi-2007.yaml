    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Nabi Nuri, known as Hossein
    Abdollahzadeh, a citizen of Afghanistan and resident of Zabol (Sistan and
    Baluchestan Province), was published on the websites of ISNA (Iranian
    Students News Agency) and the Police Information Base on February 26,
    2007. Arrest and Detention According to the Police Information Base
    report, the defendant was arrested by the officers of the Shahid
    Taqipur-Dihuvak check-point in Tabas (Yazd Province) on January 7, 2005.
    According to ISNA, he was arrested on January 8, 2005. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charge
    against the defendant was announced as carrying 9 kilograms and 800 grams
    of heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The judiciary officials condemned Mr. Mohammad Nabi Nuri to death
    and confiscation of his possessions and the vehicle containing the
    narcotics. He was hanged in Tabas Prison on February 25, 2007 at dawn.
