circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an individual identified as H. was published on
    the website of the Resalat newspaper on March 13, 2007, quoting the Public
    Relations Office of Khorasan Razavi Court House. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention.

    as "transportation and possession of 7 kilograms and 900 grams of heroin
    (crystal)." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense According to this report, his/her
    request for pardon was rejected by the Pardon Commission of Khorasan

    Judgment The court condemned Mr./Ms. H. to death, the ruling was confirmed
    by the Supreme Court and carried out at the prison office location in
    Torbate Heidarieh.
