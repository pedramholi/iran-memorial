    News of the execution of Ms. Zahra N. (Shirin), a 40 year old
    hair-dresser, was published on the websites of the E’temad newspaper on
    September 18, 2007, the Iran newspaper on February 23, 2006 and December
    10, 2007, ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on December 18, 2007, and
    ISCA News on December 19, 2007. According to Iran , “the defendant’s three
    young daughters, who initially wanted her to be punished during her trial,
    tried to stop her execution two years after the ruling was issued. They
    asked the Judiciary to stop the execution and asked their grandparents to
    forgive their mother.* They went to the branch of the Criminal Court of
    Tehran responsible for carrying out court rulings to request conciliatory
    sessions in order to appeal to their grandparents’ compassion and ask them
    to let their mother stay alive.” Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial The trial took
    place in Branch 71 of the Criminal Court of Tehran Province. Charges Ms.
    Zahra N. was charged with “murder.” According to the reports, she murdered
    her husband with cyanide on May 7, 2005 because “she had a relationship
    with another man.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided
    against the defendant were her confession and the confession of her
    collaborator. He stated: “She told me that she wanted to commit suicide in
    order to avoid her angry husband. But on the night of the incident, she
    called and asked me to go to her house. I realized that she poured the
    poison in her husband’s drink and made him drink it. Nevertheless, we took
    her husband to the hospital but he died a few minutes later” ( Iran ).
    Defense In her defense in the court, Ms. N denied her previous confession.
    She claimed that she was deceived by a young man who gave her poison to
    pour into her husband’s food and she did not know the poison was deadly.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. In the case of political detainees, these confessions are,
    at times, televised. The National Television broadcasts confessions during
    which prisoners plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and
    renounce their political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights
    organizations have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by
    those prisoners who are freed. Judgment The court condemned Ms. Zahra N.
    to death and the ruling was confirmed by Branch 33 of the Supreme Court.
    She was hanged in Evin prison on December 19, 2007. * In the Iranian Penal
    Code, murder is punishable by execution (retribution), giving the family
    of the victim the right to consent to the execution sentence or forgive
    the perpetrator.
