    News of the execution of Mr. Shahbaz Qanbarzehi, along with five others,
    was published on the websites of Fars news agency on May 7, ISNA (Iranian
    Students News Agency) and Kerna on May 8, 2007, quoting the Public and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor of Kerman. According to the Public and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor of Kerman, Mr. Qanbarzehi was a member of a
    smuggling gang in the northern elevations of Kerman who transported
    narcotics from Afghanistan and distributed within the province. Arrest and
    Detention In September 2006, anti narcotics security forces in Nasr Base
    were informed about the activities of this gang and a while after,
    identified and arrested them. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Shahbaz Qanbarzehi was
    announced as "smuggling narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt According to the media reports, the evidence provided against Mr.
    Qanbarzehi was their confession and recovery of 130 kilograms of
    narcotics, several weapons, ammunition, and several cameras at their base
    on the northern elevation of Kerman. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Qanbarzehi s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ahmad
    Qanbarzehi to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He
    was hanged in public in Chatrud, Kerman, on May 8, 2007.
