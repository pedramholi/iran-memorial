    News of the conviction and execution of Mr. Ahmad Qanbarzehi, along with
    five others, was published on the websites of Fars news agency on May 7,
    ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) and Kerna on May 8, 2007, quoting the
    Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Kerman. According to the Public and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor of Kerman, Mr. Qanbarzehi was a member of a
    smuggling gang in the northern heights of Kerman who transported narcotics
    from Afghanistan and distributed within the province. Arrest and Detention
    In September 2006, anti narcotics security forces in Nasr Base were
    informed about the activities of this gang and a while after, identified
    and arrested them. Trial No information is available on the defendant s
    trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Ahmad Qanbarzehi was announced as
    "smuggling narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    According to the media reports, the evidence provided against Mr.
    Qanbarzehi was their confession and recovery of 130 kilograms of
    narcotics, several weapons, ammunition, and several cameras at their base
    on the northern elevation of Kerman. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense No information is available on Mr. Qanbarzehi s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ahmad Qanbarzehi to death and the ruling
    was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was hanged in public in Chatrud,
    Kerman, on May 8, 2007.
