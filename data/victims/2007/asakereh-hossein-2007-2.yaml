    Mr. Asakereh was married and had two children. He resided in the town of
    Sarbandar, near [the city of] Mahshar, in the south of Khuzestan Province
    and had a college education. News of Mr. Hossein Asakereh s execution was
    published by numerous sources, including: Amnesty International (February
    7, 2008), the Ahvaz Human Rights Organization (January 30, 2008), and the
    Ahvaz Democratic Popular Front (January 3, 2008). Additional information
    was obtained from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation with two individuals accused in the Ahvaz bombings case,
    including a prison mate, as well as other sources,*and an electronic form
    sent to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation by a peson close to him.
    According to the existing information, Mr. Asakereh, son of Alavan, was
    born in Mahshahr in 1971. He was married with two children, a boy and a
    girl. He resided in the town of Sarbandar, near the city of Mahshar, in
    the south of Khuzestan Province and had an Associate Degree in Industrial
    Electricity. He worked as an indurstrial electrician in the Special Zone
    of Tehran Jonoob Company. According to the electronic form, Mr. Asakereh
    was an intelligent and a humanist, who lived a simple life and helped
    others as much as he could. Mr. Asakereh along with Abdolhossein Horaibi
    and Ahmad Moramazi, was in the sixth group of Khuzestan Province ethnic
    Arabs who were executed in Ahvaz, in connection with the 2005 bombings and
    unrest. The sentence and execution issued for this group of individuals
    prompted numerous reactions from The U.N. human rights institutions, the
    European Parliament, Amnesty International (October 18, and December 7,
    2007), and the Ahwaz Human Rights Organisation (November 5, 2007, and
    January 2, 2008). In a resolution issued on December 19, 2006, the UN
    General Assembly expressed grave concern about widespread human rights
    abuses, the use of torture and execution in Iran, and, more particularly,
    regarding discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities. The open
    publication by seven of the Ahvaz bombing defendants attorneys resulted in
    their prosecution on the charge of endangering national security in Ahvaz.
    (ILNA, October 7, 2006). The attorneys trial was supported by the UN
    Special Rapporteurs objections. (UN website, January 10, 2007). On January
    22, 2008, the European Parliament strongly condemned the execution of four
    Arab political activists, including Mr. Asakereh. Historical Background of
    the Ahvaz Bombing Subsequent to the publication of a letter ascribed to a
    government official concerning systematic modification of the fabric of
    Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab population, demonstrations broke out on
    Friday, April 15, 2005, in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in [the town of]
    Hamidideh. In quashing the demonstrations, security and police forces
    resorted to violence, which led to the death and injury of dozens of
    protestors and resulted in the protests and the unrest spreading to a
    number of other Khuzestan cities, continuing for at least 10 days.**These
    protests were the beginning of a series of incidents, including widespread
    arrests, multiple bombings, and successive executions in Ahvaz. For
    instance, a series of bombings followed on June 12 and October 15, 2005,
    and on January 24 and February 27, 2006, in various regions of Ahvaz,
    Abadan, and Dezful. These bombings were carried out in front of government
    buildings and in public places and left in their wake more than 20 dead
    and dozens injured.***According to government sources, other bombings
    (targeting oil pipelines and non-residential regions around Ahvaz)
    occurred at the end of summer and in the fall of 2005, which did not leave
    any casualties. In response to the Ahvaz bombings, security forces
    arrested dozens of the region s ethnic Arab individuals, charging them
    with participation in the bombings. They were then kept in solitary
    confinement cells, for months, at the Information Ministry s Detention
    Center. People being held were subjected to torture, in order to confess
    having taken part in the bombings. According to the Ahvaz Prosecutor,
    ultimately a total of four cases were opened at the Revolutionary Court,
    Special Branch, and at least 45 individuals were charged. Dozens of these
    individuals were tried in closed sessions and were sentenced to death by
    the Revolutionary Court. At least 20 of these sentences were carried out.
    Dozens of other Arab citizens were given long-term sentences. Government
    officials never accepted that these bombings had internal reasons which
    had arisen following the Khuzestan incidents. In multiple, and sometimes
    contradictory, statements, political and judicial authorities imputed
    responsibility to groups opposing [the Islamic Republic], including, Those
    loyal to the previous regime and residing in England; Fugitive SAVAK (the
    Shah s security and intelligence apparatus) members, and family members of
    the destroyed Monafeqin (MKO); Wahabis; secessionists; and/or to groups
    affiliated
