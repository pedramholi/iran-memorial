    Mr. Reisan Savari was a middle school teacher, an Ahvazi Arab activist,
    and a member of the Vefaq Party. News of Mr. Reisan Savari s execution was
    published by numerous sources, including the Amnesty International
    (February 15, 2007), Human Rights Watch (February 15, 2007) and Radio
    Farda (February 15, 2007). Quoting the Office of Public Relations of
    Khuzestan Province s Judiciary, Fars News Agency published the news of the
    execution of three unidentified individuals in Ahvaz (February 14, 2007).
    The head of the Organization for the Defense of Prisoners Rights stated
    that the number of those executed was four (Radio Farda, February 14,
    2007). Additional information was obtained from an interview conducted by
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with two individuals accused in the
    Ahvaz bombings case [Boroumand Foundation interview], including one of his
    prison mates, and one from other sources.* Mr. Reisan Savari was 32 years
    old, single, and a resident of Ahvaz. He was a middle school teacher, an
    Ahvazi Arab activist, and a member of the Vefaq Party.** (Ahwaz Human
    Rights Organization). According to one of his prison mates, he had
    extensive social relations, was a fairly religious person (prayed
    regularly), had a sense of humor, and was well liked by other prisoners.
    He was among the first prisoners to severely object to breaches of his and
    other prisoners rights. According to Amnesty International, Mr. Savari had
    been arrested in the Ahvazi Arabs protest of March-April 2005, and
    released shortly thereafter. Mr.Savari, along with Qasem Salamt and Majed
    Albughbish , made up the fourth group of Khuzestani Arabs who were
    executed in connection with 2005-2006 unrests and bombings. The issuance
    of a death sentence for this group of defendants caused strong reactions
    from the attorneys in the case, from the Organization for the Defense of
    Prisoners Rights, and from international organizations such as Amnesty
    International (November 13 and December 24, 2006); Human Rights Watch
    (November 11, 2006);. By issuing a resolution on December 19, 2006, the
    U.N. General Assembly had expressed its grave concern regarding the
    widespread breach of human rights as well as the use of torture and
    execution, especially discrimination against ethnic and religious
    minorities, in Iran. The publication of seven of the defense attorneys
    objections resulted in the latter being summoned by Branch 7 of the Ahvaz
    Prosecutor s Office, for endangering national security. The defense
    attorneys trial was followed by the U.N. Special Rapporteurs objections.
    (U.N. website, November 11, 2006). Historical Background of the Ahvaz
    Bombing Subsequent to the publication of a letter ascribed to a government
    official concerning systematic modification of the fabric of Khuzestan
    Province s ethnic Arab population, demonstrations broke out on Friday,
    April 15, 2005, in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in [the town of]
    Hamidideh. In quashing the demonstrations, security and police forces
    resorted to violence, which led to the death and injury of dozens of
    protestors and resulted in the protests and the unrest spreading to a
    number of other Khuzestan cities, continuing for at least 10 days.***
    These protests were the beginning of a series of incidents, including
    widespread arrests, multiple bombings, and successive executions in Ahvaz.
    For instance, a series of bombings followed on June 12 and October 15,
    2005, and on January 24 and February 27, 2006, in various regions of
    Ahvaz, Abadan, and Dezful. These bombings were carried out in front of
    government buildings and in public places and left in their wake more than
    20 dead and dozens injured.**** According to government sources, other
    bombings (targeting oil pipelines and non-residential regions around
    Ahvaz) occurred at the end of summer and in the fall of 2005, which did
    not leave any casualties. In response to the Ahvaz bombings, security
    forces arrested dozens of the region s ethnic Arab individuals, charging
    them with participation in the bombings. They were then kept in solitary
    confinement cells, for months, at the Information Ministry s Detention
    Center. People being held were subjected to torture, in order to confess
    having taken part in the bombings. According to the Ahvaz Prosecutor,
    ultimately a total of four cases were opened at the Revolutionary Court,
    Special Branch, and at least 45 individuals were charged. Dozens of these
    individuals were tried in closed sessions and were sentenced to death by
    the Revolutionary Court. At least 19 of these sentences were carried out.
    Dozens of other Arab citizens were given long-term sentences. Government
    officials never accepted that these bombings had internal reasons which
    had arisen following the Khuzestan incidents. In multiple, and sometimes
    contradictory, statements, political and judicial authorities imputed
    responsibility to groups opposing [the Islamic Republic], including, Those
    loyal to the previous regime and residing in England; Fugitive SAVAK (t
