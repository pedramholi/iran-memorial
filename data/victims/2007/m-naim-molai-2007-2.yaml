    News of the execution of Mr. Na im Mola i was published on the websites of
    Isca news on July 18, ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on July 21, and
    the Kayhan newspaper on July 22, 2007, quoting the Assistant Judge of the
    Public and Revolutionary Court in Zabol. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on Mr. Mola i s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Mola i s trial. This trial took place in
    Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Zabol. Charges The charge
    against Mr. Mola i was announced as "transportation and possession of 10
    kilograms of heroin." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Mola i. Defense No information is
    available on the Mr. Mola i's defense. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the Mr. Mola i s execution. The court condemned Mr. Na im
    Mola i to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Judicial
    authorities. He was hanged in public at Shahrbani intersection in Zabol on
    July 18, 2007.
