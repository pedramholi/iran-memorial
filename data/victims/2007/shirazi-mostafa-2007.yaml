    News of the execution of Mr. Mostafa Shirazi was published on the website
    of Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) on June 25, 2007 and on the
    websites of the Keyhan and Asre Iran newspapers on July 1, 2007. Arrest
    and Detention The media reports quoted the Public and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor of Khomeini Shahr (Esfahan province) saying that a gang of
    fifteen individuals who robbed houses, and in one occasion kidnapped and
    raped a teenage girl, were arrested by the police. Mr. Mostafa Shirazi was
    identified as the leader of this gang. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant’s trial. The trial took place in Branch Two of the
    Criminal Court in Khomeini Shahr. Charges The charges against Mr. Mostafa
    Shirazi were announced as “rape, robbery, extortion, and kidnapping.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the Public and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor of Khomeini Shahr, the evidence provided against the defendant
    was his “confession,” and “complaints of 48 plaintiffs.” Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Shirazi’s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Mostafa Shirazi to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged in the presence of officials and the public in Namaz
    Square of Manzarieh in Khomeini Shahr on July 1, 2007.
