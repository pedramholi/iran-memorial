    News of the execution of Mr. Ali, was published on the website of the
    Tehran Emruz newspaper on April 26, 2007. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on Mr. Ali s arrest and detention. Trial This trial
    took place at the Revolutionary Court of Tehran. No further information is
    available about Mr. Ali s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Ali were
    announced as "transportation of 480 kilograms of morphine and 2,330
    kilograms of opium." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Ali. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ali's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ali to
    death and the ruling was carried out at the Evin prison on April 25, 2007.
