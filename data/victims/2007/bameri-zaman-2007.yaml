    News of the execution of Mr. Zaman Bameri was published on the websites of
    ISCA News on May 1, and the Kayhan newspaper on May 2, 2007. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial
    other than it took place in Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Khash (Sistan and Baluchestan Province). Charges The charge against Mr.
    Bameri was announced as “carrying and possession of 6 kilograms of
    heroin.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Bameri to death and the ruling was
    confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was hanged in Zahedan prison on May 1,
    2007.
