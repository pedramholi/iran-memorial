place_of_death: "Taybad"
province: "Khorasan-e Razavi"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr./ Ms. B. A., an Afghan citizen, along with two
    others, was published on the website of the Khorasan newspaper on October
    9, 2007, quoting the Public Relations Office of Khorasan Razavi Court
    House. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant s arrest and detention. Trial This trial took place at the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Mashhad. No further information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charge against the
    defendant was announced as "importing 4 kilograms of crystal." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendants. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr./ Ms. B. A. to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was executed
    in the Tayebad prison on October 8, 2007.
