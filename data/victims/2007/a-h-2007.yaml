province: "Khorasan-e Razavi"

circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. / Ms. H. A., along with two others, was
    published on the website of the Khorasan newspaper on October 9, 2007,
    quoting the Public Relations Office of Khorasan Razavi Court House. Arrest
    and Detention There is no specific information on Mr. / Ms. H. A. s arrest
    and detention. Trial This trial took place at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Mashhad. No further information is available on Mr. / Ms. H. A. s
    trial. Charges The charge against Mr. / Ms. H. A. was announced as
    "importing 6 kilograms of crystal." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against the defendants. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. / Ms. H. A.'s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. / Ms. H. A. to death and the ruling was confirmed by the
    Supreme Court. He was executed in the Tayebad prison on October 8, 2007.
