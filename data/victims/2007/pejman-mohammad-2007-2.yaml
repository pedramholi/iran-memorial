    News of the conviction and execution of Mr. Mohammad Pejman was published
    on the websites of the Peigham weekly magazine on September 16, 17, 2006,
    May 27, 28, 29, 2007, and IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on May 29,
    2007. Arrest and Detention According to Peigham , following a complaint
    made by a female student in Bushehr in July of 2006, who claimed to be
    kidnapped by three youths in the forest near Chahkuh and later raped by
    seven youths, police went to the area and arrested all defendants except
    one, who had become a fugitive. Trial This trial took place in the
    Punitive Court of Bushehr province. Charges The charge against Mr. Pejman
    was announced as rape. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided
    against the defendant was his confession. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense No information is available on the defense. According to
    Peigham , the families of the defendants gathered in front of Bushehr
    Court House after the ruling were issued. In this gathering, which was
    tense due to the emotional reactions of the mothers and sisters of the
    defendants, the families objected to the process and demanded to stop the
    rulings being carried out. They also gathered in front of the Highway
    Patrol of Bushehr and shut the road for a while. The mother of one
    defendant who was very upset told the reporter that her son and most of
    the other defendants were under 18 and claimed that the kidnapping charge
    was baseless since the girl went with the defendants voluntarily. She also
    objected to the public attorney s role and the rulings. The families
    believed that they were going to lose their children because they were
    unable to defend them properly. They also distributed the pardon text of
    the victim s family among the people, judiciary officials, and the media.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and
    the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to
    avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the age of
    eighteen. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad Pejman to death and
    the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. According to the media
    reports, the execution of this defendant, along with five others in this
    case, was postponed three times when the defendants families objected.
    During the second investigation, the Appeals Court and the Head of the
    Judiciary finally confirmed the rulings. According to Peigham , due to the
    gatherings by the defendants families in front of the Court House and the
    Government Building, the Provincial Security Council decided to carry out
    the executions separately and in a different time frame. Mr. Mohammad
    Pejman was hanged in Borj prison in Bushehr on May 29, 2007.
