circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Abdolhaq Askani, along with another person,
    was published on the websites of the Fars news agency on May 22 and the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on May 24, 2007 quoting the Public Relations
    Office of the Sistan and Baluchestan Provincial Court. Arrest and
    Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Abdolhaq Askani were announced as
    "participation in several armed robberies and roadblocks." The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. The Fars news agency report
    indicated "proved guilty", but there is no reference to how or based on
    what evidence the defendant had been proved guilty. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Askani's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Abdolhaq Askani to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He
    was hanged in public in Saravan on May 21, 2007.
