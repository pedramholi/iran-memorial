    News of the execution of Mr. Sa id Qanbarzehi, 17 years old, was published
    on the websites of ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) and Entekhab on May
    28, Mihan blog and Taftan on May 29 2007, and Baluchestan People Party on
    March 16, 2007. International laws have strictly prohibited capital
    punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Qanbarzehi
    s arrest and detention are not known. According to Mihan blog, Mr.
    Qanbarzehi, along with some others, was arrested after a bombing in March
    2006. According to this source, he and his companions were tortured
    severely including breaking of toes and fingernails, burning by a hot
    iron, and muscle tearing by a drill. Trial This trial took place in the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Zahedan. No further information is
    available on the Mr. Qanbarzehi s trial. Charges The charges against Mr.
    Sa id Qanbarzehi were announced as, Moharebeh (fighting), Mofsed
    (corruptor on Earth) for armed uprising, membership and sympathizing with
    a terrorist group, terror and bombing including the martyrdom of four
    police officers at Bozorgmehr and Mo lem intersection in Zahedan and
    killing the martyr Falahati, a car driver. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence provided against Mr. Qanbarzehi s was his confession . According
    to the website of the Baluchestan People Party, the official television of
    the Islamic Republic in the Baluchestan province broadcast pictures of
    seven individuals including Mr. Sa id Qanbarzehi as those who confessed to
    being fighters for justice and national and human rights of the Bluch
    people. International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned
    the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. In the case of political detainees, these confessions are,
    at times, televised. The National Television broadcasts confessions during
    which prisoners plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and
    renounce their political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights
    organizations have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by
    those prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available about
    the Mr. Qanbarzehi s trial. s defence. According to the report of the
    Baluchestan People Party, Sa id Qanbarzehi was arrested only because of
    his relationship with a Baluch fighter and he was forced to confess by
    severe torture. In a letter to the website of Taftan, a person who
    introduced himself as Mr. Sa id Qanbarzehi s cousin, stated: we are from
    Qanbarzehi s tribe and more than a thousand of us have been killed and
    there is no family without a killed or executed member. Sa id was only 17.
    There were children who stepped on mines. Sa id s uncle was shot [by
    officials] a while ago. My two brothers were executed. Fifty persons were
    executed from my grandfather s family since the beginning of the
    revolution, all with trumped-up charges of narcotics. We are glad that Sa
    id was not charged for narcotics and was executed for cooperation with
    Jondollah. The Popular Resistance Movement of Iran, known as Jondollah,
    was established in 2003. This group declared its goal as a struggle for
    achieving the religious and national rights of Baluch and Sunni people in
    Systan and Baluchestan provinces in Iran and emphasized that it is not a
    separatist group. In 2005, this group began a series of military operation
    against the Islamic Republic forces during which tens of the regime s
    forces were captured or killed. In response, the Islamic Republic arrested
    and executed tens of members of this group, and military operations
    continue in Systan and Baluchestan. In an interview with the media outside
    of Iran, the leader of this group, Abdolmalek Rigi, rejected the
    government s labels of terrorist and foreign agent and claimed that they
    began their struggle against the Islamic Republic to replace it with a
    popular regime that recognizes the rights of all humans. The news of his
    arrest was published by the Intelligence Ministry of Iran on February 23,
    2010. The circumstance of his arrest is yet unknown. A Summary of the
