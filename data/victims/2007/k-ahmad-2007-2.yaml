    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad K. was published on the websites of
    IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on November 26, and Esfahan Central
    Court House and the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on November 27, 2007. Mr.
    Ahmad K., 37 years old, was a resident of Rahnan in Esfahan. He was
    married and had four children. He was working as a furniture painter.
    Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on Mr. Ahmad K. s
    arrest and detention. Trial Branch six of the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Esfahan tried Mr. Ahmad K. There is no further information regarding
    his trial sessions. Charges The charges against the defendant were
    reported as "purchasing and transporting 88 kilograms of opium." According
    to IRNA, the defendant had been condemned to eight years imprisonment and
    paying a 26 million Tuman fine for possession and transportation of 50
    kilograms of opium in 2001. He had been then pardoned after three years.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendants. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ahmad K. to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by the Chief Public Prosecutor. He was
    hanged at the Central prison of Esfahan on November 26, 2007.
