    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Zohrehvand was published on the
    website of the Khorasan newspaper on May 19, 2007. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on the Mr. Zohrehvand s arrest and
    detention. Trial This trial took place at Branch One of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court in Torbat-e-Heidariyeh. No further information is
    available about Mr. Zohrehvand s trial. Charges The charges against Mr.
    Mohammad Zohrehvand were announced as "transportation and possession of 15
    kilograms of heroin." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Zohrehvand. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Mohammad Zohrehvand to death and the Chief Public Prosecutor confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged in the presence of the judge in the
    Torbat-e-Heidariyeh prison yard in May of 2007. The exact date of this
    execution is unknown. Mr. Mohammad Zohrehvand was 26 years old.
