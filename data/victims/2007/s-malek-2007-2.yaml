    News of the execution of Mr. Malek S., along with three others who were
    executed in two days, was published on the websites of Fars news agency
    and the Tose’eh newspaper on June 16, 2007. He was from Rudan in the
    eastern part of Hormozgan province. Arrest and Detention The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. According to the
    media reports, agents arrested him in his house. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. The trial took place in the
    Revolutionary Court of Rudan. Charges The charge against Mr. Malek S. was
    announced as “dealing one kilogram and 18 grams of heroin.” The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the media
    reports, “He tried unsuccessfully to hide the heroin when agents entered
    his house.” The report of this execution does not contain any information
    regarding the evidence of selling heroin by the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Malek’s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned this defendant to death and confiscation of his possessions. The
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and the Pardon Commission voted against
    his pardon. Mr. Malek S. was hanged in Bandar Abbas prison. The exact date
    of his execution is not mentioned in the media reports.
