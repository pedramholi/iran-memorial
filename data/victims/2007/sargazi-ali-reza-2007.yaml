    News of the execution of Mr. Alireza Sargazi was published on the website
    of ISNA(Iranian Students News Agency) on May 16, 2007. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges The charge against Mr. Alireza Sargazi was announced as
    "possession of 6 kilograms and 800 grams of heroin." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defence No information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Alireza Sargazi to death and he was hanged in
    public at the Zahedi Square in Baravat, Bam, on May 16, 2007.
