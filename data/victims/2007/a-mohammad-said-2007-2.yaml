circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Sa’id A. was published on the
    websites of the Khabar-e Jonub newspaper on December 22, and the Fars
    Provincial Court on December 25, 2007, quoting the Public Relations Office
    of the Fars Provincial Court. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial This trial took
    place in Branch One of Sepidan Court (Fars Province). Charges Mr. A. was
    charged with “murder and burning the victim’s body.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence provided against the defendant was his “confession”.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. In the case of political detainees, these confessions are,
    at times, televised. The National Television broadcasts confessions during
    which prisoners plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and
    renounce their political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights
    organizations have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by
    those prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available on the
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad Sa’id A. to death and
    the ruling was confirmed by Branch 27 of the Supreme Court, Branch 15 of
    the Supreme Court Recognition, and the Head of the Judiciary. He was
    hanged in public in Sepidan on December 20, 2007.
