    News of the arrest and execution of Mr. Mohammad (Mahmud) A., along with
    two others, was published on the websites of IRNA (Islamic Republic News
    Agency) on April 19, 2006, October 15 and 16, 2007, ISNA (Iranian Students
    News Agency) and Farsnama on October 15, and the Khabare Jonub newspaper
    on October 16, 2007. According to the Head of the Criminal Sentence
    Implementation Bureau andthe Criminal Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor
    s Office of Shiraz, Mr. Mohammad (Mahmud) A., was a member of a gang,
    called Amir Siah, who had raped their victims. (Khabare Jonub newspaper)
    According to the media reports, Mr. Mohammad (Mahmud) A., and three
    others, (members of the Amir Siah gang) blocked the road on a taxi,
    transporting two young women, with their vehicle and forced the women to
    ride on their vehicle threatening with weapon. They took them to a garden
    near Shiraz and three of the men raped the young women. After the rape,
    one of the gang members began shooting his gun in the air in order to
    intimidate the kidnapped women and convince them not to make a complaint.
    Arrest and Detention Mr. Mohammad (Mahmud) A., was arrested on December 1,
    2005 following a complaint made by two women about being kidnapped and
    raped by four men on November 29, 2005, two days earlier. (Khabare Jonub
    newspaper) Trial The trial took place in Branch Five of the Criminal Court
    of Fars. No further information is available about Mr. Mohammad A. s
    trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Mohammad (Mahmud) A., was announced
    as "rape." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Mohammad (Mahmud) A. was the complaint by two women about being raped.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohammad (Mahmud) A. 's
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad (Mahmud) A. to death
    and the ruling was confirmed by Branch 32 of the Supreme Court. The
    defendant s request for pardon was rejected in the Pardon Commission of
    the Judiciary. He was hanged in public at Mo alem Square of Shiraz on
    October 15, 2007. During an interview following this execution, the
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of Shiraz asked women to wear their cover
    (Hejab) appropriately to avoid harassment by seditious individuals.
