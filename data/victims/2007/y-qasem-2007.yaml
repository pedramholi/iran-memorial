    The execution of Mr. Qasem Y., known as “Tarantula” and also “Day Bat of
    Tehran”, was announced on the websites of ISCA News (December 19) and the
    Jame Jam newspaper (December 20) 2007. Background information regarding
    the trial and the verdict is taken from the websites of Fars News Agency
    and ISNA (February 14), the Iran newspaper (November 5), ISNA (December
    18) and the Farhang-e Ashti (February 15) 2007. His age was said to be 28
    in some reports (ISCA News and Iran ) and 35 in other reports (Fars and
    ISNA news agencies, and Farhang-e Ashti ). Arrest and Detention According
    to ISCA News, following several complaints of molestation by parents of
    several male students about the kidnapping of their sons by a person who
    claimed to be an officer, a special tracking operation was ordered by the
    police to identify the “Day Bat”. The suspect was identified, surrounded,
    and arrested by officers of Section Five of the Central Intelligence
    Office. He was detained in solitary confinement and held incommunicado.
    Trial According to the media, the case against the defendant was examined
    in Branch 71 of the Criminal Court of Tehran Province on February 14,
    2007. At the beginning of this session, 13 of the 15 present plaintiffs
    testified the act of rape performed by the defendant. They described how
    the defendant posed as an officer, chose his victims in various ways, beat
    them, sometimes threatening them with a knife, forced them to ride on his
    motorcycle, blindfolded them (with bandage), and took them to a
    construction site in order to sodomize them. Charges The charges against
    Mr. Qasem Y. were announced as "kidnapping 15 boys, between the ages of 12
    and 17, pretending to be an officer, and committing acts incompatible with
    religion." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to several reports, the
    evidence provided against the defendant was announced as his
    “confessions,” testimony of the plaintiffs who identified him, some forged
    documents, a stolen motorcycle, an [official] stamp, and two small daggers
    in the defendant’s house. One of the witnesses was the defendant’s
    neighbor. The Fars News Agency quoted his testimony: “One night in August
    of 2006 around 11 p.m., I noticed a man’s voice coming from Qasem’s
    construction site asking for help. I notified the Police 110. Since the
    door was locked the officers used flashlights but saw nothing and left.
    About 7 minutes later, a 16 year old boy came out of the building and ran
    away. Two minutes later, Qasem came out and claimed that the boy had been
    a burglar.” Defense In his defense, the defendant stated: “I am 35 years
    old. I worked at a soup factory and in a company as a revenue collector”
    (Far News Agency). He continued: “from the age of 12, I distributed
    newspaper in addition to school. [I lived honorably] and I am also an
    athlete” ( Farhang-e Ashti ). He claimed that he had been arrested by
    mistake due to similarity in physical appearance [to the real perpetrator]
    (ISNA, February 14, and Farhang-e Ashti ). In response to the judge’s
    question, “You confessed to rape during the interrogation. How do you
    explain that?”, he replied that he did not confess to anything (Fars News
    Agency). He added: “One of the officers tied [me] to a tree with little
    clothes and asked [me] to confess as he wanted.” (ISNA, February 14). The
    judge asked about plaintiffs and their clear identification of the
    defendant. The latter said: “One of the officers told them to identify me
    as the perpetrator” and stated: “I have not committed the crime and have
    been arrested by mistake. ISCA news reported “he considered himself
    innocent [and] claimed not to know anyone among plaintiffs.” To the
    judge’s question whether he was in a fist fight with one of the
    plaintiffs, he gave a negative response and said: “The officers beat me in
    front of plaintiffs in order to convince them” (Fars News Agency). It is
    not clear what, he claimed, the officers wanted to convince the plaintiffs
    of. The defendant explained the statement made by his neighbor by saying:
    “Because I was doing construction in their neighborhood, the neighbor had
    animosity against me and his claim was a lie. Every day at 5:30 pm, after
    the workers leave the building, I would lock the door and leave the
    building” (Fars News Agency). About the discovery of an official stamp in
    his house, the defendant said: “I used the
