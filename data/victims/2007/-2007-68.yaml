    News of the execution of an unknown person was published on the websites
    of the Hamvatan Salam newspaper on October 31, and Kayhan on November 3,
    2007. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges This defendant was charged with “murder.”
    According to the media reports, quoting the Public Prosecutor of Kohnuj,
    “the defendant murdered his fiancé’s brother, with a kitchen knife, during
    a family dispute in 2003.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The court condemned the defendant to death and he was hanged in
    the central square of Kohnuj (Karman Province) on October 31, 2007.
