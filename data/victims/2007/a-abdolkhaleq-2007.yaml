    News of the execution of Mr. Abdolkhaleq A. was published on the websites
    of the Police Information Base on May 29 and the Jamejam newspaper on May
    30, 2007. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant s arrest and detention. Trial The trial took place at the Public
    and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office of Saravan. No further information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges against Mr.
    Abdolkhaleq A. were announced as "several armed robberies and blocking
    traffic with arms". The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the media
    reports, the evidence presented against the defendant was his confession
    to robberies. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of torture to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on the defendant's defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Abdolkhaleq A. to death and he was hanged in public at 22
    Bahman Square in Saravan on May 28, 2007. This report did not mention any
    confirmation of the ruling by the Supreme Court.
