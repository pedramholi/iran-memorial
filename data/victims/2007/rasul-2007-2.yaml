    News of the execution of Mr. Rasul was published on the websites of the
    Iran and Isca News newspapers on January 3, 2007.Additional information is
    taken from the Hambastegi newspaper (December 16, 2006), Khabar-e Jonub
    (June 9, 2006), and Iran and Sharq newspapers (May 15, 2006).Mr. Rasul was
    45 years old and one of the respected and trustworthy people of his
    neighborhood. Arrest and Detention Mr. Rasul was arrested following a
    complaint filed by a woman and her husband claiming that the woman was
    threatened and harassed by Mr. Rasul. Different news sources have
    mentioned the date of the woman s complaint as either the Spring or
    October of 2004. Trial Branch 77 of Criminal Court of Tehran Province
    tried Mr. Rasul on July 15, 2004. There is no further information
    available on his trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Rasul were
    announced as "rape and adultery . He was accused of threatening a woman to
    have a sexual affair. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The
    evidence presented against the defendant was his confession, and the
    statements by plaintiff.According to the plaintiff stated Mr. Rasul was
    harassing the woman through phone calls threatening him to divorce her
    husband and marry Mr. Rasul. The woman, eventually, decided to talk to Mr.
    Rasul in person and asked him to go to the woman s aunt s house which was
    vacant at the time. She thought she could convince him to give up but
    while they were talking, Mr. Rasul raped her one day, when Mr. Rasul knew
    the woman s husband was away on a mission, forced her into a car and took
    her to the north of Iran for a week. She then decided to file a complaint
    against him upon returning to Tehran. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rasul s defense.
    Judgment Branch 77 of the criminal court of Tehran Province condemned Mr.
    Rasul to death on February 01, 2005 (Hambastegi) and the ruling was
    confirmed by Branch 33 of the Supreme Court. He was hanged in the Evin
    prison on January 3, 2007.
