    News of the execution of Mr. Shamsoddin Darvakh Gorgij, along with another
    person, was published on the website of IRNA (Islamic Republic News
    Agency) on November 24, 2007, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Sistan and Baluchestan Judiciary. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charges
    against the defendant were announced as “carrying and possession of
    heroin.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on his defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Shamsoddin Darvakh Gorgij to death and
    the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Judicial officials. He was hanged
    in the Zahedan prison yard on November 24, 2007.
