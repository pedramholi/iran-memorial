    Information about Mr. Ali Chaldavi was obtained from various sources
    including Ahvaz Human Rights Organization (December 30, 2007), Ahvaz News
    Agency (January 2, 2008), and the Iranian Human Rights Activists Groups in
    EU and North America s report (January 21, 2008). Additional information
    concerning Arab citizens protests in Khuzestan Province has been obtained
    through an interview conducted by the ABF with a number of eyewitnesses to
    the protests; a report from Milan Kothari, the UN Special Rapporteur on
    the Right to Adequate Housing (March 21, 2006); from bulletins and reports
    by Amnesty International (April 20, 2005 and May 17, 2006); and Human
    Rights Watch (May 20, 2005 and February15, 2007); and from numerous
    reports by the Ahvaz Human Rights Organization, the Ahvaz News Agency; the
    ISNA and IRNA news agencies; as well as from news websites, including BBC
    and Gooya News. Mr. Ali Chaldavi was a young man of 23, single, and worked
    at a grocery store in Ahvaz. A Summary of the Khuzestan Protests
    Subsequent to the publication of a letter dated July 24, 1998, ascribed to
    then-President Khatami s Chief of Staff, Mohammad Ali Abtahi,
    demonstrations protesting the letter broke out on Friday, April 15, 2005,
    first in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in other cities, such as Mahshahr
    and Hamidideh, and continued for several days. The letter emphasized the
    modification of Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab population through
    promotion and encouragement of the migration of non-native populations to
    the province, [thus] reducing Khuzestan s Arab population to one third of
    the total population of the province. Although the government s
    spokesperson officially denied [the existence of] this letter on Saturday,
    April 16, the demonstrations that had been called for by the Coordination
    Committee for Popular Protests in Ahvaz continued extensively in the
    coming days. In calling for demonstrations, [the organizers] highlighted
    various factors, including the central government s policies in
    expropriating Arab farmers lands for various projects such as sugar cane
    development, and marginalization of, as well as profound discontent among,
    Khuzestan s Arab [population], as a result of the regime s efforts to
    obliterate Arab identity. The demonstrations that had started in
    Shelangabad (Da ereh), one of [the city of] Ahvaz s poor neighborhoods,
    quickly spread to the center of Ahvaz and to the cities of Mahshahr and
    Hamidieh. Citing Ahvaz News (a regional news organization) and
    eyewitnesses at the scene, the Ahvaz Human Rights Organization s bulletin,
    dated April 15, 2005, stated, Around three thousand Arab people of Ahvaz
    have gathered together and started extensive but peaceful demonstrations
    in Kordovani Street and Square, along with thousands of others in
    neighborhoods such as Shelangabad, Malashieh, Ameri, and Kut Abdollah,
    among others. Security forces are attacking the demonstrators, first with
    tear gas, and are subsequently firing on them in Da ereh and Malashieh
    neighborhoods. The degree of violence resorted to by security and police
    forces in quashing the demonstrations was such that it led to the death of
    a number of protestors. Dozens more were injured. Subsequent to these
    deaths, the intensity and magnitude of the protests increased. In a number
    of towns, demonstrators proceeded to cut off roads and to occupy
    government buildings and police posts. These protests continued for ten
    days in many Arab regions of Khuzestan. Protestors demanded a government
    apology to the region s Arabs. Official government sources, quoting the
    Islamic Republic s Defense Minister, announced the death toll as standing
    at three or four. (ISNA, April 19, 2005) Civil society activists, however,
    declared the number of people killed during these events to be between 50
    and 60. Amnesty International stated the number as 29; Human Rights Watch
    , 50; and the Ahvaz Human Rights Organization , 160. Dozens of others were
    injured. The Ahvaz General and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office announced
    the arrest and arraignment of 447 individuals. (IRNA, April 25, 2005)
    Local sources, however, announced the number as being greater than 1200. A
    number of intellectuals and ethnic leaders were among those arrested.
    Although the demonstrations subsided after ten days, widespread arrests,
    multiple bombings, successive executions, and popular protests continued
    on various occasions, including the anniversary of the events. Related
    Protests in the Following Years In the years since the violent incidents
    of April 15, 2005, the regime s forces have continued to violently
    suppress the peaceful protests of the Arab citizens of Khuzestan Province,
    whenever they occur, including on the anniversary of the protests. Every
    year, as April 15th nears, a wave of arrests takes over the entire region.
    Internet access is cut off, and other means of communication, such as
    telephones, are tapped and strictly controlled by the security apparatus.
