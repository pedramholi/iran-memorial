    News of the conviction and execution of Mr. Abdolreza, along with two
    others, was published on the websites of the E temad newspaper on January
    4, the Sharq newspaper on January 3, 2006, the Hamshahri newspaper on
    August 1, 2005, the Javan newspaper on August 1 and July 31, 2005, the
    Meidan Zanan newspaper on October 29, 2006, and Iscanews on June 11 and
    13, 2007. Arrest and Detention On March 24, 2004, residents of an
    apartment complex in Malard, Karaj, reported the murder of a person in his
    house. The police questioned the victim s wife. She claimed that four
    masked men murdered her husband. After questioning the neighbors, they
    denied seeing any unknown people except a young man who visited the victim
    s apartment occasionally. The police suspected the victim s wife. During
    the technical interrogations, she confessed to murdering her husband with
    the help of a young man named Abdolreza. Then the police arrested the
    defendant in Karaj on March 30, 2004. Trial According to the Hamshahri
    newspaper, the defendant s trial took place in Branch 71 of the Criminal
    Court of Tehran Province in two sessions. Charges The charge against Mr.
    Abdolreza was announced as "murder." According to the media reports, the
    defendant and the victim s wife had a secret relationship and murdered him
    in collusion with each other. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided
    against the defendant was announced as his confessions, the confession of
    the victim s wife, the statement by victim s 10-year-old daughter
    regarding her mother s secret relationship with the defendant, and the
    forensic report. Defense According to the media reports, after being
    arrested, the defendant said that he surrendered to his temptation and had
    nothing to say on his defense. During the court session, the defendant and
    his assistant accepted the murder charge but claimed that they had no
    intention to kill the victim and that his death was an accident. Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Abdolreza to death and the ruling was confirmed by
    Branch 36 of the Supreme Court. He was hanged in the Evin prison on June
    13, 2007.
