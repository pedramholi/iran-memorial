    News of the execution of Mr. Esma il Barani Piranvand was published on the
    websites of ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) and the Young Journalists
    Club on October 31, 2007, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Sistan and Baluchestan Provincial Court. According to the media reports,
    he was previously condemned to five years imprisonment for carrying forty
    kilograms of opium. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information
    on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant s trial. This trial took place in the Revolutionary Court
    of Iranshahr (Sistan and Baluchestan Province). Charges The charge against
    Mr. Barani Piranvand was announced as carrying and possession of 2.45
    kilograms of heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Esma il Barani
    Piranvand to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Judiciary
    officials. He was hanged in the central prison of Iranshahr on October 31,
    2007.
