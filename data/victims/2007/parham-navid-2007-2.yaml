    News of the arrest and the execution of Mr. Navid Parham was published on
    the websites of the Sharq newspaper on September 30, 2004, IRNA (Islamic
    Republic News Agency) and the Khabare Jonub newspaper on July 9, 2007, and
    the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper and Police Information Base on July 10, 2007.
    Arrest and Detention According to the Sharq newspaper, quoting the Chief
    of Police in Shiraz, after a worker in a pizza place was killed in 2004
    and a witness stated that he saw people in a motorcycle escape, the police
    investigation resulted, two months later, in the arrest of eight members
    of a gang. Trial This trial took place in Branch 122 of Shiraz Court.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Navid Parham were announced as “murder and
    robbery.” According to the Public Relations Office of the Fars Court, he
    had a record of previous convictions. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence
    provided against the defendant were “his confessions to several cases of
    extortion in various parts of town” and the statement by the gang leader.
    According to the Chief of Police in Shiraz, after members of the gang were
    arrested, the leader confessed that they intended to rob a passerby and
    since he resisted, the Mr. Parhamn struck him with a dagger in the chest
    and they escaped on a motorcycle.” International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense No information is available on Mr. Parham’s defense at the
    court. However, the police chief of Shiraz stated: “as the detectives
    reenacted the scene, they came to the conclusion that this was not a
    pre-meditated murder, and it appears to be related to robbery…” Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Navid Parham to death and the ruling was confirmed
    by Branch 28 of the Supreme Court. He was hanged in public in the Kazerun
    Gate in Shiraz on July 9, 2007.
