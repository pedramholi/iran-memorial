    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Tork, along with two others,
    was published on the website of Khabare Jonub and in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspapers on November 18, 2007. Additional information was taken from the
    website of the Student Committee of Human Rights Reporters on November 14
    and 18, 2007, ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on November 14, 2007,
    Fars news agency on July 20, 2006, and the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    February 22, 2006. His case and the cases of three others were related to
    the murder of three shepherds at the Zamanabad village near Malayer on
    November 5, 2005. He was 16 years old at the time of the incident.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention
    on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Tork was arrested and transferred to the Hamadan Prison on
    November 9, 2005 (Student Committee of Human Rights Reporters). After a
    victim s relative filed a complaint, the inspectors of Malayer and Hamadan
    police investigated and arrested nine members of a tribe. After one of the
    arrested individuals confessed, three others were arrested. Mr. Tork was
    detained at the Correction and Rehabilitation Center in Hamadan for two
    years. He was transferred to the Hamadan Public Prison in August of 2007.
    Trial The Criminal Court of Hamadan tried Mr. Tork and the other
    defendants. The first session began on February 20, 2006 (Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper). No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge
    against Mr. Tork was announced as murdering three children. According to
    the existing information, he and his uncle (or grandfather in some
    reports) and his two other relatives murdered three young shepherds by
    blows of a knife over tribal disputes at gardens near the Zamanabad
    Village. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence
    presented against Mr. Tork was his confession during interrogation and
    trial, testimonies of locals, the forensics report, and the complaint by
    the victims parents. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of torture to obtain confessions from detainees and
    have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress.
    Defense Mr. Tork was younger than 18 when the incident occurred. According
    to reports, his uncle (or grandfather) provoked the murders. His attorney
    was able to make the last defense in court. However, no information is
    available on his defense. Judgment The Criminal Court of Hamadan condemned
    Mr. Mohammad Reza Tork to death. The ruling was confirmed by Branch 16 of
    the Supreme Court and the Head of Judiciary on June 19, 2006. He was
    hanged, along with two other defendants of this case, at the Hamadan
    Prison yard on November 15, 2007. The fourth defendant of this case was
    condemned to five years imprisonment for assisting in murders.
