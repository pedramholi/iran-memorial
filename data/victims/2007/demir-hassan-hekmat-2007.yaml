    A Summary of the Defects of Mr. Hassan Hekmat Demir s Legal Proceedings No
    precise information is available about the proceedings in Mr. Hassan
    Hekmat Demir s case. Most media outlets reported that he was a member of
    Pejak. Since Pejak is engaged in armed action, he was most probably tried

    against the regime is punishable by death. Based on human rights
    organizations reports, Mr. Hassan Hekmat Demir was in dire need of medical

    Guidelines, the responsibility to treat prisoners falls on the shoulders
    of the relevant authorities. Furthermore, some organizations report that
    Mr. Hekmat Demir was denied access to an attorney. Pursuant to the Law on
    the Rules of Criminal Procedure for General and Revolutionary Courts, Note
    1 to Article 186, in force at the time of his trial, If in crimes for

    present at these trials, the judge may not proceed. If he does proceed
    with the adjudication, the ruling that is issued has no legal value or
