    News of the execution of Mr. Habibollah Taher Moradi, along with another
    person, was published on the website of the Human Rights Organization of
    Kurdistan (Ensaniat) on April 21, 2007. Arrest and Detention According to
    the above source, Mr. Taher Moradi was arrested in 2005. There is no
    specific information on Mr. Taher Moradi s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Taher Moradi s trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Taher Moradi were announced as "distribution and selling
    narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    the Taher Moradi 's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Habibollah
    Taher Moradi to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court.
    He was hanged in the Sanandaj Central prison on April 21, 2007.
