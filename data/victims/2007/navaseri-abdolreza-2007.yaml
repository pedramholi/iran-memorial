    One of the wonders of the Iranian Judiciary is that it can accuse a person
    of carrying out bombings while he s in prison,That lays bare the
    arbitrariness of his conviction. Human Rights Watch News of Mr. Abdolreza
    Navaseri s execution was published in numerous sources, including Amnesty
    International (September 13, 2007), Ahvaz Human Rights Organization
    (September 14, 2007), and Radio Farda (September 13, 2007). Quoting the
    Ahvaz prosecutor, the IRNA and ISNA news agencies published news of the
    execution of three individuals (September 13, 2007), without mention of
    their names. Additional information regarding this case was obtained from
    an interview by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with two individuals
    accused in the case, which has been referred to as the Ahvaz bombings case
    by Iranian authorities, including a prison mate ( ABF Interview ) and from
    other sources.* Additional information regarding this case was obtained
    from an interview by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with two other
    individuals accused in the Ahvaz unrests, including a prison mate ( ABF
    Interview ) and from other sources.* Mr. Navaseri was thirty-five years
    old, single, and was from Ahvaz. According to one of his friends and
    prison mates, he was dignified, polite, and disciplined. He conducted
    Koran and Arabic calligraphy classes in prison and was considered popular
    at Karun Prison. Mr. Navaseri believed in armed struggle against the
    Islamic Republic for the rights of ethnic Arabs but considered it s use
    permissible only against military and economic targets. He was against the
    killing of civilians. He was a member of a group that had bombed certain
    military centers and oil pipelines in the Ahvaz region in the late 1990 s.
    (ABF Interview). In 2000, Mr. Navaseri was arrested and subsequently
    sentenced to 35 years imprisonment for the bombing of Ahvaz Daghagheleh
    oil pipeline and for the attack against the Badr Force headquarters.
    (Radio Farda, September 13, 2007). He had been serving his sentence at
    [the city of] Tabas Prison. He was Mehdi Navaseri s elder brother, who had
    been executed on March 2, 2006, for the bombing of Naderi Street in Ahvaz
    . Mr. Navaseri, along with Mohammad Ali Savari and Ja far Savari were the
    fifth group of Khuzestan Province ethnic Arabs who were executed in Ahvaz,
    in connection with the 2005 bombings and unrest. The sentence and
    execution issued for this group of individuals prompted numerous reactions
    from the attorneys in the case, the Association for the Protection of
    Prisoners Rights, as well as international organizations such as Amnesty
    International (May 17 and June 29, 2006) and Human Rights Watch (June 26
    and November 11, 2006). In a resolution issued on December 19, 2006, the
    UN General Assembly expressed grave concern about widespread human rights
    abuses, the use of torture and execution in Iran, and, more particularly,
    regarding discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities. The open
    publication of seven of the Ahvaz bombing defendants attorneys resulted in
    their prosecution on the charge of endangering national security in Ahvaz.
    (ILNA, October 7, 2006). The attorneys trial was supported by the UN
    Special Rapporteurs objections. (UN website, January 10, 2007). Historical
    Background of the Ahvaz Bombing Subsequent to the publication of a letter
    ascribed to a government official concerning systematic modification of
    the fabric of Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab population, demonstrations
    broke out on Friday, April 15, 2005, in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in
    [the town of] Hamidideh. In quashing the demonstrations, security and
    police forces resorted to violence, which led to the death and injury of
    dozens of protestors and resulted in the protests and the unrest spreading
    to a number of other Khuzestan cities, continuing for at least 10
    days.**These protests were the beginning of a series of incidents,
    including widespread arrests, multiple bombings, and successive executions
    in Ahvaz. For instance, a series of bombings followed on June 12 and
    October 15, 2005, and on January 24 and February 27, 2006, in various
    regions of Ahvaz, Abadan, and Dezful. These bombings were carried out in
    front of government buildings and in public places and left in their wake
    more than 20 dead and dozens injured.***According to government sources,
    other bombings (targeting oil pipelines and non-residential regions around
    Ahvaz) occurred at the end of summer and in the fall of 2005, which did
    not leave any casualties. In response to the Ahvaz bombings, security
    forces arrested dozens of the region s ethnic Arab individuals, charging
    them with participation in the bombings. They were then kept in solitary
    confinement cells, for months, at the Information Ministry s Detention
    Center. People being held were subjected to torture, in order to confess
    having taken part in the bombings. According to the Ahvaz Prosecutor,
    ultimately a total of four cases were opened at the Revolutionary Court,
