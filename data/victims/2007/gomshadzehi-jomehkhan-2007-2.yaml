    News of the arrest and execution of Mr. Jom ehkhan Gomshadzehi, a resident
    of Saravan (Sistan and Baluchestan province), was published on the
    websites of the Entekhab newspaper on August 4, 2007, and IRNA (Islamic
    Republic News Agency), ISCA News, and Fars News Agency on October 30,
    2007. Arrest and Detention According to the Entekhab newspaper, quoting
    the Head of Police, Department to Fight against Narcotics, the defendant
    escaped from Saravan to Afghanistan and Pakistan and ultimately chose
    Dubai for his activities. In July 2007, he was arrested, along with
    another person, in Tehran when attempting to deal drugs. According to the
    same source, the defendant was not armed when arrested. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. According to ISCA News,
    considering the significance of this arrest, the police department wrote a
    letter to the Head of the Judiciary and demanded a special judicial
    process for this case. Charges According to the Head of Police, Department
    Specialized to Fight against Narcotics, the charges against Mr. Jom ehkhan
    Gomshadzehi were announced as capturing and killing nine police officers,
    importing 50 tons of narcotics annually, and exporting part of that to the
    Persian Gulf countries and Turkey. According to the same source, the
    defendant combated the police when carrying narcotics in 2003 which
    resulted in killing of an officer and his escape to Dubai. He was leading
    the drug trafficking operation from Pakistan to Iran through his agents.
    He imported narcotics into the country from Afghanistan and Pakistan with
    the help of a group consisting of his brothers and nephews, using tankers.
    The location of their storage of narcotics was in Kuhsefid, Saravan. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the Head of
    Police, Department to Fight against Narcotics, police recovered a total of
    10 tons of opium and 400 kilograms of morphine from the defendant during
    previous years. Also, according to the same source, the defendant
    confessed to smuggling 400 kilograms of morphine and heroin to European
    countries during the past several years. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense No information is available on the defense. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Jom ehkhan Gomshadzehi to death and the ruling was
    confirmed by the Supreme Judicial officials. He was hanged in the Zahedan
    prison yard on October 30, 2007.
