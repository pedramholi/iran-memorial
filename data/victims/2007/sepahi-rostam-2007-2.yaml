    News of the execution of Mr. Rostam Sepahi was published on the websites
    of IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) and ISNA (Iranian Students News
    Agency) on November 15, 2007, quoting the Public and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor’s Office of Zahedan. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charges against Mr.
    Sepahi were announced as “carrying and importing of 274 kilograms of opium
    and carrying and possession of two weapons with ammunition.” The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Rostam Sepahi to death and the ruling was
    confirmed by the Supreme Judiciary. He was hanged in the Zahedan prison
    yard on November 15, 2007.
