circumstances: >
    According to the website of Khabare-Jonub on June 14, 2007, one unknown
    individual, along with five other unknown individuals, were executed. The
    Tehrane-Emruz website reported that five unknown individuals were executed
    on the same date. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on
    the defendant s arrests and detention. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant s trial. Charges This defendant and two other defendants
    were charged with "murder." The charge against the other three defendants
    was announced as having "transported 360 grams of heroin." The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant s defence. Judgment No specific information is available
    about the defendant s execution. This defendant along with five other
    defendants were hanged in the Evin Prison on June 13, 2007.
