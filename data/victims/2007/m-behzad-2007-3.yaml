    News of the execution of Mr. Behzad M. was published on the websites of E
    temad Melli on May 16, Farhang-e Ashti on May 17, and Hamvatan Salam
    newspapers on May 15, 2007. Mr. Behzad M. was 28, married, and worked as a
    driver for a lawyer named Hushang. Arrest and Detention According to
    Farhang-e Ashti newspaper, Mr. Hushang s wife went to the police in Tehran
    in February 2004 and reported that her husband, who had left home with his
    car to visit a friend two days earlier, was missing. Police began a search
    and a few days they found Mr. Hushang s car at Sadeqieh Square with no
    trace of him. Detectives suspected Mr. Behzad M. and inspected his house.
    They noticed a stench from a closet and found the body of the lawyer when
    they opened it. Subsequently, the police arrested Mr. Behzad M. Trial This
    trial took place in Branch 71 of the Punitive Court of Tehran. No further
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charge
    against Mr. Behzad M. was announced as "murder." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    According to the media reports, the evidence presented against the
    defendant was his confession and the body found in his closet. Defense In
    his defense and explaining the motivation for murder, the defendant says:
    I provided a single s home for Hushang [the victim] and sometimes supplied
    alcoholic beverages when he had a party. On the day of the murder, in an
    unusual state of mind, he proposed that I offer him my wife for a good sum
    of money. When I heard this, I became angry and killed him. Then I stole a
    one-million-Toman check from his office and hid his body in the closet.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Behzad M. to death and the ruling was
    confirmed by Branch 27 of the Supreme Court. He was hanged in the Evin
    prison yard on May 16, 2007.
