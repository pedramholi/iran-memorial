    News of the execution of an unknown man was published on the websites of
    the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper and ISCA News on March 1, 2007 and the
    Khabar-e Jonub newspaper on April 5, 2007. Arrest and Detention According
    to the Khabare Jonub newspaper, a young man went to the Ardebil Police
    department and complained about a stench in his yard. Police investigated
    and discovered the body of a thirteen year old boy buried in the yard. He
    had been dead for 35 days. The body was transferred to the Coroner s
    Office and an autopsy showed that the boy was suffocated. After
    investigation and interrogation, the same young man was charged as the
    prime suspect of this case. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges The charge against the defendant was announced
    as murder. According to the Khabare Jonub newspaper, the defendant
    kidnapped, molested, and murdered a boy who was on his way to school. He
    wanted to bury the body in the wilderness around Ardebil; however, he was
    unable to find a suitable place and buried the body in his own yard. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided against the defendant
    were his confession , a taxi paper found in the burial place, the fact
    that he worked in a taxi service, and a recovered lost shoe of the victim
    when recreating the crime scene. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on the defense. Judgment The court condemned
    this defendant to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court.
    He was hanged in public in Ardebil on March 1, 2007.
