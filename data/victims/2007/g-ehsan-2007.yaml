    The execution of Mr. Ehsan G. was announced on the websites of the Islamic
    Republic Police Information Base on December 16, and the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on December 19, 2007. Arrest and Detention According to the
    Police Information Base, quoting the Chief of Police in Lorestan province,
    “the defendant, in cooperation with two of his friends, kidnapped a person
    in Kuhdasht in 2003. Police identified them and arrested his
    collaborators, but he was able to escape. Four years later, police
    arrested and took him to the judiciary officials.” Trial No information is
    available on the trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Ehsan G. were
    announced as “shooting at people’s houses, assault and battery, robbery,
    acts incompatible with chastity, destruction of public transportation,
    creating public insecurity, and deprival of public peace” (Police
    Information Base). Based on the report of Jomhuri Eslami , here “acts
    incompatible with chastity” refers to “sodomy.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    According to the Chief of Police in Lorestan, “The defendant possessed two
    side arms, a Kalashnikov and a grenade, when he was arrested.” According
    to the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, “the defendant had a previous criminal
    record including shooting, hooliganism, and sodomy.” Defense No
    information is available on his defense. Judgment The court called Mr.
    Ehsan G. “at war with God” and a “corruptor on earth” and condemned him to
    death. The court did not clarify which charge resulted in the capital
    punishment. He was hanged in public in Keshavarzi Square in Kuhdasht
    (Lorestan province) on December 15, 2007. In the report of this ruling, it
    is not clear whether or not the case was referred to and confirmed by the
    Supreme Court.
