    News of the execution of Mr. A. R., along with another person, was
    published on the website of ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on October
    29, 2007, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Judiciary of the
    Central Province (Markazi). Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. According to ISNA,
    the defendant was arrested by Arak police. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial other than it took place in the
    Revolutionary Court of Arak. Charges The charges against the defendant
    were announced as “carrying, possession, and distribution of 18 kilograms
    of morphine and 100 grams of burned opium, and also addiction to opium.”
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. A. R. to death and the ruling was
    confirmed by the Public Prosecution Office. He was hanged in Arak Prison
    yard on October 25, 2007 at dawn.
