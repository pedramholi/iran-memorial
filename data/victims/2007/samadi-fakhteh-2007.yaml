    News of the conviction and execution of Ms. Fakhteh Samadi, along with
    eight others, was published on the websites of the Hamvatan Salam
    newspaper on August 10, 2005, theHamshahri and Iran newspapers on August
    11, 2005, Fars News Agency and ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on
    October 20, 2007, Iscanews on October 17, and the E temad Melli newspaper
    on October 8, 20 26, 2007. Arrest and Detention There are two different
    versions of the defendant s arrest in the media. According to the E temad
    Melli newspaper, the defendant was arrested, along with her fianc , under
    the Seyedkhandan Bridge on January 6, 2002. But, according to the Hamvatan
    Salam newspaper, after the police recovered the victim s body, they found
    out that a woman named Fakhteh, who had been working in the victim s house
    for two months, was missing. The police then suspected this woman and
    began a search for her. They were able to find her phone number and
    contacted her. They told her that she suspected of a robbery and when she
    went to the police station, they arrested her. Trial This trial took place
    at either Branch 1157 of the General Penal Court of Tehran or Branch 1602
    of Tehran Criminal Complex. No further information is available about the
    defendant s trial. Charges The charge against Ms. Fakhteh was announced as
    "murder." According to the media reports, she murdered her boss in his
    house on December 27, 2001. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided
    against the defendant was her confessions . Defence The E temad
    Mellinewspaper quoted an attorney saying, The lawyer of Fakhteh Samadi
    stated that several legal problems existed in the verdict. If proven, the
    case could be dismissed. For example, the lawyer's claim of insanity
    needed the forensic commission's involvement. Besides, the legal processes
    for those who condemned to death were missing. According to the same
    newspaper, the defendant had an unsuitable mental state and the doctor
    prescribed her some medications that could influence her behavior if not
    taken. According to the defendant s statement, the victim imprisoned her
    in his house, hid her medication, and kept the phone away from her until
    she gave in to having a relationship with him. Fakhteh s doctor said,
    Fakhteh took a life, but, if we look at the circumstances correctly, her
    punishment based on the Islamic Punitive Law, is both unfair and unjust.
    According to Iscanews, in her defence, the defendant stated, The old man
    intended to harm me devilishly. Believe me, I just committed the crime to
    defend myself. Judgment The court condemned Ms. Fakhteh Samadi to death
    and the ruling was confirmed by Branch 15 of the Supreme Court. She was
    hanged in the Evin prison on October 17, 2007. The defendant s lawyer
    stated that he had received an order to stop the execution three hours
    before it was carried out. But, according to the judge the Execution Unit
    of the Public Prosecution Office of Tehran, no such order was received by
    that branch.
