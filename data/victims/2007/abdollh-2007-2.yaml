    News of the execution of Mr. Abdollah was published on the websites of the
    Hambastegi newspaper on December 5 and the Qods newspaper on December 8,
    2007. Arrest and Detention According to theQodsnewspaper, based on the
    marks on the victim s neck, officials suspected that the murderer might be
    a person known to the victim. Therefore, when they noticed contradictions
    in the statements by the victim s brother-in-law, they arrested him. Trial
    According to the Hambasteginewspaper, this trial took place in Branch 71
    of the Punitive Court of Tehran Province on August 28, but according to
    theQodsnewspaper, it took place in Branch Ten of Public Court in Qazvin.
    No further information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Abdollah was announced as "murder." According to
    reports, he murdered his pregnant sister-in-law on April 4, 2005, claiming
    that she was corrupted. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against the defendant was his confession and the statement of the victim s
    husband saying his wife was alive when he left home and his brother had
    been at their house since 8 in the morning of the day that his wife
    disappeared. Additionally, during the police investigation, neighbors and
    the victim s family members denied the defendant s claim of corruption and
    confirmed the victim s chastity. Defence The defendant primarily denied
    committing any crime, but later he accepted the charge and said, I killed
    my sister-in-law because she was corrupt. I did not see anything myself
    but the shopkeepers talked about it. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Abdollah to death with the condition of paying half of Dieh (blood money)
    by the victim s family for her murder and to paying Dieh and 5 years
    imprisonment for killing an eight-month-old fetus. The ruling was
    confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was hanged in the Central Qazvin prison
    on December 6, 2007.
