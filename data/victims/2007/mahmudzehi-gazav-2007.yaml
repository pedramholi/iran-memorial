    News of the execution of Mr. Gazav Mahmudzehi, along with three others,
    was published on the websites of IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency), ISNA
    (Iranian Students News Agency) on September 4 and 5, 2007, Fars News
    Agency on September 5, and the Khabare-Jonub newspaper on September 6,
    2007. Arrest and Detention According to the Khabare-Jonub newspaper,
    police were able to arrest four leaders of a narcotics gang in Sa
    adatshahr. According to the Deputy Public Prosecutor of Shiraz, these
    individuals were arrested during an armed clash with the agents in Noruz
    (on March 21) of 2005. Trial No information is available on the defendant
    s trial. This trial took place in Branch One of the Revolutionary Court of
    Shiraz. Charges The charges against Mr. Gazav Mahmudzehi were announced as
    "sedition, possession and transportation of narcotics and weapons, and an
    armed clash with officials." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    According to the Khabare-Jonub newspaper, after the inspection of the
    defendants vehicle, 462 kilograms of opium, one kilogram of morphine, one
    weapon, and several Kalashnikovs were recovered. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Gazav Mahmudzehi to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme
    Court. He was hanged at Darvazeh Sa di in Shiraz.
