    News of the execution of an unknown person was published on the websites
    of Fars News Agency and the Ava-ye Khorasan-e Jonubi newspaper on May 15,
    2007, quoting the Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor’s Office of
    Sarbisheh (South Khorasan Province). Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge
    against the defendant was announced as “carrying 495 kilograms of opium
    and hashish.” According to the Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor’s
    Office of Sarbisheh, “he had a record of previous convictions.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment This defendant was hanged in Birjand on May 12, 2007.
