    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan, an Afghan citizen, along with his
    brother, was published on the websites of the Fars news agency, the E
    temad Meli newspaper, and the Ebrat newspaper on December 17, 2007. Arrest
    and Detention According to the E temad Meli newspaper, while the police
    investigation reached a dead-end after a few days, the inspector on the
    case suspected the building custodian, Hassan, based on the crime scene
    evidence and ordered his interrogation. Trial This trial took place in
    Branch Two of the Punitive Court of Esfahan. No further information is
    available about the defendant s trial. Charges The charge against Mr.
    Hassan was announced as "murder." According to the Public Relations Office
    of the Esfahan Court House, the defendant, in collaboration with his
    brother, entered a residential complex for robbery. They first murdered
    the woman occupant with a knife and then strangled the small child with a
    wire in order to avoid being identified. Finally, they stole some money
    and gold and fled the scene. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the E temad
    Meli newspaper, the defendant named some witnesses including his brother,
    Mohammad, as his alibi. This statement caused the arrest of his brother.
    After local investigation and questioning the residents, the police
    realized that the two brothers were seen around the complex on the day of
    the crime. According to the police technical interrogation reports, the
    brothers confessed their crime. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of torture to obtain confessions from detainees and
    have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress.
    Defense During interrogations, Mr. Hassan denied his involvement in this
    crime and stated that he had been out of town along with some of his
    friends. Judgment The Punitive Court and Branch 17 of the Esfahan Appeal
    Court condemned Mr. Hassan to death on December 15, 2005. This ruling was
    confirmed by Branch 37 of the Supreme Court on July 19, 2006. He was
    hanged in the presence of the victims' family and relatives at the Esfahan
    Central prison on December 17, 2007.
