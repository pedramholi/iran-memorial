    News of the execution of Mr. Ruhollah, from Jiroft, was published on the
    website of the Police Information Base on July 22, 2007. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on Mr. Ruhollah s arrest and
    detention. Trial This trial took place in Branch One of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Yazd. No further information is available on Mr.
    Ruhollah s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Ruhollah were announced
    as "armed transportation of more than 100 kilograms of opium, and
    murdering two police officers in 2000." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Ruhollah. .
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Ruhollah s defense. Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Ruhollah to death (two counts). He was hanged in
    public at Darvazeh Quran in Yazd on July 22, 2007.
