    News of the conviction and the execution of Mr. Nazirollah Ozbak, a
    national of Afghanistan, along with two others, was published on the
    websites of the Kayhan and Sharq newspapers on May 28, 2005, the Hamshahri
    newspaper on June 22, 2005, Khabare Jonub on May 1, 2006, the Javan
    newspaper on December 20, 2006, the Iran newspaper on July 6, 2004 and
    January 3, 2007, and Iscanews on January 3, 2007. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Ozbak’s arrest and detention vary according to the
    media reports. Based on one report, he was arrested in the Tajrish Circle
    in Tehran and according to the other report, he was arrested when he
    returned to the place of the crime and the neighbors informed the police.
    The date of his arrest was July 4 or 6, 2004. Trial This trial took place
    in Branch 74 of the Provincial Criminal Court in two open and closed
    sessions. Charges The charge against Mr. Ozbak was announced as “five
    counts murder.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the media reports, the
    victims’ bodies, who were prostitutes, were recovered from the basement of
    a half constructed house where the defendant lived. A cell phone was also
    recovered when he was body-searched. During the primary interrogations,
    the defendant denied committing any murder but when he could not explain
    the stolen cell phone and testimonies of the witnesses, he confessed.”
    According to the Javan and Iran newspapers, the defendant confessed to
    three murders but, according to Sharq and Kayhan , he confessed to five
    murders. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    In his defense in the court, Mr. Ozbak stated: “I deny the charges. I only
    killed one person, the same woman for whose murder I was arrested in a
    house in Niavaran [a district in Tehran].” He explained his motivation by
    saying: “When I brought that woman to the house, I noticed that she wanted
    to rob the place. She was collecting my belongings when I attacked and
    strangled her. I left her body there and when a few days later I went to
    that place to hide her body, I was arrested. I only accept this one
    murder.” Judgment The court condemned Mr. Nazirollah Ozbak to five death
    penalties but this ruling was rejected by the Supreme Court. The case was
    referred to Branch 74 of the court. The defendant was then condemned to
    three death penalties by hanging and the Supreme Court confirmed this
    verdict. He was hanged in Evin prison on January 3, 2007.
