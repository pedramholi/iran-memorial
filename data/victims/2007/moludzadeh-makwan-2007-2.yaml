    In October 2007, a dazed young man on donkeyback was paraded around the
    streets of Paveh, his head shaved against his will. His disgrace was only
    beginning. The news of the trial, sentencing, and execution of Makwan
    Moludzadeh was reported on the websites of the E temad newspaper (Sep. 28,
    Nov. 16, 2007; Jan. 4 2008), the web-blog of the journalist of this
    newspaper (Oct 29, Dec. 5 and 13), the newsletter of Amirkabir University
    in Tehran (AUT News, Oct. 29 and Dec. 15), the Fars News Agency (Dec. 12),
    Amnesty International (Oct. 26, Dec. 6 and 16), and Human Rights Watch
    (Dec. 5) of year 2007. Reports from various sources reflect numerous
    violations of both Iranian and international laws concerning
    interrogation, investigation, trial, issuing of the verdict and execution
    of the ruling. Consequently, this case has been widely reported by various
    human rights organizations, which demanded that the Iranian government and
    judiciary halt the execution of Mr. Moludzadeh. After the ruling, the
    defendant s father went to Tehran several times and unsuccessfully
    attempted to visit the head of the judiciary. Later, in a letter to
    Ayatollah Shahrudi, he stated: Makwan s mother and I beg you to help us
    save his life. Our twenty-year old son has been condemned to death in
    contradiction with religious rules and Islamic law. After the arrest of
    our son in [Sep. 23 Oct. 22, 2006], we did not even know his charge. I
    implore you, in my helplessness, to order the review of Makwan s case. In
    November 2007, due to Makwan s attorney s struggles, and those of human
    rights organizations, Ayatollah Shahrudi, the Head of the Judiciary,
    ordered a temporary stay of execution. In his rationale, Mr. Shahrudi
    referred to the Ayatollah Khamene i s edict, which states that anal sex
    must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Head of the Judiciary
    ordered the Office for the Implementation of Sentences to reinvestigate
    the case and send its findings to the criminal court of Kermanshah for the
    review. When this order was received by this Office, Makwan s attorney was
    told that it would take at least two months to reinvestigate the case.
    However, a few days later, the verdict was hastily resent to Tehran,
    returned to Kermanshah, and the sentence was carried out. In a press
    release issued after the execution, the Public Prosecution office of
    Kermanshah Province rejected the protests regarding the accusations that
    religious and legal principles had been violated in the case as baseless
    and stressed that there is no doubt of the fact that the hideous act of
    homosexual rape must be punished with execution in Islamic law. AUT News,
    quoting from the web-blog of Kuhyar Gudarz, referred to hostility between
    the prosecutor and the Moludzadeh family: It appears that Makwan, who had
    a short temper, once drove his car recklessly in front of the city
    prosecutor, after which there were several clashes between them. Once the
    prosecutor told him: Makwan, I ll finally kill you. The reasons for the
    non-implementation of Shahrudi s order of stay, as well as whether or not
    the violators were prosecuted, are not known. Before the execution,
    Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch released statements appealing
    to the Iranian regime to prevent the execution of Makwan Moludzadeh. These
    statements pointed out that the accused was 13 at the time of the alleged
    crime, and the execution sentence is in violation of international and
    national Iranian law. International law strictly prohibits the execution
    of those convicted of crimes committed under the age of 18. As a party to
    the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
    Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran is bound by international
    obligation not to execute minors. Arrest and detention Mr. Makwan
    Moludzadeh was arrested on October 1, 2006, by the order of the prosecutor
    of Paveh in Kermanshah province. According to E temad Melli , he was
    arrested as he was smoking in the garden at the back of their house. His
    parents were under the impression that he had been arrested because of
    smoking during the fasting month. A few days later, still unaware of
    Makwan s charge, his family found out that Makwan s head had been shaved
    and he was forced to sit on a donkey and tour the city in order to be
    humiliated. The newspaper quote Makwan s father saying: That day, I saw
    that they put him on a donkey and let everyone see him. People would ask
    us with what charge they forced him to ride a donkey, but we didn t know
    what to say. Makwan had done nothing to deserve such humiliation.
    According to Amnesty International (Nov. 26, 2007), Makwan was ill-treated
    during his interrogations in Paveh. As a protest to such ill-treatment, it
    was reported that Makwan had a food strike for ten days. Trial Mr.
    Moludzadeh was tried at Branch One of the Criminal Court of Kermanshah.
    Some trial sessions took place in his home town Paveh. His attorney
    pointed out numerous flaws in the proceedings: At the trial, required by
