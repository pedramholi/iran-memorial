    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan Madadi was published on the websites
    of the Khorasan newspaper and IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on July
    9, 2007, quoting the Public Relations Office of Khorasan Provincial Court.
    Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. This trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Birjand. Charges The charges against Mr. Madadi were announced
    as, “participation in supply and armed transportation of 1300 kilograms of
    opium and 950 grams of hashish.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hassan Madadi
    to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Public Prosecutor of the
    country. According to the Khorasan newspaper, he was hanged in Birjand on
    July 7, and according to IRNA, on July 9, 2007.
