    The execution of Mr. Hossein Gharebaghlu, along with eight other
    individuals, was published on the websites of the ISCA News Agency
    (October 17, 2007) and The Human Rights of Iran (October 23). Additional
    information about him and his trial has been taken from the Javan
    newspaper (June 26), and the E temad Melli newspaper (December 14) 2006,
    as well as the website of Khabar-e Jonub (March 3, 2007). The Farsi
    sources mentioned his name as Hossein Gh. The website of The Human Rights
    of Iran reflected his last name. According to these sources, Mr.
    Gharebaghlu was 18 at the time of execution and 16 at the time he
    allegedly committed the crime. International laws have strictly prohibited
    capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time
    of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and Detention According to the indictment by the
    representative of the Public Prosecution Office, the officers were
    informed of a fight resulting in injury in the Fadak Park near Eslamshahr
    [Tahran province]. Before the officers arrived at the scene, the injured
    person was transferred to the Sa idieh Hospital. After going to the
    hospital, they realized that the victim, Mahmud, had died (the Javan
    newspaper). According to Khabar-e Jonub , witnesses stated that the victim
    was killed in a fight with his friend, Hossein. Therefore the officers
    went to the defendant s house and arrested him. According to the E temad
    Melli newspaper, Hossein was transferred to the Center for Rehabilitation
    and Training but escaped when he was going to be tried in the Penal Court
    of Tehran on April 19, 2005. Later, he was rearrested. Trial During the
    investigation session for this case in Branch 71 of the Penal Court of
    Tehran, the representative of the Public Prosecution Office stated in his
    indictment: The defendant explained his motivation for murder as an
    immoral request by the victim and the fighting seemingly occurred in two
    phases. In the second phase, the defendant claimed that since he knew
    about the victim s intention, he had put the knife in his pocket and
    struck the victim in his chest in the presence of his brother, uncle, and
    friends. The testimonies of these people are in the file. He added: The
    forensics investigation declared the cause of death as the heart being
    torn by a sharp object in the chest which confirms the indications. With
    the repetition of the defendant s criminal act and based on articles 206
    and 207 of the Islamic Penal Code, I request the lawful and religious
    punishment for him (the Javan newspaper). The investigation continued
    behind closed doors in order to analyze details of the murder. Charges Mr.
    Hossein Gharebaghlu was charged with murder. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence provided against the defendant was his confessions and the
    statements of witnesses. One witness told the court: Hossein (the
    defendant) and I were outside when Mahmud (the victim) called upon Hossein
    and told the rest of us to stay away, [at the distance of] about 30
    meters. They went away... [When I heard shouts and cries,] I went and saw
    that four of them wanted to hurt Hossein [Then] Hossein returned with a
    chain in his hand. The fighting started and I saw that Mahmud went back
    and suddenly fell on the ground [Prior to this, I had seen] Hossein
    stepping backwards saying: don t hurt me, let me go. I had heard Mahmud
    saying: I want to sodomize him (the Javan newspaper). International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the
    case of political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised.
    The National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners
    plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their
    political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations
    have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those
    prisoners who are freed. Defense In his defense, Mr. Hossein Gharebaghlu
    stated that the victim in
