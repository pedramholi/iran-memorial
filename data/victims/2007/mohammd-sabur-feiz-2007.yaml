    News of the execution of Mr. Sabur Feiz Mohammad was published on the
    websites of Fars News Agency, Qom News, and the Police News Website on
    November 6, IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) and ISCA news on November
    7, and the Iran newspaper on November 8, 2007. Mr. Feiz Mohammad was a
    21-years old Afghan citizen. Arrest and Detention According to the Deputy
    Chief of the Public Prosecutor s Office in Qom, on April 23, 2005, police
    were informed by a phone call made by a worker in a residential complex
    that a man who seemed suspicious was walking around aimlessly and
    receiving some addicts. Police arrested him in Mahtab rest area in the
    20thKm of Qom-Tehran freeway. (Irna) Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Qom tried Mr. Feiz Mohammad. No further information is available about
    his trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Sabur Feiz Mohammad were
    announced as "transporting and importing 291 grams of heroin from
    Afghanistan to Iran by body packing." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Feiz Mohammad was his confession
    regarding smuggling narcotics from Afghanistan and recovery of several
    heroin packages during a body search. According to the Deputy Chief of the
    Public Prosecutor s Office in Qom, the defendant was transferred to a
    hospital due to his grave health condition, after being arrested. Doctors
    noticed that he had swallowed heroin packages and one of them that was
    torn apart in his body had caused poisoning symptoms. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Feiz Mohammad's defense. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Sabur Feiz Mohammad to death on June 22, 2007 and the
    ruling was confirmed by the Public Prosecutor s Office. According to the
    Deputy Chief of the Public Prosecutor s Office in Qom, his request for
    pardon was rejected in order to give other smugglers of narcotics a
    lesson. (Qom News, November 6, 2007) Mr. Sabur Feiz Mohammad was hanged in
    public at the Keshavarz Square in Qom on November 7, 2007. After Mr. Feiz
    Mohammad s execution, in an interview with IRNA, the public relations
    officer of the General and Revolutionary Courts of Qom said: "in
    accordance with Article 8 of the Amended Anti-narcotic Law, anyone who
    imports over 30 grams of heroin into the country will be sentenced to
    death and confiscation of property, with the exception of normal standard
    living costs for the family. "(IRNA November 7, 2007)
