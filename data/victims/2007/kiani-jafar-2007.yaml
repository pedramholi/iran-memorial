    News of the execution of Mr. Ja far Kiani was published on the websites of
    Amnesty International, the E temad Melli newspaper, Noruz, and Ruz on July
    9, 2007; IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) and the Sharq newspaper on
    July 15; ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) and the E temad newspaper on
    July 11; IRNA on July 10; Varash blog on July 6; Tuday Link on July 8;
    Kavirnameh on June 20; Entekhab newspaper on July 10 and 31; Asre-Iran on
    July 8 and August 5; Jame-Jam on September 30, 2007; and Baraye-Azadi
    Weblog on February 24, 2007. The execution of this ruling had a widespread
    reflection on the national and international media. The United Nations and
    international community consider stoning as an inhumane punishment and
    torture. However, Mohammadjavad Larijani, the Head of Iran Human Rights
    Base, rejected this criticism and stated, Stoning is neither torture nor
    unsuitable punishment. And, this is only the westerners interpretation.
    Nevertheless, this ruling created a discussion among the Islamic Republic
    officials regarding the regime s interests. This case had two defendants.
    The other defendant, Mokarrameh Ebrahimi, had problems with her first
    husband and filed for divorce at the Family Court of Eslamshahr eleven
    years before. According to the existing information, Mokarrameh requested
    the divorce and got into temporary marriage [Sigheh] with Ja far Kiani.
    They had two children together. One of them was born in the prison and
    both children spent most of their lives with Mokarameh in the prison.
    Meanwhile, her first husband did not file any complaint against
    Mokarrameh. Arrest and Detention Mr. Ja far Kiani and his wife, Mokarrameh
    Ebrahimi, were arrested in Takestan for adultery in 1995. Sometimes later,
    when they had only one child, they were released on bail. After a year,
    they were rearrested. It is unknown if the defendants had an attorney.
    However, Ms. Shadi Sadr, stated years later that, as the attorney of the
    case, I could not read it. I only received a copy of the case which was
    not complete. Trial This trial first took place in a court in Takestan in
    1995. The judge condemned the defendant and his wife to death with
    stoning. However, this ruling was rejected by the Supreme Court due to
    lack of enough proofs. Then, it was referred to Branch 101 of Takestan
    Criminal Court. Charges The charge against Mr. Ja far Kiani was announced
    as "adultery with married woman." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt According to Ms. Shadi
    Sardr, Mr. Ja far Kiani never confessed to illegitimate relationship and
    there is no witness in the case. The judge issued the stoning sentence
    only based on his own knowledge. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Ja far Kiani's defense. According to the media reports, this case had
    several legal and religious problems. The official judiciary clerk has
    issued a temporary marriage certificate [Sigheh] for 99 years based on the
    absentia divorce certificate of Mokarrameh. Additionally, their children
    had official and legal identification cards. According to Ms. Shadi Sardr,
    Mokarrameh was an illiterate and simple woman who couldn t read or write
    when arrested. According to the existing reports, Mr. Ja far Kiani was
    convicted only based on the judge's knowledge. Whereas, according to
    Ayatollah Hossein ali Montazeri, in his interview with Radio Farda,
    Carrying out the ruling only based on the judge s knowledge is
    problematic. What happened in Takestan recently was against Shari a law.
    During an interview with ISNA, the Head of Appeal Court in Tehran
    considered the judge's knowledge insufficient to issue the ruling and said
    the common knowledge must be obtained. Also, according to the spokesman to
    judiciary, regarding stoning in Islam, there were cases hardly provable.
    (IRNA) The Head of Human Rights Base for the Judiciary, Mohammadjavad
    Larijani, called this ruling a mistake. Judgment The stoning ruling
    against Mr. Ja far Kiani based on the Judge s knowledge was confirmed by
    the Pardon Commission of the Judiciary and was suppose to be carried out
    in public in Takestan on June 21, 2007. In the morning of June 20, the
    ruling was stopped by the order of Hashemi Shahrudi, the Head of Judiciary
    and referred to be investigated further. However, the judge transferred
    the defendant to Aqchekand Village and ordered the ruling to be carried
    out on July 5, 2007 in the morning. According to local residents, the
    ruling was carried out only in presence of the judge and agents
    accompanied him. According to Asre-Iran, quoting Mokarrameh s attorney,
    Based on unofficial reports, Ja far was still alive in spite of his nose
    and ear were smashed. When the coroner physician confirmed that he was
    alive, someone smashed his head with a cement block and killed him. This
    is prosecutable charge if proven. According to Ms. Shadi Sardr, the stone
    were so large that even the form o
