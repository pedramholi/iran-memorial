    News of the execution of an unknown person was published on the website of
    Nasirboushehr on December 30, 2007. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. According to
    what was heard from this source, the defendant was identified and arrested
    by the police after he had a secret life and formed a family for 15 years.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    charge against the defendant was announced as "murder." According to the
    above source, the defendant had killed his neighbor 15 years ago. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on the defendant's defense. Judgment
    No specific information is available about the defendant s execution. He
    was hanged at the Abdan Studium in Bushehr in late December of 2007.
