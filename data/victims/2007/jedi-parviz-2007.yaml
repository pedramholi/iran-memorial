    News of the execution of Mr. Parviz Jedi, along with another person, was
    published on the websites of Fars News Agency and Police Information Base
    on May 15, and ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on May 16, 2007. Arrest
    and Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest
    and detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    This trial took place in Branch One of the Revolutionary Court of Bandar
    Abbas. Charges The charges against Mr. Parviz Jedi were announced as
    purchasing, carrying, and possessing 297 kilograms of hashish and 124
    grams of opium, selling 50 kilograms of hashish, and having a record of
    previous conviction. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    According to the Fars News Agency, based on the case, the defendant loaded
    297 kilograms of hashish in Iranshahr and hid this in a house in Bandar
    Abbas. He confessed to purchasing it from a Pakistani man for a Peykan car
    and 26 million Tomans. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on the defense. Judgment The court condemned
    Mr. Parviz Jedi to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He
    was hanged at the Nakhle-Nakhoda intersection in Bandar Abbas on May 15,
    2007.
