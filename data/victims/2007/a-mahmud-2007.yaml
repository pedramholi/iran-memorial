    News of the execution of Mr. Mahmud A. was published on the website of
    Fars news agency on January 15, 2007. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. This trial
    took place in Branch 6 of the Criminal Court of Qom. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Mahmud A. were announced as "kidnapping and acts incompatible
    with chastity." According to Fars news agency, "He had deceitfully
    kidnapped a twenty year old man last year." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. The Public and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor of Qom did not offer any explanation or details of the
    deceitful kidnapping of a twenty year old man. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mahmud’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mahmud
    A. to death and Branch 27 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He
    was hanged in Shahid Mahalati Square of Qom on January 15, 2007.
