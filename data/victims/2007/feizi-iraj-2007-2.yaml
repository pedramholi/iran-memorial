    News of the execution of Mr. Iraj Feizi was published on the websites of
    the Fars news agency on October 25, 2007. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Iraj Feizi was announced as “murder.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    According to the Fars news agency report, “the defendant murdered a young
    man with a knife blow to his heart in public in 2006.” Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Feizi’s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Iraj Feizi to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged in the central prison of Ilam on October 25, 2007.
