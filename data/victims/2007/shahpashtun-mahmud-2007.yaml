    News of the execution of Mr. Mahmud Shahpashtun, along with another
    person, was published on the website of IRNA (Islamic Republic News
    Agency) on November 24, 2007, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Sistan and Baluchestan Judiciary. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge
    against the defendant was announced as “carrying three kilograms and 500
    grams of heroin.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment The court condemned this person to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Judicial officials. He
    was hanged in the Zahedan prison yard on December 2, 2007.
