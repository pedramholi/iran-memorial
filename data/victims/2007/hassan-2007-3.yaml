    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan (without a last name), along with
    another person, was published on the website of the News Base for the
    Islamic Republic Security Forces on November 13, 2007. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on Mr. Hassan s arrest and
    detention but he was arrested and imprisoned in relation to plan called:
    To Advance the Social Order . Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Hassan s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Hassan was announced as
    "transporting narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Hassan. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Hassan's defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Hassan to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme
    Court. He was hanged in the Central prison of Yazd in November of 2007.
    The exact date of this execution is unknown. *Since 2007, a series of
    police operations began in cooperation with the Judiciary, the
    Revolutionary Guards, the Ministry of intelligence, and the Basij
    Resistance Force all over the country, especially in Tehran. First phases
    of this plan, was introduced as a plan To Advance the Social Order or
    General Chastity Plan , focused on women s hijab. During the next phases,
    arresting drug addicts and those who were characterized by the Islamic
    Republic s authorities as Villains and Hooligans , and inspecting of
    workshops, dress shops, barber shops, photo shops, etc. were also added to
    the police agenda.
