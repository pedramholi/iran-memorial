    News of the execution of three unknown individuals was published on the
    websites of IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on October 27, and Maybod
    News on October 28, 2007, quoting the Police Information Center of Yazd
    Province. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendants’ arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendants’ trial. Charges These defendants were collectively charged with
    “carrying, possession, and distribution of various narcotics.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendants. Defense No information is available on the
    defense. Judgment The court condemned these three defendants to death. Two
    of them were hanged in the Central prison of Yazd and the other person was
    hanged in Ardakan (Yazd Province) on October 27, 2007.
