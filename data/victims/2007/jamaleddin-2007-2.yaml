    News of the conviction and execution of Mr. Jamalodin, along with two
    others, was published on the websites of the Sharq newspaper on May 5,
    2004 and October 6, 2005, the Hamshahri newspaper on October 17, 2004, the
    E temad Melli newspaper on May 16, 2007, and the Farhang Ashti newspaper
    on May 17, 2007. Mr. Jamalodin, 35, was married and worked as a janitor at
    a house in Shahrak-e Gharb, Tehran. Arrest and Detention According to the
    media reports, following the disappearance of another janitor who lived in
    his neighborhood, police sought Mr. Jamalodin. On August 2, 2003, a woman
    contacted the Police Station 134 in Shahrak-e Gharb stating that her
    husband has gone to Mr. Jamalodin to repair his satellite dish system and
    never returned. She explained that when she and her daughter went to Mr.
    Jamalodin s house, they found it closed. About an hour later, Mr.
    Jamalodin went to their house and told them that he took her husband to a
    hospital and had no news of him. When detectives went to Mr. Jamalodin s
    house, they realized that no one was inside. After they entered the house,
    they found the victim s bloody body inside a plastic bag in the bathroom.
    Mr. Jamalodin and his wife were in hiding for five months until they
    surrendered to the Police Station in Saqez. Trial Branch 74 of the
    Criminal Court of Tehran Province tried Mr. Jamalodin s case in three
    closed sessions. No further information is available about this trial.
    Charges The charge against Mr. Jamalodin was announced as "murder." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Jamalodin was his
    confession, the confession of his wife, and the fact that the body was
    found in their house and they disappeared after the murder . Defense In
    his defense, Mr. Jamalodin stated that defending his honor had been his
    sole motivation and said: the victim molested my wife forcefully and
    threatened her several times. When my wife told me, I asked the victim to
    come to my house and I hid in the bathroom. Thinking that my wife was
    alone, the victim attacked her. I got out of the bathroom, attacked him,
    and struck him with several blows of a knife. Judgment The court condemned
    Mr. Jamalodin to death and Branch 27 of the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged in the Evin Prison on May 16, 2007.
