    News of Mr. Akbar Abbasi s execution was published on the websites of
    Kurdistan News Human Rights Watch (October 23, 2007) and Kurdistan Human
    Rights Defense Organization (December 10, 2007). Additional information
    about this case was obtained from an interview conducted by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with two of his ward mates on February 28,
    2018, and April 3, 2018. Mr. Abbasi was approximately 50 years old,
    married, an adherent of the Shafe i Sunni branch of Islam, and residing in
    the village of Terval near Dehgolan in Kurdistan Province. He had an
    elementary school education. Mr. Abbasi was a farmer. He was a fearless
    and well-mannered man with a good sense of humor and great spirits. Mr.
    Abbasi resided in the village of Terval whose residents hail from the
    Zandi tribe, and was considered one of the major landowners of the
    village. For that reason, villagers had spite for him and wanted him to
    leave the region. Mr. Abbasi s case was related to a murder in the village
    of Terval near the town of Qaraveh, in the Spring of 2005. Arrest and
    detention In April 2005, on the day of the incident, Mr. Abbasi called the
    Qaraveh police department and informed them of what had transpired at his
    home, and asked them to come over and arrest him. Criminal Investigations
    detectives arrested Mr. Abbasi and took him to the Criminal Investigations
    Bureau. Mr. Abbasi also spent a few months at the Qaraveh Prison. In the
    Fall of 2005, Mr. Abbasi was transferred to [the city of] Sanandaj Central
    Prison, Ward Four. He had access to an attorney during his detention and
    met with his lawyer in prison several times. He was also able to meet his
    family in person. Mr. Abbasi was incarcerated at Sanandaj Prison for one
    year and three months. Trial One of Kurdistan Province Criminal Court
    branches tried Mr. Abbasi in 2005; there is no information, however,
    regarding the trial session(s). Charges The charge against Mr. Abbasi was
    murder . According to available information, on the day of the event, Mr.
    Abbasi had gone to Qaraveh to bring back some equipment when he learned
    that individuals belonging to one of the village tribes had attacked his
    home and intended to rape his wife and daughters. Having previously
    procured a weapon for self-defense, he returned home and started firing on
    the individuals there, killing two and injuring several others. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence used against Mr. Abbasi was his confession,
    the family s complaint, a complaint lodged by a member of the town
    council, statements by the villagers, and possession of a firearm .
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense Mr. Abbasi had repeatedly been put under pressure to
    sell his land and leave the village by the villagers, who belonged to one
    of the tribes of the village of Terval. He had been threatened that his
    wife and daughters would be raped if he did not do so. Mr. Abbasi fired
    upon the attackers in defense of his family. (Interview with his ward
    mate, February 28, 2018). Mr. Abbasi s family also believed that the
    killing of those two individuals was legitimate self-defense and that
    there was no other motive. (Kurdistan News Human Rights Watch). There is
    no information regarding his defense and the defense presented by his
    attorney. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Judgment One of Kurdistan Province
    Criminal Court branches sentenced Mr. Abbasi to death. On Monday morning,
    October 22, 2007, Mr. Abbasi was hanged at Sanandaj Prison. According to
    Mr. Abbasi s ward mate, Mr. Abbasi was not afraid of execution. Before
    being taken for the implementation of the sentence, he said good bye to
    his ward mates and asked them to forgive him [and his sins].
