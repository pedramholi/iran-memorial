    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan D. was published on the website of the
    Police Information Base on June 7, 2007. Arrest and Detention According to
    the above source, Mr. Hassan D. was identified and arrested by Chalus
    police. No further information is available about Mr. Hassan D. s arrest

    No further information is available about Mr. Hassan D. s trial. Charges
    The charges against Mr. Hassan D. were announced as "rape and murder."
    According to the above source, he raped and murdered a woman in Chalus in
    2004. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year
    Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Hassan D. was his confession . International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of torture to obtain confessions from detainees and
    have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Hassan D. s defense. Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Hassan D. to death and the ruling was confirmed by
    the judicial authorities. He was hanged in the presence of judicial and
    security officials of Tonekabon on June 1, 2007.
