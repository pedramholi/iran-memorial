    News of the execution of Mr. Akbar Akbari was published on the websites of
    Fars News Agency on January 23, ISCA news on March 5, ISNA (Iranian
    Students News Agency) on July 2, 3, the Mardomsalari newspaper on July 2,
    the E temad Melli newspaper on July 7, the Iran newspaper on July 8, and
    the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office of Esfahan on July 2, 4,
    7, 11, 2007. Arrest and Detention According to the media reports, after
    eight women complained and reported being raped by an unknown man in an
    area under the jurisdiction of Police Station 23, the defendant s arrest
    was ordered by the police in the greater Esfahan. They managed to arrest
    the defendant two weeks later when he was about to enter into the next
    victim s house. Trial No information is available on the defendant s
    trial. This trial took place in Branch 16 of the Punitive Court of
    Esfahan. Charges The charges against the defendant were announced as
    "forceful entries to houses and rape." According to the media reports,
    after the defendant identified lonely women, he would enter their homes
    and forcefully raped them. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided
    against the defendant was his confession and being identified by the
    plaintiffs. According to the Judge of Branch 16 of the Appeal Court, rapes
    were proven in two cases. Defense During the trial and in his defense, the
    defendant stated, I watched pornographic movies and became excited and
    then planned devilishly to enter women s houses in order to rape them.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Akbar Akbari to death and the ruling was
    confirmed by Branch 27 of the Supreme Court. The execution date was
    postponed after a pardon request to the Pardon Commission. After the
    request was denied by the Pardon Commission of Esfahan, the defendant was
    hanged in the Central prison of Esfahan on July 7, 2007.
