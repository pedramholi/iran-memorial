    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Karam Z. was published on the website of
    the Police Information Base on May 20, 2007. Arrest and Detention There is
    no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge
    against the defendant was announced as “carrying and disbursing of 20
    kilograms of heroin.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ali Karam Z. to
    death. He was hanged in public in Khamir, Hormozgan Province, in May of
    2007. The report of this execution does not mention any confirmation of
    the ruling by the Supreme Court.
