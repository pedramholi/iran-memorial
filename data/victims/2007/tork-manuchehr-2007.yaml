    News of the execution of Mr. Manuchehr Tork, along with two others, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper and on the website of Khabar-e
    Jonub on November 18, 2007. Additional information was taken from the
    website of the Committee of Human Rights Reporters on November 14 and 18,
    2007, ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on November 14, 2007, Fars news
    agency on July 20, 2006, and the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on February 22,
    2006. His case and the cases of three others were related to the murder of
    three shepherds at the Zamanabad Village near Malayer on November 5, 2005.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Tork was arrested on November 9, 2005. After a
    relative of the victims filed a complaint, criminal police inspectors in
    Malayer and Hamadan investigated the case and arrested nine members of a
    tribe. They arrested three more individuals after the confession of one of
    the arrestees. (Khabar-e Jonub) Trial The Criminal Court in Hamadan tried
    Mr. Tork and the other defendants. The first trial session took place on
    February 20, 2006 (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper). No information is available
    on his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Tork and another
    person were announced as stewardship in murders. According to the existing
    information, he, his uncle (grandfather), and his two other relatives had
    murdered three young shepherds by blows of a knife at gardens around the
    Zamanabad Village over tribal disputes. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Tork was his confession and the confession
    of his collaborator, the forensics report, and complaints by the victims
    families. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Tork defended himself
    during the trial and his attorney stated his last defense. However, no
    information is available on the content of his defense. Judgment The
    Criminal Court of Hamadan condemned Mr. Manuchehr Tork to death. Branch 16
    of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and the Head of Judiciary
    validate it on June 19, 2006. He was hanged, along with two others, at the
    Hamadan Prison yard on November 15, 2007. The fourth defendant was
    condemned to 5 years imprisonment for assisting the murderers.
