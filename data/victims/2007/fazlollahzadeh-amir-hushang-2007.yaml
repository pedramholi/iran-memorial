    News of the execution of Mr. Amir Hushang Fazlollahzadeh was published on
    the website of Varesh, Asieh Amini weblog, on March 1, 2008. Additional
    information was taken from the website of Mazandnumeh on January 27, 2005.
    His case was related to the murder of a 19-year-old man in Tonokabon,
    Mazandaran, during a fight in 2004. Mr. Fazlollahzadeh was only 16 years
    old when the crime was committed. International laws have strictly
    prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18
    at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil
    and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran
    has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed
    before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr. Fazlollahzadeh was
    arrested after the fight and was detained for three years. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Fazlollahzadeh s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Fazlollahzadeh was announced as murder. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Fazlollahzadeh was his confession and having a record of harassment in the
    neighborhood. (website of Mazandnumeh) International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr.
    Fazlollahzadeh was younger than 18 when the crime was committed. He was in
    a fight with three individuals who beat him and threatened him with a
    knife when he defended himself and hit an individual s leg with a knife.
    Because of the bleeding that person died on his way to a hospital. The
    victim had a record for harassment in the neighborhood. No information is
    available on Mr. Fazlollahzadeh s defense. Judgment Mr. Amir Hushang
    Fazlollahzadeh was condemned to death. He was hanged in public in
    Khoramabad, Tonokabon, in the fall of 2007. The victim s father carried
    out the ruling.
