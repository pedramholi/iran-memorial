    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Shahryari, along with another person, was
    published on the websites of ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) and
    Hormozgan Province Court House on March 11, 2007, quoting the Public
    Relations Office of Hormozgan Province Court House. Arrest and Detention
    According to the report, the defendant was arrested after an intense clash
    with the police. Trial No information is available on the defendants
    trial. This trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Minab.
    Charges The charge against Mr. Ali Shahryari was announced as,
    participation in possession and transportation of 116 kilograms of opium.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided
    against the defendant was announced as, his Peugeot car containing the
    narcotics that was confiscated by the government. Defense No information
    is available on the defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ali
    Shahryari to death. His pardon and punishment reduction requests were
    rejected in the Provincial Pardon Commission. He was hanged at the main
    square of Minab on March 8, 2007. No information is available regarding
    the appeal of this case to a higher court.
