    News of the execution of Mr. A. A. was published on the website of the
    Kayhan newspaper on November 20, 2007. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. This trial took place
    in the Court of Gonbad-e Kavus. Charges The charges against the defendant
    were announced as "forceful entry, destruction of home properties,
    robbery, and murder in 2003." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. A. A. to death
    and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was executed in
    public in Gonbad-e Kavus in November 2007. The exact date of this
    execution is unknown. Mr. A. A. was 29 years old.
