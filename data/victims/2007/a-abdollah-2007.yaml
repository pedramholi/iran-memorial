    News of the execution of Mr. 'Abdollah 'A., an Afghan citizen along with
    another Afghan, was published on the website of the Fars news agency on
    July 23, 2007 quoting the Social and Advisory Assistant of the Security
    Headquarters of the Central Province. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    According to the Fars news agency report, the defendants were arrested by
    the security forces of Delijan in 2006. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. 'Abdollah 'A.
    were announced as "carrying and importing heroin." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defence
    No information is available on Mr. 'Abdollah 'A.'s defence. Judgment The
    circumstances of this defendant’s execution are not known. According to
    the above source, Mr. 'Abdollah 'A. was hanged in the Delijan prison yard
    after due process.
