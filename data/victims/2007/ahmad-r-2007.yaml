circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad R. was published on the websites of
    ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on October 30, and the Aftab Yazd
    newspaper on November 1, 2007. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. R.'s trial
    took place in the Criminal Court. No information is available on the
    details of his trial. Charges The charges against the defendant were
    reported as "kidnapping, rape, and several seditious acts". The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The Aftab Yazdnewspaper report referred to
    evidence that proved the defendant destroyed several families with his
    lustfulness, but there is no explanation regarding the mentioned evidence.
    Defense No information is available on the defendant's defense. Judgment
    The court identified Mr. Ahmad R. as Mofsed (corruptor) and condemned him
    to death. The ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court and he was hanged
    in public at the Farahan Square in Arak on October 30, 2007.
