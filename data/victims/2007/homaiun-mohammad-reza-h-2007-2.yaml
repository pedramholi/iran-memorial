    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza H. (Homaiun) was published on
    the websites of the Iran newspaper on April 15, ISNA (Iranian Students
    News Agency) on April 24, and the Khabare Jonub newspaper on April 26,
    2007. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant s arrest and detention. Trial This trial took place at the
    Marvdasht Court House. No further information is available on Mr. Mohammad
    Reza H. s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Mohammad Reza H. was
    announced as "murder." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide specific information on the evidence presented
    against the defendant. According to the Khabare Jonubnewspaper, the
    defendant murdered a person with a knife in the village of Kushk on August
    8, 2004, during a fight. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Mohammad Reza H. s 's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad
    Reza H. (Homaiun) to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme
    Court and the Head of the Judiciary. He was hanged in public in Sahlabad,
    Marvdasht, on April 24, 2007. Mr. Mohammad Reza H. (Homaiun) was 25 years
    old.
