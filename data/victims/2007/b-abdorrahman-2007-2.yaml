    News of the execution of Mr. Abdorrahman B., along with another person,
    was published on the websites of Fars News Agency and Police Information
    Base on May 15, and ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on May 16, 2007.
    Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s
    arrest and detention. He was arrested in July of 2004. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. According to the media
    reports, this case was twice remanded to the Revolutionary Court of Bandar
    Khamir for problems issued by the Supreme Court. Charges The charge
    against this person was announced as “carrying 20 kilograms of heroin.”
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendants. Defense No information is available on
    the defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Abdorrahman B. to death and
    the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in Bandar Khamir
    (Hormozgan Province) on May 15, 2007.
