    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza M., along with four others, was
    published on the E temad and Javan newspapers on March 8, 2007. Additional
    information regarding this case has been collected from the websites of
    the Hamshahri newspaper (August 3, 2005), the Iran newspaper (August 10,
    2005), the Sharq newspaper (August 3, 2005 and May 15, 2006), and the
    Abrar newspaper (May 15, 2006). andMr. Mohammad Reza M. was single and 50
    years old. His case was related to the murder of a 49-year-old man in a
    Photo Studio, in the Falake Dovom in Fardis (Karaj) on September 3,
    2004.Arrest and Detention Mr. Mohammad Reza M. was arrested by the
    Officers from the Fardis Police station on September 3, 2004. He was
    interrogated by the Branch 19 of the prosecution office of Karaj the day
    after he was arrested. On the day of the incident, Mr. Mohammad Reza M. ,
    while his face was wounded and in blood, panicky went down the stairs of a
    shopping mall in Falake Dovom in Fardis (Karaj) and told people on the
    street that there had been a murder in the Photo Studio. Since nobody paid
    attention to him, he contacted the police and claimed that he had killed
    his old friend. There is also another version of Mr. Mohammad Reza M. s
    arrest published in some media which indicates that people saw a man
    fleeing with bloody appearance at the Falake Dovom in Fardis (Karaj). They
    reported it to the police and the defendant was arrested subsequently.
    Trial The judge and his four assistant at the Branch 74 of the Criminal
    Court of Tehran Province tried Mr. Mohammad Reza M. on August 02, 2005.
    There is no further information available on the details of his trial.
    Charges The charge against Mr. Mohammad Reza M. was announced as
    "premeditated murder." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    According to reports, the evidence presented against the defendant was his
    confession , the murdered body in blood in the photo shop, some murder
    tools such as a plaster night lamp (or vase), photography cutter, a
    kettle, some yarn in the mouth of the murdered, a belt, and Mr. Mohammad
    Reza s hands and face that were injured as a result of fight with the
    murdered. According to the statement by the representative of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office, the defendant was sent to the forensics office and
    the report confirmed no insanity of the defendant at the time if the
    crime. (Abrar newspaper) International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    In his defense, Mr. Mohammad Reza M. emphasized that he had no intention
    of killing the murdered. He continued by saying that: the victim owed me
    2.4 million Tomans for a car I had sold him in 2003. I had tried several
    ways including sending intermediators to get my money back but did not
    succeed . He had once field a complaint against him but could not defend
    his claim. On the day of the incident, he was determined to get his money
    back. I was tired wanted to get my money. (E temad Javan) I had asked him
    several times and sent many intermediators but he never paid attention.
    That money was all I had . (Hamshahri)Mr. Mohammad Reza M. Continues that
    when I went to him and asked for my money, he threatened me and told me
    angrily not go to his shop anymore. I was frustrated and angry. A fight
    broke up between us which resulted to him being killed. Mr. Mohammad Reza
    M. had no criminal background. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad
    Reza M. to death and the ruling was confirmed by Branch 26 of the Supreme
    Court. He was hanged in the Evin prison yard on March 7, 2007.
