    Mr. Musavi was only 16 at the time of crime and a student at a vocational
    high school. News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Musavi was published on
    the websites of the E temad Melli newspaper on June 8, and Farsnegar on
    July 2, 2007. Additional information was taken from the websites of the
    Hamshahri newspaper on May 12, 2005, ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency)
    on April 29, 2005, and Amnesty International on October 26, 2006. This
    case was related to a street fight that resulted in the murder of a
    21-year-old man in Shiraz in 2002. Mr. Musavi was 16 years old at the time
    and a student at a vocational high school. International laws have
    strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the
    age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the
    Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence
    committed before the age of eighteen. In a statement published on October
    26, 2006, Amnesty International demanded nullification of the death
    penalty for defendants under 18, including Mr. Musavi. Arrest and
    Detention According to the General Manager of the Shiraz Central Prison,
    Mr. Musavi entered this prison on June 3, 2003. (Farsnegar) However, the
    circumstances of his arrest and detention, especially the period between
    his arrest and entry into the prison, are not known. Mr. Musavi had been
    detained in the Shiraz Central Prison (Adelabad Prison) in Shiraz for four
    years before being executed. During this period, his mother visited the
    judge several times, objecting to her son s detention at the Adelabad
    Prison and requesting his transfer to the Jouvenile Rehabilitation Center.
    The E temad Melli newspaper quoted his mother saying: I went before the
    judge of his case and told him that my son is under aged (under 18) and
    should not stay with adults in the Adelabad Prison. You should send him to
    the Rehabilitation Center. However, nobody listened to me. I tried to
    relocate Mohammad and have him transferred to the Center, but nobody paid
    attention. Mr. Musavi had a weekly visitation and his parents took turns
    visiting him. (E temad Melli newspaper) Trial Mr. Musavi was tried during
    the first year of his imprisonment in the Shiraz Prison. (Farsnegar) Ms.
    Nasrin Sotudeh was his attorney. (E temad Melli newspaper) No information
    is available on his trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Musavi was
    announced as "murder." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution
    did not provide any specific information on the evidence presented against
    Mr. Musavi. According to his father, several other people had been present
    and Mr. Musavi was also beaten during the fight. However, there is no
    information about whether these witnesses had been questioned during the
    trial. Defense Mr. Musavi insisted that the killing was unintentional.
    According to his mother, in order to defend his father and reacting to the
    victim brandishing a knife, Mr. Musavi hit the victim with a knife in an
    instant. (ISNA) Mr. Musavi's mother: "I went before the judge of his case
    and told him that my son is under aged (under 18) and should not stay with
    adults in the Adelabad Prison. You should send him to the Jouvenile
    Rehabilitation Center. However, nobody listened to me." According to his
    father, on the day of the incident, Mr. Musavi had gone to see a friend to
    solve some math problems but, a few minutes later, he came back hastily,
    went to the kitchen, took a knife, and said: Kids have surrounded me and
    insulted my honor. Mr. Musavi s father went outside along with him and
    asked the kids to end the fight and go home. He took his son s hand and
    returned toward home. At this moment, the victim attacked them. His father
    described the situation as follows: I stood in front of Mohammad and said:
    He is my son. He is only 16 years old. You fought and it s done. But Hamid
    [the victim] yelled: I ll kill Mohammad," and went towards him with a
    knife. He hit his hand and when I tried to stop him, he hit my hand too.
    Mohammad became angry and held the knife up. Hamid was taller and when he
    bent over, the knife cut his throat. He fell on the ground. After this,
    Mohammad escaped and other kids began to bite me. When we went to the
    court, they [officials] told me to forget filing any complaints against
    the kids and just try to get the family s pardon. (Hamshahri newspaper) In
    defending her client, Ms. Sotudeh referred to the Article 377 of the
    Convention on the Rights of the Child and stated: After joining the
    Convention on the Rights of the Child, it is expected that Iran abolish
    death penalty against those individuals who were under 18 years old when
    committing a crime, according to the clear statement in the Article 377.
