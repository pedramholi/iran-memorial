    News of the execution of Mr. Ahad (Ahmad) Alinejad, along with two others,
    was published on the websites of IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on
    April 19, 2006, October 15 and 16, 2007, ISNA (Iranian Students News
    Agency) and Farsnama on October 15, and the Khabare Jonubnewspaper on
    October 16, 2007. Arrest and Detention According to the Head of the
    Sentence Enforcement and the Criminal Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor
    s Office in Shiraz, after two women complained about being kidnapped and
    one of them raped on November 28, 2005, the defendants were identified and
    arrested two days later. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. This trial took place in Branch Five of the Punitive
    Court of Fars. Charges The charge against Mr. Ahad (Ahmad) Alinejad, along
    with two others, was announced as "rape." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence presented against the defendant was the complaint of two
    women that one of them was raped. According to the Head of the Sentence
    Enforcement and the Criminal Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office
    in Shiraz, four members of a gang, called Amirsiah, blocked the taxi of
    these women with their vehicle and forced them to ride in their vehicle,
    threatening with a weapon. They took them to a garden near Shiraz and
    three of the men raped the young woman. After the rape, one of the gang
    members began shooting his gun to show his power in order to intimidate
    the kidnapped women and convince them not to make a complaint. Defense No
    information is available on the defendant's defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Ahad (Ahmad) Alinejad to death and the ruling was confirmed
    by Branch 32 of the Supreme Court. The defendant s request of pardon was
    rejected in the Pardon Commission of the Judiciary. He was hanged in
    public at Mo alem Square of Shiraz on October 17, 2007.
