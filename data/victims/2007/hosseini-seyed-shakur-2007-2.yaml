    News of the execution of Mr. Seyed Shakur Hosseini, along with another
    person, was published on the websites of ISNA (Iranian Students News
    Agency) on June 13, the Iran newspaper on June 14, and the E’temad and
    Jame Jam newspapers on June 13, 14, 2007. Arrest and Detention According
    to the Iran newspaper report, on September 14, 2005, the police agents of
    the Fighting against Narcotics Office in Tehran were informed of a major
    shipment of opium from Sistan and Bluchestan province to Tehran by a
    smuggling network. On September 15, the smugglers’ vehicle was identified
    in Biyabanak near Karaj and five individuals including the defendant were
    arrested after an armed clash. Trial This trial took place in Branch One
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Karaj. Charges The charges against
    Mr. Hosseini, were announced as “transportation, possession, and
    distribution of opium.” According to the Chief Judge of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Karaj, “the defendant had a record of nine previous
    convictions for participation in murder, assault and battery, and
    robbery.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the media
    reports, the defendant confessed to distribution of 2,200 kilograms of
    narcotics in Tehran. When the hiding place and the vehicle of the
    defendant were searched, 355 kilograms of impure opium, 346 kilograms of
    pure opium, 7 Kalashnikov weapons, and some bullets were recovered.
    Defense No information is available on the defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Hosseini to death as a “corruptor on earth” and the ruling
    was confirmed by the Supreme Court. His pardon request was rejected by the
    Pardon Commission. He was hanged in public in Fardis, Karaj, on June 13,
    2007. According to the E’temad newspaper, when the ruling was about to be
    carried out, two women cried and demanded to stop the execution. They were
    the sister and mother of the defendant and persistently declared that he
    was innocent. But the police took them away from the location. According
    to the Jame Jam newspaper, when he was taken to the gallows, the defendant
    continuously cried, “I’m innocent. I don’t deserve this.”
