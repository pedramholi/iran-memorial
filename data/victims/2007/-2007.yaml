date_of_death: 2007-01-01
age_at_death: null
place_of_death: "Mashhad"
province: "Khorasan-e Razavi"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    News of the execution of two unknown police officers was published on the
    websites of ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on April 2, and the
    Hambastegi newspaper on April 9, 2007, quoting the commander of the
    security forces of Khorasan Razavi province. According to the legal and
    parliamentary assistant manager of the security forces, these officers
    were the equivalent of Lieutenants or Warrant Officers. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on the defendants’ arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendants’ trial.
    Charges The charge against one of these defendants was announced as
    “participation in transportation of narcotics.” No information is
    available on the other defendant’s charges. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendants.
    Defense No information is available on the defense. Judgment These two
    defendants were condemned to death for financial corruption. No
    information is available regarding the date and location of the executions
    and it is unknown if the Supreme Court confirmed these rulings.
