    News of the execution of Mr. Abdolrasul Qorbanzadeh, along with three
    others, was published on the websites of IRNA (Islamic Republic News
    Agency), ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on September 4 and 5, 2007,
    Fars News Agency on September 5, and the Khabare-Jonub newspaper on
    September 6, 2007. Arrest and Detention According to the Khabare-Jonub
    newspaper, police were able to arrest four leaders of a narcotics gang in
    Sa adatshahr. According to the Deputy Public Prosecutor of Shiraz, these
    individuals were arrested during an armed clash with the agents in Noruz
    (on March 21) of 2005. Trial No information is available on the defendant
    s trial. This trial took place in Branch One of the Revolutionary Court of
    Shiraz. Charges The charges against Mr. Abdolrasul Qorbanzadeh were
    announced as "sedition, possession and transportation of narcotics and
    weapons, and an armed clash with officials." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt According to the Khabare-Jonub newspaper, after the
    inspection of the defendants vehicle, 462 kilograms of opium, one kilogram
    of morphine, one weapon, and several Kalashnikovs were recovered. Defence
    No information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Abdolrasul Qorbanzadeh to death and the ruling was confirmed
    by the Supreme Court. He was hanged at Darvazeh Sa di in Shiraz on
    September 5, 2007.
