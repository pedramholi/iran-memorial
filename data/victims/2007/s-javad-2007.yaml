    News of the execution of Mr. Javad S., along with three others who were
    executed in two days, was published on the websites of Fars news agency
    and the Tose’eh newspaper on June 16, 2007. He was from Rudan in the
    eastern part of Hormozgan province. Arrest and Detention According to Fars
    news agency, the agents ambushed and arrested him after intense fighting.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The trial took
    place in the Revolutionary Court of Rudan. Charges The charges against Mr.
    Javad S. were announced as “armed transportation of 15 kilograms of opium
    and unarmed transportation of 14 kilograms of opium.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defence
    No information is available on Mr. Javad’s defence. Judgment The court
    condemned this defendant to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. Mr. Javad S. was hanged in Bandar Abbas prison. The exact date of
    execution is not mentioned in the media reports.
