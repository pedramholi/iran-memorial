    News of the conviction and execution of Mr. Behruz Zanganeh, along with
    another person, was published on the websites of the weekly Paygham on
    September 16 and 17, 2006, May 27, 28, and 29, 2007, IRNA (Islamic
    Republic News Agency) on May 28, 2007, and Aria news agency on October 28,
    2007. Arrest and Detention According to the weekly Paygham, following a
    complaint made by a girl student in Bushehr claiming being kidnapped by
    three young men at woods around the village of Chahkuh and raped by seven
    young men, four of them residents of Chahkuh, security agents arrested all
    defendants except one in July of 2006. Trial This trial took place in the
    Punitive Court of Bushehr. No further information is available about the
    defendant s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Behruz Zanganeh and five
    others was collectively announced as "rape." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence presented against the defendant was announced as his
    confession and complaint made by plaintiff. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant's defense. According to the weekly Paygham,
    families of the defendants gathered in front of the Court House in Bushehr
    after the ruling was issued. During this gathering, families objected to
    the trial process and demanded to stop the ruling being carried out. They
    also gathered in front of highway police station in Bushehr and disrupted
    the traffic for awhile. Mother of a defendant, who was very excited, told
    the reporter that most of the defendants were under 18 years old. She
    rejected the allegation of rape based on the girl s statement that she
    went out of town with defendants voluntarily. She also objected to the
    court appointed attorney and quick process of ruling and execution. Sister
    of another defendant confirmed that his brother was under 18 years old and
    believed that the ruling was issued with prejudice. The families of
    defendants distributed the text of pardon by plaintiff s family among
    people, judicial authorities, and the media. Judgment The court condemned
    Mr. Behruz Zanganeh to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme
    Court. He was hanged at the Central Prison in Bushehr on October 28, 2007.
    Mr. Behruz Zanganeh was 21 years old. According to the media reports, the
    execution of these six defendants was postponed three times due to
    objection of families. Also, gatherings of families in front of government
    buildings forced authorities to carry out executions separately and in
    different times.
