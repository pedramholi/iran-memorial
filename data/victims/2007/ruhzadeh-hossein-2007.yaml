    News of the conviction and execution of Mr. Hossein Ruhzadeh, along with
    eleven others, was published on the websites of Isca news on October 12,
    2006, the Khabare-Jonub newspaper on November 15, 2006, the Iran newspaper
    on April 17, 2006, February 13, 2007, and July 22, 2007, the E temad Meli
    newspaper on June 26, the Hammihan newspaper on June 28, Fars News Agency
    on July 22, 2007, and ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on June 26, July
    4, and July 22, 2007, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office of Tehran. Mr. Ruhzadeh was a member of a gang called
    Bagh-e Khormalu (Persimmon Garden). According to reports, members of this
    gang, pretending to be taxi drivers, picked up women and girls as
    passengers and kidnapped them. They took their victims to a persimmon
    garden at Chardangeh in Karaj, stole their belongings, and raped them.
    Arrest and Detention According to the media reports, Mr. Ruhzadeh and
    seven other defendants of this case, known as Bagh-e Khormalu, were
    arrested following complaints by two young women claiming that they were
    kidnapped and raped. On January 9, 2006, a young woman filed a complaint
    in Police Station 150 in Tehransar. She accused three young men of raping
    her in a persimmon garden. While the police began to search for the
    perpetrators, another young woman made a similar complaint in Police
    Station 142 in Kan. In the light of new information, police detectives
    were able to draw a sketch of Mr. Ruhzadeh. Finally, police officers were
    able to find the defendants car on the Karaj Old Road while the passengers
    were trying to change a flat tire. They arrested the three passengers
    including Mr. Ruhzadeh. Following the confessions by these three
    individuals, five other defendants were also arrested. Trial This trial
    took place in Branch 77 of the Punitive Court of Tehran in closed
    sessions. No further information is available about Mr. Ruhzadeh s trial.
    Charges According to ISNA, quoting the General Courthouse, the charges
    against Mr. Ruhzadeh and seven other defendants of this case were
    collectively reported as "kidnapping, rape, extortion, robbery,
    intentional battery, sedition, and disrupting public security and peace."
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided against Mr. Ruhzadeh was his
    confession and the complaints by four women who testified in the court.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense Mr. Ruhzadeh only accepted robbery and kidnapping
    charges and stated in his defense that gang members only picked up women
    as passengers in West Tehran and took them to the persimmon garden. During
    the last court session, other members of the gang also confessed to
    robberies but denied kidnapping and rape charges. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Hossein Ruhzadeh to death and Branch 32 of the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in the Evin prison on July 22, 2007.
