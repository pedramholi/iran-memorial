    Mr. Abdolreza Sanavati was married and from [the city of] Ahvaz. He had an
    elementary school education and was a welder. He suffered from diabetes.
    News of Mr. Abdolreza Sanavati(Zergani) s execution was published by
    numerous sources, including the Ahwaz News Agency (January 30, 2008) and
    Amnesty International (February 7, 2008). Additional information was
    obtained from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation (ABF Inteview) with two individuals accused in the case, which
    has been referred to as the Ahvaz bombings case by Iranian authorities,
    including one of his prison mates, and one from other sources.*On February
    14, 2007, numerous sources had published the news of Mr. Sanavati s
    execution. Subsequent additional information told of the temporary delay
    in the implementation of the sentence and of Mr. Reysan Savari s execution
    instead. Mr. Abdolreza Sanavati was thrity-four years old, married, and
    from [the city of] Ahvaz. He had an elementary school education and was a
    welder. Mr. Sanavati suffered from diabetes. Mr. Sanavati was among the
    ethnic Arab citizens of Khuzestan Province who were executed in connection
    with the Ahvaz bombings of 2005-2006. The sentence and execution issued
    for this group of individuals prompted numerous reactions from the
    attorneys in the case, the Association for the Protection of Prisoners
    Rights, as well as international organizations such as Amnesty
    International (November 13, December 7, December 24, 2006 and January 25,
    2007); Human Rights Watch (November 11, 2006); The U.N. human rights
    institutions (January 10, 2007); and the European Parliament (November 16,
    2006). In a resolution issued on December 19, 2006, the UN General
    Assembly expressed grave concern about widespread human rights abuses, the
    use of torture and execution in Iran, and, more particularly, regarding
    discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities. The open
    publication of seven of the Ahvaz bombing defendants attorneys resulted in
    their prosecution on the charge of endangering national security in Ahvaz.
    (ILNA, October 7, 2006). The attorneys trial was supported by the UN
    Special Rapporteurs objections. (UN website, January 10, 2007). Historical
    Background of the Ahvaz Bombing Subsequent to the publication of a letter
    ascribed to a government official concerning systematic modification of
    the fabric of Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab population, demonstrations
    broke out on Friday, April 15, 2005, in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in
    [the town of] Hamidideh. In quashing the demonstrations, security and
    police forces resorted to violence, which led to the death and injury of
    dozens of protestors and resulted in the protests and the unrest spreading
    to a number of other Khuzestan cities, continuing for at least 10
    days.***These protests were the beginning of a series of incidents,
    including widespread arrests, multiple bombings, and successive executions
    in Ahvaz. For instance, a series of bombings followed on June 12 and
    October 15, 2005, and on January 24 and February 27, 2006, in various
    regions of Ahvaz, Abadan, and Dezful. These bombings were carried out in
    front of government buildings and in public places and left in their wake
    more than 20 dead and dozens injured.****According to government sources,
    other bombings (targeting oil pipelines and non-residential regions around
    Ahvaz) occurred at the end of summer and in the fall of 2005, which did
    not leave any casualties. In response to the Ahvaz bombings, security
    forces arrested dozens of the region s ethnic Arab individuals, charging
    them with participation in the bombings. They were then kept in solitary
    confinement cells, for months, at the Information Ministry s Detention
    Center. People being held were subjected to torture, in order to confess
    having taken part in the bombings. According to the Ahvaz Prosecutor,
    ultimately a total of four cases were opened at the Revolutionary Court,
    Special Branch, and at least 45 individuals were charged. Dozens of these
    individuals were tried in closed sessions and were sentenced to death by
    the Revolutionary Court. At least 20 of these sentences were carried out.
    Dozens of other Arab citizens were given long-term sentences. Government
    officials never accepted that these bombings had internal reasons which
    had arisen following the Khuzestan incidents. In multiple, and sometimes
    contradictory, statements, political and judicial authorities imputed
    responsibility to groups opposing [the Islamic Republic], including, Those
    loyal to the previous regime and residing in England; Fugitive SAVAK (the
    Shah s security and intelligence apparatus) members, and family members of
    the destroyed Monafeqin (MKO); Wahabis; secessionists; and/or to groups
    affiliated with the UK and other foreign countries. The Iranian government
    officially accused the UK of involvement in the bombings and declared that
    the bombers had been trained in Iraq, in regions under British army
    control, where they had acqu
