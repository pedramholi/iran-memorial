    News of the conviction and execution of Mr. Gholamreza Q. was published on
    the websites of IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on May 22, 23, 28,
    ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on May 23, and the Khabar-e Jonub
    newspaper on May 24, 2007. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial The trial took
    place in the Public and Revolutionary Court of Shiraz. No further
    information is available about the defendant s trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Gholamreza Q. were announced as, "Moharebeh (fighting) by
    participation in several armed robberies, road blocking across the Fars
    province, hostage taking, armed clashes with security forces, and creating
    fear and intimidation among the people." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense In response to a
    reporter before his execution, Mr. Gholamreza Q. took a Qoran from his
    pocket and loudly said: I was a victim of ten others misconduct. I am a
    victim . Judgment The court condemned Mr. Gholamreza Q. to death and the
    ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was hanged in public at
    Shahzadeh Qasem intersection in Shiraz on May 23, 2007.
