# --- DEATH ---
date_of_death: 2007-11-20
age_at_death: null
place_of_death: "Birjand"
province: "Khorasan-e Razavi"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    The execution of five un-named individuals was announced on the websites
    of the Fars and ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) news agencies quoting
    the News Correspondent of the South Khorasan Court on November 20, 2007.
    Arrest and Detention The circumstances of these defendants’ arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendants’ trial other than it took place in the Revolutionary Court of
    Birjand (South Khorasan province). Charges The charges against the
    defendants were announced as “purchasing, supplying, and distributing
    narcotics.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against these
    defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine, or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided
    against the defendants was announced as “recovering 110 kilograms of
    morphine, 33 kilograms of opium, 2 kilograms of heroin, and one kilogram
    and 500 grams of crystal.” Defense No information is available on the
    defense of these individuals. Judgment The court condemned these
    defendants to death and the Supreme Court and the Chief Public Prosecutor
    confirmed the ruling. Five defendants were executed in Birjand on November
    20, 2007.
