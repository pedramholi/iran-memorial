    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad Jamrasi was published on the websites
    of Fars News Agency and IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on October 31,
    and the Iran newspaper on November 1, 2007. Arrest and Detention According
    to the Iran newspaper, quoting the Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor’s
    Office of Qom, the unconscious and half dead body of a girl was taken to
    the hospital on June 24, 2007. The father of this girl made a complaint
    against a neighbor. Then, the investigator of Branch Three issued the
    arrest warrant for the neighbor and his temporary wife. He was arrested on
    June 27, 2007. Trial The trial took place in the Punitive Court of Tehran
    Province. Charges The charges against the defendant were announced as
    “acts against chastity and child molestation.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    According to the Iran newspaper, “the girl regained consciousness after
    two days and confirmed the neighbor man as the perpetrator of this crime.”
    According to the media reports, the defendant confessed to his crime
    several times in court and in front of the judges and stated, “I knew that
    my wife was going to leave the house early that day. The night before,
    therefore, I planned to bring the neighbor girl home and did according to
    my plan after my wife left.” Recovery of pictures and movies stored in his
    cell phone, in addition to having a record of previous convictions and
    addiction were also some of the evidence provided against the defendant.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. In the case of political detainees, these confessions are,
    at times, televised. The National Television broadcasts confessions during
    which prisoners plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and
    renounce their political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights
    organizations have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by
    those prisoners who are freed. Defense According to the Iran newspaper,
    “after being arrested, the defendant claimed that one his friends molested
    the girl.” Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ahmad Jamrasi to death and the
    ruling was confirmed by Branch 33 of the Supreme Court. He was hanged in
    public at the Nabovat Square in Qom on October 31, 2007.
