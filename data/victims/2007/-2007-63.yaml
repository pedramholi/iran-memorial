circumstances: >
    News of the execution of twelve unknown individuals in one week was
    published on the websites of ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) and the
    Hambastegi newspaper on August 1, 2007, quoting the Public Prosecutor of
    Karaj. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendants’ arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendants’ trial. Charges No information is available on these twelve
    defendants’ charges. The Public Prosecutor of Karaj referred to them
    collectively as “hooligans”. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendants. Defense No information is available on their
    defense. Judgment These defendants were hanged in public in the last week
    of July, 2007.
