    News of the execution of Mr. Ezzat Sarani, along with sixteen others, was
    published on the websites of Taftan News Agency and the Baluchestan
    People’s Party on December 26, 2007. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge
    against Mr. Sarani was announced as “murder." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment According to the Taftan News Agency,
    the plaintiff of this case pardoned him, but without taking this into
    consideration, Mr. Ezzat Sarani was hanged in the Zahedan Central Prison
    on December 25, 2007.
