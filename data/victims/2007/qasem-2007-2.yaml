    News of the execution of Mr. Qasem, from Kohnuj, along with three others
    who were executed in two days, was published on the websites of the Fars
    news agency and the Tose eh newspaper on June 16, 2007. Arrest and
    Detention According to the media reports and record of his case, Mr.
    Qasem, along with another person, was transporting narcotics in a Peykan
    car on December 20, 2005, when the Faryab Station police officers
    suspected them. They did not obey the police order to stop and kept
    driving. However, they were arrested after an intensive clash with the
    police. Trial This trial took place in the Revolutionary Court of Rudan.
    No further information is available on Mr. Qasem s trial. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Qasem was announced as "armed transportation of 154
    kilograms of opium." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    Mr. Qasem cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Qasem. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Qasem 's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Qasem to death and the
    confiscation of his belongings and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme
    Court. Mr. Qasem was hanged in Bandar Abbas prison on June 13, 2007. He
    was 24 years old.
