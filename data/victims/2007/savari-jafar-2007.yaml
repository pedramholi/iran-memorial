    Mr. Savari was a building electrician and was preparing to continue his
    education at the college level. One of his dreams was to have a car. News
    of Mr. Ja far Savari s execution was published in numerous sources,
    including Amnesty International (September 13, 2007), Ahvaz Human Rights
    Organization (September 14, 2007), and Radio Farda (September 13, 2007).
    Quoting the Ahvaz prosecutor, the IRNA and ISNA news agencies published
    news of the execution of three individuals (September 13, 2007), without
    mention of their names. Additional information regarding this case was
    obtained from an interview by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with a
    person close to Mr. Savari and with two other individuals accused in the
    Ahvaz unrests, including a prison mate ( ABF Interview ) and from other
    sources.* Jafar Savari was a 23-year-old high school graduate, who resided
    in the city of Ahvaz. He was a Sunni Arab from Dashte Azadegan who grew up
    in a poor, war-torn family under very difficult conditions. He was an
    independent young man, funny, kind, and studious. He was a humanitarian
    and had many friends. Mr. Savari was a building electrician and was
    preparing to continue his education at the college level. One of his
    dreams was to have a car. (ABF Interview). Mr. Savari and his brother,
    Mohammad Ali Savari, along with Abdolreza Navaseri, were the fifth group
    of Khuzestan Province ethnic Arabs who were executed in Ahvaz, in
    connection with the 2005 bombings and unrest. The sentence and execution
    issued for this group of individuals prompted numerous reactions from the
    attorneys in the case, the Association for the Protection of Prisoners
    Rights, as well as international organizations such as Amnesty
    International (May 17 and June 29, 2006) and Human Rights Watch (June 26
    and November 11, 2006). In a resolution issued on December 19, 2006, the
    UN General Assembly expressed grave concern about widespread human rights
    abuses, the use of torture and execution in Iran, and, more particularly,
    regarding discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities. The open
    publication of seven of the Ahvaz bombing defendants attorneys resulted in
    their prosecution on the charge of endangering national security in Ahvaz.
    (ILNA, October 7, 2006). The attorneys trial was supported by the UN
    Special Rapporteurs objections. (UN website, January 10, 2007). Historical
    Background of the Ahvaz Bombing Subsequent to the publication of a letter
    ascribed to a government official concerning systematic modification of
    the fabric of Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab population, demonstrations
    broke out on Friday, April 15, 2005, in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in
    [the town of] Hamidideh. In quashing the demonstrations, security and
    police forces resorted to violence, which led to the death and injury of
    dozens of protestors and resulted in the protests and the unrest spreading
    to a number of other Khuzestan cities, continuing for at least 10
    days.**These protests were the beginning of a series of incidents,
    including widespread arrests, multiple bombings, and successive executions
    in Ahvaz. For instance, a series of bombings followed on June 12 and
    October 15, 2005, and on January 24 and February 27, 2006, in various
    regions of Ahvaz, Abadan, and Dezful. These bombings were carried out in
    front of government buildings and in public places and left in their wake
    more than 20 dead and dozens injured.***According to government sources,
    other bombings (targeting oil pipelines and non-residential regions around
    Ahvaz) occurred at the end of summer and in the fall of 2005, which did
    not leave any casualties. In response to the Ahvaz bombings, security
    forces arrested dozens of the region s ethnic Arab individuals, charging
    them with participation in the bombings. They were then kept in solitary
    confinement cells, for months, at the Information Ministry s Detention
    Center. People being held were subjected to torture, in order to confess
    having taken part in the bombings. According to the Ahvaz Prosecutor,
    ultimately a total of four cases were opened at the Revolutionary Court,
    Special Branch, and at least 45 individuals were charged. Dozens of these
    individuals were tried in closed sessions and were sentenced to death by
    the Revolutionary Court. At least 20 of these sentences were carried out.
    Dozens of other Arab citizens were given long-term sentences. Government
    officials never accepted that these bombings had internal reasons which
    had arisen following the Khuzestan incidents. In multiple, and sometimes
    contradictory, statements, political and judicial authorities imputed
    responsibility to groups opposing [the Islamic Republic], including, Those
    loyal to the previous regime and residing in England; Fugitive SAVAK (the
    Shah s security and intelligence apparatus) members, and family members of
    the destroyed Monafeqin (MKO); Wahabis; secessionists; and/or to groups
    affiliated with the UK and other foreign countries. The Iranian government
