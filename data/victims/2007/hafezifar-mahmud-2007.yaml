    News of the execution of Mr. Mahmud Hafezifar along with sixteen others
    was published on the websites of the Aftab-e-Yazd and Iran newspaper on
    September 6, ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on September 7, 2007, and
    the website of Iranian human rights activists in Europe and North America
    in September 2007, quoting the Head of the Public Relations Office of the
    Khorasan Razavi Prisons Office. In its announcement on September 5, 2007,
    Amnesty International was appalled at the reports of these executions in
    the Islamic Republic and demanded they be stopped. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on Mr. Hafezifar s arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Hafezifar s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Hafezifar were announced as narcotics related . The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of these
    executions does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Hafezifar. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Hafezifar s defense. Judgment The court announced Mr. Hafezifar to be a
    corruptor on the earth and sentenced her to death. (Aftab-e-Yazd) He was
    hanged in the Mashhad central prison onSeptember 5, 2007at dawn.
