    News of the conviction and execution of one unknown individual along with
    four others was published on the ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency),
    Kayhan Newspaper websites on May 21, and the Police Information Base on
    June 3, 2007. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant s arrests and detention. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges The charge against these defendant was
    announced as "rape." According to the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor
    of Jiroft, six individuals raped a woman, who was accompanied by her
    husband, on the hills near the village of Marun, Jiroft, in early 2007.
    One of the-couple was able to escape. According to the Police Information
    Base, these defendants had previous records of sedition, rascal behavior,
    and rape. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant and four others cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant s defense. Judgment The court condemned this defendant and
    four others to death and the rulings were confirmed by Branch 28 of the
    Supreme Court. This defendant along with four others were hanged in public
    in Jiroft on June 2, 2007.
