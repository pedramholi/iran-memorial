quotes:
  - "I loved Raziyeh and wanted to marry her. But her family opposed this. I fell in love with her when she was my sister’s classmate four years ago. After four years of persistence, when they still refused me, I had to go to their house or call them to stop refusing me. After a while, Raziyeh’s family made a complaint against me. But, after I was released from the prison, I asked them again to let us get married. I couldn’t tolerate to see her marry another guy. Raziyeh’s love was so strong in me that I felt I cannot live without her but her family was against it and there was no way I could marry her. I thought since Raziyeh would not be my wife, it’d be better if she was not alive."

    News of the execution of Mr. Sadeq M. was published on the websites of
    ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on October 24, IRNA (Islamic Republic
    News Agency) on May 19 and October 25, and Khabare Jonub on April 22,
    October 23, and October 25, 2007. Arrest and Detention On April 7, 2007, a
    sixteen year old girl was killed by blows of a knife in Sahlabad, Shiraz.
    After investigation and gathering information from the victim’s family,
    the police detectives of Shiraz identified and arrested the defendant.
    Trial This trial took place in Branch Two of the Provincial Penal Court in
    four sessions beginning on April 19, 2007. Charges The charge against Mr.
    Sadeq M. was announced as “murder.” According to the media reports, “the
    defendant murdered his beloved girl when faced with the opposition of her
    family to their marriage.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided
    against the defendant was his confession and the testimony of the victim’s
    mother who was present at the time of committing the crime. International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the
    case of political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised.
    The National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners
    plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their
    political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations
    have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those
    prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available on the
    defendant’s defense. According to the Khabare Jonub report, the defendant
    confessed during his interrogation saying, “I loved Raziyeh and wanted to
    marry her. But her family opposed this. I fell in love with her when she
    was my sister’s classmate four years ago. After four years of persistence,
    when they still refused me, I had to go to their house or call them to
    stop refusing me. After a while, Raziyeh’s family made a complaint against
    me. But, after I was released from the prison, I asked them again to let
    us get married. I couldn’t tolerate to see her marry another guy.
    Raziyeh’s love was so strong in me that I felt I cannot live without her
    but her family was against it and there was no way I could marry her. I
    thought since Raziyeh would not be my wife, it’d be better if she was not
    alive.” Judgment The court condemned Mr. Sadeq M. to death and the ruling
    was confirmed by Branch 37 of the Supreme Court after 28 days. According
    to the Khabare Jonub report, there was a period of delay between the
    confirmation of the ruling by the Supreme Court and its being carried out
    due to the issue of paying the difference amount of blood money.* The
    defendant was hanged in public at the location of the incident in Shiraz
    on October 24, 2007. * In the Iranian Penal Code, murder is punishable by
    execution (retribution), giving the family of the victim the right to
    consent to the execution sentence or forgive the perpetrator. At the same
    time, the blood money of a woman is half that of a man. Consequently, if
    the family of a female victim decides to uphold the death sentence of the
    male perpetrator, the victim’s family must pay half of the blood money of
    the male perpetrator to his family.
