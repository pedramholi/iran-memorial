    Was single, and a resident of Mahshahr in the south of Khuzestan Province.
    He was a worker at [the town of] Bandar Imam Khomeini s Petrochemical
    Company. News of Mr. Alireza Asakereh execution was published by numerous
    sources, including Ahwaz News Agency (January 24, 2007), Advar News
    (January 25, 2007), Radio Farda, and Amnesty International (January 24,
    2007). Quoting the Office of Public Relations of Khuzestan Province s
    Judiciary, ISNA and Fars News Agency published the news of the execution
    of four unidentified individuals in Ahvaz. Additional information was
    obtained from an interview, conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation, with two individuals accused in the Ahvaz bombing case
    (Foundation interview), including one of his prison mates, and from other
    sources.* Mr. Asakereh was 28 years old, single, and a resident of
    Mahshahr in the south of Khuzestan Province. He was a worker at [the town
    of] Bandar Imam Khomeini s Petrochemical Company. Mr.Asakereh, along with
    three others, made up the third group of Khuzestani Arabs who were
    executed in connection with the 2005-2006 unrest and bombings. The
    issuance of a death sentence for this group of defendants caused strong
    reactions from the attorneys in the case, from the Organization for the
    Defense of Prisoners Rights, and from international organizations such as
    Amnesty International (November 13 and December 24, 2006); Human Rights
    Watch (November 11, 2006); The U.N. human rights institutions (January 10,
    2007); and the European Parliament (November 16, 2006). By issuing a
    resolution on December 19, 2006, the U.N. General Assembly had expressed
    its grave concern regarding the widespread breach of human rights as well
    as the use of torture and execution, especially discrimination against
    ethnic and religious minorities, in Iran. The publication of seven of the
    defense attorneys objections resulted in the latter being summoned by
    Branch 7 of the Ahvaz Prosecutor s Office, for endangering national
    security. The defense attorneys trial was followed by the U.N. Special
    Rapporteurs objections (U.N. website, November 11, 2006). Historical
    Background of the Ahvaz Bombing Subsequent to the publication of a letter
    ascribed to a government official concerning systematic modification of
    the fabric of Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab population, demonstrations
    broke out on Friday, April 15, 2005, in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in
    [the town of] Hamidideh. In quashing the demonstrations, security and
    police forces resorted to violence, which led to the death and injury of
    dozens of protestors and resulted in the protests and the unrest spreading
    to a number of other Khuzestan cities, continuing for at least 10 days.**
    These protests were the beginning of a series of incidents, including
    widespread arrests, multiple bombings, and successive executions in Ahvaz.
    For instance, a series of bombings followed on June 12 and October 15,
    2005, and on January 24 and February 27, 2006, in various regions of
    Ahvaz, Abadan, and Dezful. These bombings were carried out in front of
    government buildings and in public places and left in their wake more than
    20 dead and dozens injured.*** According to government sources, other
    bombings (targeting oil pipelines and non-residential regions around
    Ahvaz) occurred at the end of summer and in the fall of 2005, which did
    not leave any casualties. In response to the Ahvaz bombings, security
    forces arrested dozens of the region s ethnic Arab individuals, charging
    them with participation in the bombings. They were then kept in solitary
    confinement cells, for months, at the Information Ministry s Detention
    Center. People being held were subjected to torture, in order to confess
    having taken part in the bombings. According to the Ahvaz Prosecutor,
    ultimately a total of four cases were opened at the Revolutionary Court,
    Special Branch, and at least 45 individuals were charged. Dozens of these
    individuals were tried in closed sessions and were sentenced to death by
    the Revolutionary Court. At least 19 of these sentences were carried out.
    Dozens of other Arab citizens were given long-term sentences. Government
    officials never accepted that these bombings had internal reasons which
    had arisen following the Khuzestan incidents. In multiple, and sometimes
    contradictory, statements, political and judicial authorities imputed
    responsibility to groups opposing [the Islamic Republic], including, Those
    loyal to the previous regime and residing in England; Fugitive SAVAK (the
    Shah s security and intelligence apparatus) members, and family members of
    the destroyed Monafeqin (MKO); Wahabis; secessionists; and/or to groups
    affiliated with the UK and other foreign countries. The Iranian government
    officially accused the UK of involvement in the bombings and declared that
    the bombers had been trained in Iraq, in regions under British army
    control, where they had acquired their arms and explosives. In one such
    statement, then-President Mahmud Ahmadinej
