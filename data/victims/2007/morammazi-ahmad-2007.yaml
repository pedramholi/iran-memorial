    Mr. Morammazi was married and had two children. He resided in the town of
    Sarbandar, in the South of Khuzestan Province. News of Mr. Ahmad Morammazi
    s execution was published by numerous sources, including: Amnesty
    International (February 7, 2008); the Ahvaz Human Rights Organization
    (January 30, 2008); and the Ahvaz Democratic Popular Front (January 3,
    2008). Additional information was obtained from an interview conducted by
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with two individuals accused in the
    case, which has been referred to as the Ahvaz bombings case by Iranian
    authorities, including a prison mate, as well as other sources.* Mr.
    Morammazi was 35-years-old, married, and had two children. He resided in
    the town of Sarbandar, in the South of Khuzestan Province, and had a
    middle school education. Mr. Morammazi along with Abdolhossein Horaibi and
    Hossein Asakereh, were the sixth group of Khuzestan Province ethnic Arabs
    who were executed in Ahvaz, in connection with the 2005 bombings and
    unrest.The sentence and execution issued for this group of individuals
    prompted numerous reactions from The U.N. human rights institutions; the
    European Parliament; Amnesty International (October 18, and December 7,
    2007); and the Ahwaz Human Rights Organisation (November 5, 2007, and
    January 2, 2008). In a resolution issued on December 19, 2006, the UN
    General Assembly expressed grave concern about widespread human rights
    abuses, the use of torture and execution in Iran, and, more particularly,
    regarding discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities. The open
    publication of seven of the Ahvaz bombing defendants attorneys resulted in
    their prosecution on the charge of endangering national security in Ahvaz.
    (ILNA, October 7, 2006). The attorneys trial was supported by the UN
    Special Rapporteurs objections. (UN website, January 10, 2007). On January
    22, 2008, the European Parliament strongly condemned the execution of four
    Arab political activists, including Mr. Morammazi. Historical Background
    of the Ahvaz Bombing Subsequent to the publication of a letter ascribed to
    a government official concerning systematic modification of the fabric of
    Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab population, demonstrations broke out on
    Friday, April 15, 2005, in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in [the town of]
    Hamidideh. In quashing the demonstrations, security and police forces
    resorted to violence, which led to the death and injury of dozens of
    protestors and resulted in the protests and the unrest spreading to a
    number of other Khuzestan cities, continuing for at least 10 days.**These
    protests were the beginning of a series of incidents, including widespread
    arrests, multiple bombings, and successive executions in Ahvaz. For
    instance, a series of bombings followed on June 12 and October 15, 2005,
    and on January 24 and February 27, 2006, in various regions of Ahvaz,
    Abadan, and Dezful. These bombings were carried out in front of government
    buildings and in public places and left in their wake more than 20 dead
    and dozens injured.***According to government sources, other bombings
    (targeting oil pipelines and non-residential regions around Ahvaz)
    occurred at the end of summer and in the fall of 2005, which did not leave
    any casualties. In response to the Ahvaz bombings, security forces
    arrested dozens of the region s ethnic Arab individuals, charging them
    with participation in the bombings. They were then kept in solitary
    confinement cells, for months, at the Information Ministry s Detention
    Center. People being held were subjected to torture, in order to confess
    having taken part in the bombings. According to the Ahvaz Prosecutor,
    ultimately a total of four cases were opened at the Revolutionary Court,
    Special Branch, and at least 45 individuals were charged. Dozens of these
    individuals were tried in closed sessions and were sentenced to death by
    the Revolutionary Court. At least 20 of these sentences were carried out.
    Dozens of other Arab citizens were given long-term sentences. Government
    officials never accepted that these bombings had internal reasons which
    had arisen following the Khuzestan incidents. In multiple, and sometimes
    contradictory, statements, political and judicial authorities imputed
    responsibility to groups opposing [the Islamic Republic], including, Those
    loyal to the previous regime and residing in England; Fugitive SAVAK (the
    Shah s security and intelligence apparatus) members, and family members of
    the destroyed Monafeqin (MKO); Wahabis; secessionists; and/or to groups
    affiliated with the UK and other foreign countries. The Iranian government
    officially accused the UK of involvement in the bombings and declared that
    the bombers had been trained in Iraq, in regions under British army
    control, where they had acquired their arms and explosives. In one such
    statement, then-President Mahmud Ahmadinejad spoke of the clear and
    obvious footprint of Iraq s occupiers in the Khuzestan incidents. ( ISNA ,
    January 25, 2006). The B
