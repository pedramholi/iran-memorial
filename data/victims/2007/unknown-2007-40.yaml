    News of the execution of one unknown Afghan and one other, who were under
    18 years old at the time of the alleged crime, was published on the
    website of BBC Persian on October 8, 2007 and the Afghanistan Independent
    Human Rights Commission on October 20, 2007. International laws have
    strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the
    age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the
    Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence
    committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendants arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendants trial. Charges The charge
    against these defendants was announced as "smuggling narcotics." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendants. Defense No information is available on
    the defendants defense. Judgment No specific information is available
    about the defendants execution. According to the BBC, these two
    individuals were executed in 2007. According to the Afghanistan
    Independent Human Rights Commission, the families of these children must
    pay 330 thousand Rials if they want the bodies of their sons returned to
    Afghanistan.
