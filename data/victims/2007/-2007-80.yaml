circumstances: >
    News of the execution of seventeen individuals, sixteen of them unknown,
    was published on the websites of Taftan News Agency and Baluchestan
    People’s Party on December 26, 2007. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendants’ arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendants’ trial. Charges According to
    the reporter of Taftan in Zahedan, these 17 defendants were collectively
    charged with “sedition, dealing narcotics, creating traffic, and murder.”
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against these defendants
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year
    Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of theses executions does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendants. Defense No information is available on the defense. Judgment
    No specific information is available about the defendants’ execution.
    These defendants were hanged in the Zahedan Central Prison on December 25,
    2007.
