    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Khashi, along with another person, was
    published on the websites of the Fars news agency on May 22 and the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on May 24, 2007 quoting the Public Relations
    Office of the Sistan and Baluchestan Provincial Court. Arrest and
    Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The
    trial took place in the Revolutionary Court of Iranshahr (Sistan and
    Baluchestan province). Charges The charge against Mr. Ali Khashi was
    announced as "dealing narcotics, such as heroin." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Khashi's defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Ali Khashi to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged in the Iranshahr prison yard on May 21, 2007.
