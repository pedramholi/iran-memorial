    News of the execution of Mr. Abdolsamad (Abdollah) Kajkush was published
    on the websites of IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on August 8 and the
    News Base of the Islamic Republic Security Forces on August 12, 2007.
    Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s
    arrest and detention. Trial This trial took place in Branch Two of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Iranshahr. No further information is
    available about Mr. Kajkush s trial. Charges The charges against Mr.
    Abdolsamad (Abdollah) Kajkush were announced as "possession of 23
    kilograms and 300 grams of morphine, 35 kilograms of opium, and a Colt
    handgun with bullets," according to IRNA, and possession of 22 kilograms
    and 300 grams of heroin, 35 kilograms of opium, and carrying a Colt
    handgun, according to the News Base of the Islamic Republic Security
    Forces. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Kajkush. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Kajkush's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Abdolsamad (Abdollah)
    Kajkush to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was
    hanged in the Iranshahr prison yard on August 8 or 12, 2007.
