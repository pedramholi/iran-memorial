    News of Mr. Khalaf Khaziravi s (Khazra i) execution was published by
    numerous sources, including Ahwaz News Agency (January 24, 2007), Advar
    News (January 25, 2007), Radio Farda, and Amnesty International (January
    24, 2007). Quoting the Office of Public Relations of Khuzestan Province s
    Judiciary, ISNA and Fars News Agency published the news of the execution
    of four unidentified individuals in Ahvaz. Additional information was
    obtained from an interview, conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation, with two individuals accused in the Ahvaz bombing case
    (Foundation interview), including one of his prison mates, and from other
    sources.* Mr. Khaziravi was 40 years old, married, with one child, and was
    from Shadegan (Fallahieh). Mr.Khaziravi, along with three others, made up
    the third group of Khuzestani Arabs who were executed in connection with
    the 2005-2006 unrest and bombings. The issuance of a death sentence for
    this group of defendants caused strong reactions from the attorneys in the
    case, from the Organization for the Defense of Prisoners Rights, and from
    international organizations such as Amnesty International (November 13 and
    December 24, 2006); Human Rights Watch (November 11, 2006); The U.N. human
    rights institutions (January 10, 2007); and the European Parliament
    (November 16, 2006). By issuing a resolution on December 19, 2006, the
    U.N. General Assembly had expressed its grave concern regarding the
    widespread breach of human rights as well as the use of torture and
    execution, especially discrimination against ethnic and religious
    minorities, in Iran. The publication of seven of the defense attorneys
    objections resulted in the latter being summoned by Branch 7 of the Ahvaz
    Prosecutor s Office, for endangering national security. The defense
    attorneys trial was followed by the U.N. Special Rapporteurs objections
    (U.N. website, November 11, 2006). Historical Background of the Ahvaz
    Bombing Subsequent to the publication of a letter ascribed to a government
    official concerning systematic modification of the fabric of Khuzestan
    Province s ethnic Arab population, demonstrations broke out on Friday,
    April 15, 2005, in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in [the town of]
    Hamidideh. In quashing the demonstrations, security and police forces
    resorted to violence, which led to the death and injury of dozens of
    protestors and resulted in the protests and the unrest spreading to a
    number of other Khuzestan cities, continuing for at least 10 days.** These
    protests were the beginning of a series of incidents, including widespread
    arrests, multiple bombings, and successive executions in Ahvaz. For
    instance, a series of bombings followed on June 12 and October 15, 2005,
    and on January 24 and February 27, 2006, in various regions of Ahvaz,
    Abadan, and Dezful. These bombings were carried out in front of government
    buildings and in public places and left in their wake more than 20 dead
    and dozens injured.*** According to government sources, other bombings
    (targeting oil pipelines and non-residential regions around Ahvaz)
    occurred at the end of summer and in the fall of 2005, which did not leave
    any casualties. In response to the Ahvaz bombings, security forces
    arrested dozens of the region s ethnic Arab individuals, charging them
    with participation in the bombings. They were then kept in solitary
    confinement cells, for months, at the Information Ministry s Detention
    Center. People being held were subjected to torture, in order to confess
    having taken part in the bombings. According to the Ahvaz Prosecutor,
    ultimately a total of four cases were opened at the Revolutionary Court,
    Special Branch, and at least 45 individuals were charged. Dozens of these
    individuals were tried in closed sessions and were sentenced to death by
    the Revolutionary Court. At least 19 of these sentences were carried out.
    Dozens of other Arab citizens were given long-term sentences. Government
    officials never accepted that these bombings had internal reasons which
    had arisen following the Khuzestan incidents. In multiple, and sometimes
    contradictory, statements, political and judicial authorities imputed
    responsibility to groups opposing [the Islamic Republic], including, Those
    loyal to the previous regime and residing in England; Fugitive SAVAK (the
    Shah s security and intelligence apparatus) members, and family members of
    the destroyed Monafeqin (MKO); Wahabis; secessionists; and/or to groups
    affiliated with the UK and other foreign countries. The Iranian government
    officially accused the UK of involvement in the bombings and declared that
    the bombers had been trained in Iraq, in regions under British army
    control, where they had acquired their arms and explosives. In one such
    statement, then-President Mahmud Ahmadinejad spoke of the clear and
    obvious footprint of Iraq s occupiers in the Khuzestan incidents. (ISNA,
    January 25, 2006). The British government officially denied these
    accusations and expressed its concern regarding such statements
