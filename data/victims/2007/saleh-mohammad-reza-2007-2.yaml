    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Saleh, along with another
    person, was published on the websites of Fars News Agency and Isca news on
    December 17, 2007, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Systan and
    Baluchestan Provincial Court and the Islamic Public and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor's Office in Zahedan. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on Mr. Saleh s arrest and detention. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Saleh s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Saleh were
    announced as "dealing, transporting, and possession of narcotics
    continuously". The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Saleh. Defense No information is available on Mr. Saleh's
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad Reza Saleh to death and
    the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Judiciary Officials. He was hanged
    in the Zahedan prison yard on December 17, 2007.
