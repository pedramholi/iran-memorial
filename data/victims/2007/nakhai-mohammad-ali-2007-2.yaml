    News of the conviction and execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Nakha i, son of
    Morteza, along with five others, was published on the websites of Fars
    news agency on May 7, ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) and Kerna on May
    8, 2007, quoting the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Kerman.
    According to the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Kerman, Mr. Nakha
    i was a member of a smuggling gang in the northern heights of Kerman who
    transported narcotics from Afghanistan and distributed within the
    province. Arrest and Detention In September of 2006, anti-narcotics
    security forces in Nasr Base were informed about the activities of this
    gang and a while after, identified and arrested them. Trial No information
    is available on Mr. Nakha i s trial. Charges The charge against Mr.
    Mohammad Ali Nakha i was announced as "smuggling narcotics." The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the media
    reports, the evidence provided against these defendants was their
    confession, recovery of 140 kilograms of opium from his house, and
    recovery of 130 kilograms of narcotics, several weapons, ammunition, and
    several cameras from their base on the northern elevation of Kerman.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. In the case of political detainees, these confessions are,
    at times, televised. The National Television broadcasts confessions during
    which prisoners plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and
    renounce their political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights
    organizations have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by
    those prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available about
    Mr. Nakha i 's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad Ali
    Nakha i to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was
    hanged in public in Ravar, Kerman, on May 8, 2007.
