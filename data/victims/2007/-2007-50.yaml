# --- DEATH ---
date_of_death: 2007-03-15
age_at_death: null
place_of_death: "Zahedan"
province: "Sistan Va Baluchestan"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    News of the execution of two unknown individuals was published on the
    website of the Khabar Network on March 15, 2007, quoting the Public
    Relations Office of the Sistan and Baluchestan Provincial Court. Arrest
    and Detention There is no specific information on the defendants’ arrest
    and detention. Trial No information is available on the defendants’ trial.
    Charges The charge against the defendants was announced as “smuggling
    narcotics such as heroin.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of these executions does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendants. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment According to Khabar Network, the court
    condemned these defendants to death, and after the supreme judiciary
    officials confirmed the ruling, they were executed in the Zahedan Central
    prison on March 15, 2007.
