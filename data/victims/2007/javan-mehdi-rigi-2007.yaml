    News of the execution of Mr. Mehdi Rigi Javan, along with another person,
    was published on the websites of the Fars and IRNA (Islamic Republic News
    Agency) news agencies on December 31, 2007. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to the Revolutionary Public Prosecution Office, the charges
    against Mr. Mehdi Rigi Javan were announced as “purchasing, carrying, and
    possession of 59 kilograms of heroin.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Rigi Javan’s defense. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Mehdi Rigi Javan to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in the Zahedan prison yard on December
    31, 2007. Regarding this execution the Sistan and Baluchestan Court
    announced: “The judiciary acts decisively to deal with death dealers,
    seditious groups, and disruptors of security.”
