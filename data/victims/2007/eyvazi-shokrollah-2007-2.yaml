    News of the execution of Mr. Shokrollah Eyvazi, a resident of Shirkesh
    village near Bijar, was published on the website of the Human Rights
    Organization of Kurdistan on January 29, 2007. Arrest and Detention There
    is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial
    No information is available on Mr. Eyvazi s trial. Charges The charge
    against Mr. Eyvazi was announced as "murder." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Eyvazi. Defense According to the Human
    Rights Organization of Kurdistan report, the defendant was a village
    farmer charged with the murder of his fellow villager. It has been said
    that he denied any participation in the murder and pleaded not guilty
    until the last moment of his life. Judgment No specific information is
    available about Shokrollah Eyvazi s execution. According to the Human
    Rights Organization of Kurdistan report, Mr. Shokrollah Eyvazi was hanged
    at the Central Prison of Sanandaj in February of 2007. No specific date is
    available for the defendant s execution.
