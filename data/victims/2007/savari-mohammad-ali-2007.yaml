    Mr. Savari established the Imam Ali Fund, a youth NGO in Ahvaz s Kut
    Abdollah region. Giving small loans to vulnerable individuals and
    conducting Arabic language, Koran, and tutorial classes for poor students,
    were among this NGO s activities. News of Mr. Mohammad Ali Savari s
    execution was published in numerous sources, including Amnesty
    International (September 13, 2007), Ahvaz Human Rights Organization
    (September 14, 2007), and Radio Farda (September 13, 2007). Quoting the
    Ahvaz prosecutor, the IRNA and ISNA news agencies published news of the
    execution of three individuals (September 13, 2007), without mention of
    their names. Additional information in this regard was obtained in an
    interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF), with a
    person close to Mr. Savari, and with two individuals accused in the case,
    which has been referred to as the Ahvaz bombings case by Iranian
    authorities, including a prison mate (ABF interview), as well as from Mr.
    Savari s complaint addressing the Revolutionary Court, the Judges
    Disciplinary Court, the letter sent by seven attorneys to the head of the
    Ahvaz Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal Branch 3, and from other sources*.
    Mr. Mohammad Ali Savari was 38-years-old, was married, and had five
    children. He had a bachelor s degree in English Literature and was an
    English teacher in the city of Ahvaz. In addition to teaching, he worked
    part-time as a driver in a taxicab agency. He was an ethnic Sunni Arab
    from Dashte Azadegan who had grown up in a war-torn and poor family, in
    very difficult circumstances. Mr. Savari was a calm man, an avid reader,
    intellectual, humanitarian, and a cultural and social activist in Ahvaz.
    He was among the first members of Lajanah Al Wefaq, **from which he
    separated when it became the Vefaq Party and continued his cultural
    activities in the NGO Shams-e Jonub. He later established the Imam Ali
    Fund, a youth NGO in Ahvaz s Kut Abdollah region. Giving small loans to
    vulnerable individuals, publishing the internal publication Al-Resalah ,
    and conducting Arabic language classes, as well as Koran, theater, and
    tutorial classes for poor students, were among this NGO s activities. (ABF
    interview). He staged a play in Arabic in Ahvaz, having to do with
    Palestine. He was also trying to produce and stage the Arabic translation
    of Orwell s Animal Farm. Along with other ethnic Arab activists of Ahvaz,
    he organized popular demonstrations on the occasion of Quds Day 2004, in
    support of Palestine, which were carried out parallel with the
    government-organized demonstrations, resulting in the security forces
    reactions and threats. These demonstrations were completely Arabic in form
    and were accompanied by popular and Arabic slogans. (ABF Interview).
    According to one of his prison mates, Mr. Savari clearly stated that he
    did not believe in violence at all, but in peaceful struggle. A short time
    after Mr. Savari s arrest, his wife and children, who lived in one of the
    Ahvaz schools custodial lodgings, were evicted by the Ministry of
    Education. (ABF Interview). Mr. Savari and his brother, Jafar Savari,
    along with Abdolreza Navaseri, were the fifth group of Khuzestan Province
    ethnic Arabs who were executed in Ahvaz, in connection with the 2005
    bombings and unrest. The sentence and execution issued for this group of
    individuals prompted numerous reactions from the attorneys in the case,
    the Association for the Protection of Prisoners Rights, as well as
    international organizations such as Amnesty International (May 17 and June
    29, 2006) and Human Rights Watch (June 26 and November 11, 2006). In a
    resolution issued on December 19, 2006, the UN General Assembly expressed
    grave concern about widespread human rights abuses, the use of torture and
    execution in Iran, and, more particularly, regarding discrimination
    against ethnic and religious minorities. The open publication of seven of
    the Ahvaz bombing defendants attorneys resulted in their prosecution on
    the charge of endangering national security in Ahvaz. (ILNA, October 7,
    2006). The attorneys trial was supported by the UN Special Rapporteurs
    objections. (UN website, January 10, 2007). Historical Background of the
    Ahvaz Bombing Subsequent to the publication of a letter ascribed to a
    government official concerning systematic modification of the fabric of
    Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab population, demonstrations broke out on
    Friday, April 15, 2005, in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in [the town of]
    Hamidideh. In quashing the demonstrations, security and police forces
    resorted to violence, which led to the death and injury of dozens of
    protestors and resulted in the protests and the unrest spreading to a
    number of other Khuzestan cities, continuing for at least 10 days.***
    These protests were the beginning of a series of incidents, including
    widespread arrests, multiple bombings, and successive executions in Ahvaz.
    For instance, a series of bombings followed on June 12 and October 15,
    2005, and on January 2
