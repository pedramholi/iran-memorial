circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. M. H., along with another person, was
    published on the websites of Fars News Agency on January 14, and the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on January 15, 2007, quoting the Public Relations
    Office of the Khuzestan Provincial Court. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge
    against Mr. M. H. was announced as “two counts of armed robbery and being
    at war with God.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The court condemned this defendant to death and the ruling was
    confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was hanged in the Karun prison in
    Ahvaz. No specific date is available about the defendant’s execution.
