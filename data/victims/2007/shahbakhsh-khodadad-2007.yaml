circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Khodadad Shahbakhsh, along with another
    person, was published on the websites of Fars News Agency and Iscanews on
    December 17, 2007, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Systan and
    Baluchestan Provincial Court and the Islamic Public and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor's Office in Zahedan. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on Mr. Shahbakhsh s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available about Mr. Shahbakhsh s trial. Charges The charges against Mr.
    Khodadad Shahbakhsh were announced as "Moharebeh (fighting) and corruption
    by participating in banditry and armed robbery." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Khodadad Shahbakhsh to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme
    Judiciary Officials. He was hanged in the Zahedan prison yard on December
    17, 2007.
