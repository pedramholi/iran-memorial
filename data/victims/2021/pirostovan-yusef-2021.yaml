    News and information regarding the execution of Mr Yusef Pirostovan and
    his former wife was published by the Human Rights Organization of Iran, on
    May 31, 2021. Mr. Pirostovan s case was related to drug offenses. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Pirostovan and his wife were arrested while driving on
    the Qazvin Karaj Freeway, in 2014-2015. The exact time and circumstances
    of his arrest are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Pirostovan s trial or trials. Charges The charge brought against Mr.
    Pirostovan and his former wife was transporting 380 kilograms of narcotics
    . There is no information about the details of the charge or charges
    brought against him. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against Mr. Pirostovan. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Pirostovan s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr.
    Yusef Pirostovan to death. He and his former wife were executed in Qazvin
    Central Prison (Choubin Dar), on the morning of May 30, 2021.
