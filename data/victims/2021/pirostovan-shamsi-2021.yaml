    News and information regarding the execution of Ms. Shamsi Pirostovan and
    her former husband was published by the Human Rights Organization of Iran,
    on May 31, 2021. Under pressure from her family, Ms. Pirostovan had
    divorced her husband, who was also her cousin, while she was in prison in
    2018. Her case was related to drug offenses. Arrest and detention Ms.
    Pirostovan and her husband were arrested while driving on the Qazvin Karaj
    Freeway, in 2014-2015. The exact time and circumstances of her arrest are
    not known. Trial No information is available on Ms. Pirostovan s trial or
    trials. Charges The charge brought against Ms. Pirostovan and her former
    husband was transporting 380 kilograms of narcotics . There is no
    information about the details of the charge or charges brought against
    her. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences, against their opponents (including political, civil society
    activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities).
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Ms. Pirostovan. Defense No information is available on Ms.
    Pirostovan s defense. Judgement The court sentenced Ms. Pirostovan to
    death. She and her former husband were executed in Qazvin Central Prison
    (Choubin Dar), on the morning of May 30, 2021. Mrs. Pirostovan is the
    first woman to be executed in Iran, on drug related charges, since the
    amendment of the anti-narcotic laws.
