quotes:
  - "As mountaineers and nature lovers, it was the first time we saw a Kurdish political organization that also had programs for nature and the ecosystem. They also had programs for women, for youth, for everything. Programs that were very different from what we had heard before. My family has a background of supporting the PDKI [Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan]. Nine of my close relatives lost their lives for their support of this party. However, we developed an interest in this party by observing the young guerrillas during mountaineering, particularly the female guerrillas. In contrast to the male speakers in other previous political parties, the women in this group confidently expressed their opinions on a range of political and social issues. Their ability to engage in discourse on these topics was a novel experience for us. In addition, their behavior in the mountains and their articulation of organizational goals and programs contributed to our interest in them."

    Mr. Rebin Rahimi, a supporter of the PJAK party, left Iran for Iraqi
    Kurdistan in 2012 with his wife Zoleikha Naseri. This was done in order to
    avoid potential persecution by the Iranian government, as well as to evade
    the risk of information leakage to security officials. Joint explanation
    of the Kurdistan Human Rights Network (Network) and the "Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran (ABC): This case is a part of
    the collaborative documentation of the Kurdistan Human Rights Network and
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center. The Kurdistan Human Rights Network
    intends to gradually document cases of extrajudicial executions of Kurdish
    citizens and activists. For this purpose, the network has used the
    experiences and research methodology of the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center,
    which has been active in the field of documenting human rights violations
    in Iran for many years. The report of this case and subsequent reports
    will be published in the "documentation" section of the Kurdistan Human
    Rights Network website and the "Omid Memorial" of the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center. Some of the original and follow-up interviews used in
    this documentation were conducted by the Center, some by the Network, and
    some in collaboration. Information regarding the extrajudicial execution
    of Mr. Behruz (Rebin Sana) Rahimi, son of Jeiran and Saleh, born in
    Sanandaj, Kurdistan Province, married, was obtained from interviews with
    his wife, Ms. Zoleikha (Ronahi) Naseri (April 18, May 1, and February 4,
    2023), an informed source on the case (January 11, 2023), and a cadre
    member of PJAK (May 1, 2023). Additional information was taken from the
    websites of ANF News Agency (March 29, 2021), Rudaw Media Network (in
    Kurdish, November 7, 2023), Kurdistan Human Rights Network (July 16,
    2021), PJAK (July 19, 2021), the Bitawan Association blog (August 5,
    2021), and the archives of ABC and the Kurdistan Human Rights Network. Mr.
    Rahimi was born into a Kurdish Sunni family on September 9, 1973. He
    attended school until middle school, then dropped out and entered the
    labor market early. From the age of 14, he worked at "Jaleh," a
    construction company owned by his brother. Shortly after joining the
    company, he took over the responsibility of the company's procurement
    department. (ABC Interview, April 18, 2023) Mr. Rahimi voluntarily helped
    some drug users in their rehabilitation process in the relevant centers,
    including in the cities of Qorveh and Hamedan. After reducing the side
    effects of drug abuse in these people, he encouraged them to engage in
    sports, especially mountaineering. (ABC Interview, April 18, 2023) In
    2002, Mr. Rahimi, along with his wife (Zoleikha Naseri), became acquainted
    with the goals and programs of the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK)
    through the "Nojin" mountaineering group in Sanandaj. Regarding the
    reason(s) for their "support" of this party, Ms. Naseri says: "As
    mountaineers and nature lovers, it was the first time we saw a Kurdish
    political organization that also had programs for nature and the
    ecosystem. They also had programs for women, for youth, for everything.
    Programs that were very different from what we had heard before. My family
    has a background of supporting the PDKI [Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan]. Nine of my close relatives lost their lives for their support
    of this party. However, we developed an interest in this party by
    observing the young guerrillas* during mountaineering, particularly the
    female guerrillas. In contrast to the male speakers in other previous
    political parties, the women in this group confidently expressed their
    opinions on a range of political and social issues. Their ability to
    engage in discourse on these topics was a novel experience for us. In
    addition, their behavior in the mountains and their articulation of
    organizational goals and programs contributed to our interest in them. As
    a result, we began working with the group on organizational activities
    from the very beginning. (ABC Interview, April 18, 2023) These activities
    continued until 2012, when Ms. Naseri was summoned by intelligence and
    security officials in Sanandaj. Mr. Rahimi and his wife fled to Iraqi
    Kurdistan because they were afraid of revealing information under pressure
    from security officials. (ABC Interview, May 1, 2023) Shortly after their
    departure, Mr. Rahimi and his wife sought asylum at the United Nations
    High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office in Erbil. (ABC Interview,
    April 18, 2023, Rudaw Media Network, July 14, 2021) Mr. Rahimi and his
    wife began working in a bakery in the city of Qaladze with a meager
    income, and then moved to Sulaymaniyah. In Sulaymaniyah, Mr. Rahimi worked
    as a security guard in a warehouse and Ms. Naseri worked as a seamstress.
    (ABC Interview, April 18, 2023) Meanwhile, they continued their
    cooperation with the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK). (ABC Interview,
    April 18, 2023) Ms. Naseri continued her activities publicly by
    participating in media programs, but M
