    The execution of Mr. Hassan Rahmanipur Qahrudi and two other individuals
    was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on February 17, 1997. Arrest and
    Detention The exact circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. According to the Kayhan newspaper, the defendant was
    arrested on May 8, 1995. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Hassan Rahmanipur
    Qahrudi was announced as “murder of four members of his family.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the report, the evidence provided
    against the defendant was “his own confessions”. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of torture to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Hassan Rahmanipur Qahrudi’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Hassan Rahmanipur Ghahrudi to death and, after the ruling was confirmed by
    the Supreme Court, he was hanged in the presence of the secretary of the
    Special Complex for Executions, the Qasr prison warden, the victim’s
    family, and the forensic team on February 16, 1997.
