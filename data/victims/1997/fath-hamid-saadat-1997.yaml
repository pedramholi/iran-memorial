circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Hamid, along with Nazir Abdollahi, an Afghan citizen,
    was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on May 15, 1997. His last name is
    not mentioned in Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The commander of the security
    forces in Fars province has made the following statements about the
    charges against this defendant, as published in Kayhan : “Hamid and Nazir
    and another individuals entered a house in Shiraz during the night. They
    threatened and intimidated the residents and tied the hands and feet of
    the owner, raped his daughter, and stole some of the belongings of the
    house.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hamid’s
    defense. Judgment No specific information is available about the
    defendant’s execution. Mr. Hamid was executed in Shiraz. The report does
    not contain any information regarding the ruling and date of the
    execution.
