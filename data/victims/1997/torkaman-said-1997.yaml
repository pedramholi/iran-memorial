    The execution of Mr. Sa’id Torkaman, along with three other individuals,
    was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on March 13, 1997 and on the website
    of the Hamshahri newspaper on March 14, 1997. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial other than it
    took place in Tehran Public Court. Charges The charge against the
    defendant was announced as “murder.” According to the Kayhan newspaper,
    the defendant murdered the victim following an argument with him in a car.
    Then he injured several other passengers of the car and escaped. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Torkamanss defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Sa’id Torkaman to death and the ruling was confirmed by
    Branch 30 of the Supreme Court. On March 13, 1997, the ruling was
    explained to him by the Execution Manager in the Guard Office. After
    writing his will and performing the religious ceremony, he was hanged at
    Qasr prison (Tehran) before dawn.
