    The execution of Mr. Hossein Alimohammadi was announced on the website of
    the Hamshahri newspaper on November 19, 1997. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    According to the Hamshahri newspaper, the defendant, who was a fugitive
    after committing the crime, was later arrested. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial other than it took place in Branch
    Three of the Public Court in Shahrud (Semnan province). Charges The charge
    against Mr. Hossein Alimohammadi was announced as “three counts of
    murder.” According to the newspaper report, “the defendant was a friend of
    the victim’s family and a guest that night. During the night, he woke up
    and killed Majed Shahhosseini with stick. Then he approached the victim’s
    family who had woken up, killed two children and injured the wife and a
    two year old child, and escaped.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence
    reported against the defendant was his own “confessions.” International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of torture to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Alimohammadi’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hossein
    Alimohammadi to death and, after the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme
    Court, he was hanged in the presence of the victim’s family, the prison
    officials, and the security forces at Shahrud prison on November 18, 1997.
