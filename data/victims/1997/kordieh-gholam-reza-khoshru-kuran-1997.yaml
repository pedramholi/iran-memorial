    News of the trial and execution of Mr. Gholam Reza Khoshru Kuran Kordieh,
    born in Kharuj of Quchan, was published on the website of the Hamshahri
    newspaper on July 12, 22, 27, 31, and August 9, 14, 1997. Also, it was
    published on the website of the Iran newspaper on March 17, 2007.
    According to the Hamshahri newspaper, the defendant was arrested for
    robbery in Nishabur in 1982. Later on, he went to prison due to his own
    (false) claim of being a Soviet spy. Again, on April 12, 1993, he was
    arrested for rape and armed robbery under the false name of "Morad
    Naderi," but he escaped during his transfer from prison to court. Arrest
    and Detention The circumstance of this defendant’s arrest is not known.
    According to the media reports, in July of 1997, the Basiji agents
    suspected him in a park. They found a car key in his pocket and noticed a
    car parked nearby. They arrested him and took him to the Baghefeiz police
    station. Trial The trial of this defendant took place in Branch 35 of
    Tehran Public Court. In the first session, Gholam Reza Khoshru introduced
    himself and said that he was 28 years old, residing in a village near
    Quchan. According to the Hamshahri newspaper, the second session was held
    to investigate violations of public chastity and, in order to protect the
    victims' families, was announced closed to the public. Charges The charges
    against the defendant were announced as "car robbery, kidnapping,
    committing nine counts of murder, attempting to kill his infant nephew,
    and escaping the police in 1993." According to the Hamshahri newspaper,
    the defendant used a stolen car as a taxi and took his victims, mostly
    women, out of town in order to murder them. Before the trial, the judge
    told the reporters that "from March of 1996 to July of 1997, the defendant
    committed nine counts of murder with no similarities at all." The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The media reported the evidences provided
    against the defendant as follows: According to the judge, "on June 25,
    1997, several bodies were found around Tehran especially in the western
    area. It became evident that the defendant committed those murders and
    later on it was evident that he committed several robberies in Khorasan
    province from 1993 until 1995, and spent some time in Vakilabad and Quchan
    prisons." Also, evidence against the defendant was his own "confessions"
    during the interrogation. According to the Hamshahri newspaper, after the
    defendant denied his confessions and introduced the perpetrator as Hamid
    Rasuli, the court gathered all people with such names face to face before
    the defendant between two open sessions. None of them was his
    collaborator. In the second session, the judge stated that in spite of the
    defendant's denial, there was much evidence against him, such as finding
    the stolen goods in his brother and sister's house, that proved his guilt.
    Also, a witness testified in the court that he identified the defendant
    passing by when he dumped the bodies of a mother and daughter near trash
    and fled. Defense In the second trial session, the attorney for the
    defendant said: "The duty of an attorney is to prevent the truth from
    being hidden, and avoid injustice against the defendant. But, in this
    case, injustice and oppression of this murderer was imposed on the victims
    and their families and people's hearts are broken. I'm not his attorney.
    I'm the prosecutor. How can I deny the charges when the defendant clearly
    confessed to his sins in front of the officials and the media?" According
    to the Hamshahri newspaper, in the court sessions, the defendant denied
    any wrong doing in spite of his confessions during the interrogations. He
    blamed Hamid Rasuli for the crimes and claimed that he was only the
    driver. He only confessed to one count of car jacking and assisting Hamid
    Rasuli in sharing the victims' belongings. In the second session, in
    response to the judge's question about putting his nephew in a drawer in
    order to kill him, he answered calmly: "Because the child was crying and I
    wanted to calm him." According to the media report, the defendant's
    responses to the questions were conflicting but the judge of Branch 35 of
    Tehran Public Court said that the coroner examined him and considered him
    healthy. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Gholam Reza Khoshru to 214
    lashes and death. His case was sent by a special messenger to t
