province: "Khorasan\\Khorasan-e Razavi"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Hanging"
circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown man, along with eleven others, was
    published in the Kayhan newspaper on July 14, 1997. Arrest and Detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The trial of
    this defendant took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Mashhad.
    Charges The charge against the defendant was announced as "being active
    and armed in transferring narcotics to the country." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on the defense. Judgment The court condemned
    the defendant to death and, after the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme
    Court, he was hanged in public. No information is available about the
    exact date of the execution.
