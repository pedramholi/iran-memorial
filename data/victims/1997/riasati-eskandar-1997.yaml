circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Eskandar Riasati, along with three other individuals,
    was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on June 15, 1997. Arrest and
    Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial
    other than it took place at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz.
    Charges The charges against the defendant were announced as “purchase,
    possession, and trafficking of 1,500 kilograms narcotics.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, methadone, or
    morphine). The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Riasati’s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Eskandar Riasati to death and, after the
    ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was executed in Shiraz. The
    exact date of this execution is unknown.
