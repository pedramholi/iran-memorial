    The execution of Mr. Khodabakhsh Saboki, along with four other
    individuals, was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on December 10, 1997.
    Arrest and Detention The exact circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. According to the Kayhan newspaper, the
    defendant was arrested by the security forces of the Crime Investigation
    Unit of Hormozgan Province a week after the incident, in July 1997. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant’s trial other than he was
    tried at Branch Nine of Bandar Abbas Public Court. Charges The charges
    against the defendant were announced as “murdering three members of a
    family and stealing their money and home appliances.” According to the
    newspaper report, on June 25, 1997, the defendant, along with four other
    individuals, entered the house of Mohammad Amini Baluchi, an engineer in
    Bandar Abbas refinery, at night, aware of the fact that he had received
    his several months’ salary. They murdered him, his wife, and his
    brother-in-law, stole 500 thousand Rials cash and some appliances, and
    escaped. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Khodabakhsh Saboki’s
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Khodabakhsh Saboki to death and,
    after the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was hanged in
    public in the Islamabad quarter of Bandar Abbas, where the alleged crime
    took place, on December 9, 1997.
