circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Reza Akhlaqi, along with three other individuals, was
    announced in the Kayhan newspaper on March 13, 1997 and on the website of
    the Hamshahri newspaper on March 14, 1997. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial other than it
    took place at the Tehran Public Court. Charges The charge against the
    defendant was announced as “murder.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Akhlaqi’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Reza Akhlaqi to death
    and the ruling was confirmed by Branch 19 of the Supreme Court. On March
    13, 1997, the ruling was explained to him by the Execution Manager in the
    Guard Office and, having written his will and performed of the religious
    ceremony, he was hanged at Qasr prison (Tehran) before dawn.
