    News of the execution of Mr. Zakaria Zera’atgar, a resident of the village
    of Sa’ich in Amol (Mazandaran province), was published in the Kayhan
    newspaper on January 24, 1997. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. According to the newspaper report,
    the trial of this defendant took place in an Amol court. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Zakaria Zera’atgar was announced as “murdering
    Habibollah Khakpur.” There are no details about the charge in the
    newspaper report. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Zera’atgar’s defense. Judgment According to the Kayhan newspaper, the
    court condemned Mr. Zakaria Zera’atgar to death and, after the ruling was
    confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was executed.
