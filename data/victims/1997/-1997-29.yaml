circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown person, along with five others, was
    published in the Kayhan newspaper on October 25, 1997. According to the
    report, one of these people worked for the Center to Fight Narcotics in
    Mazandaran province. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. The trial took place in the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court in Sari. Charges With no reference to the official
    sources, the reporter of the Kayhan newspaper reported the charges against
    the defendant as "establishing a house of corruption and deluding boys and
    girls." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense. Judgment
    The court condemned this unknown person to death and, after the ruling was
    confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was executed in public in Sari. The
    exact date of this execution is unknown.
