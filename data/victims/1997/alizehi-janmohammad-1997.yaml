    The execution of Mr. Janmohammad Alizehi, son of Aqamohammad and an Afghan
    citizen, along with four other individuals, was announced on the website
    of the Hamshahri newspaper on August 7, 1997 and the Kayhan newspaper on
    August 12, 1997 (as Janmohammad Zehi). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    According to the Kayhan report, the defendants were arrested following
    continuous operations by the security forces in Gonabad (Khorasan
    province). Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    According to the Hamshahri newspaper, the trial of this defendant took
    place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Torbate Heidarieh (Khorasan
    province). Charges The Kayhan report announced the charges against the
    defendant as “causing insecurity in the region, smuggling opium, and
    possession of arms.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, methadone, or morphine). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Alizehi’s defense. Judgment Mr.
    Janmohammad Alizehi was condemned to death and the Supreme Court confirmed
    the ruling. He was hanged in public at Ahmadian intersection in Gonabad on
    August 6, 1997.
