    Information on the disappearance and extrajudicial killing of Mr. Ahmad
    Aqa i, has been gathered from Abdorrahman s Boroumand Center s interview
    with an acquaintance of another person who disappeared in Esfahan at the
    same time (February 22 and 28, 2022, and March 4 and 5, 2022). Additional
    information was collected from Radio Farhang Website (February 1, 2022)
    and Center for Parliamentary Research Website (September 7, 1997). Mr.
    Ahmad Aqa i was probably a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (ABC interview, February 28, 2022). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. (2) Forced Disappearance And Murder Of Mr. Ahmad Aqa i On January
    10 or 11, 1997, Mr. Ahmad Aqa i disappeared, probably after going to the
    Esfahan Information Office Press Office. Since agents from this office
    kept reassuring his family that he would be released from this office,
    they believe he was at the Esfahan Information Office Press Office on
    Kamal Esma il Street, near Enqelab Square (ABC interview, February 22 and
    28, 2022). According to available information, Mr. Aqa i was one of the
    supporters of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who disappeared during an
    operation named Alghadir. This operation was carried out by the
    Information Ministry of the Islamic Republic, with the goal of kidnapping
    and killing members and supporters of MKO. There is no information on him
    or on a number of other people from Esfahan who disappeared at the same
    time. Sometime before Mr. Aqa i was abducted, thousands of prisoners were
    executed during the mass killings of the summer of 1988. (2) Many of these
    were considered Mojahedin Khalq Organization leaders . According to
    available information and comments made by responsible officials, Mr. Aqa
    i and the rest of the missing people were probably killed by the same
    logic (Boroumand Center Research). Several other people also disappeared
    at the same time as Mr. Ahmad Aqa'i, at the Esfahan Information Office
    Press Office. These include Ms. Mahbubeh Bahadori , Ms. Zohreh Mazaheri ,
    Ms. Afsaneh (Parvin) Tahmasebi , Mr. Mohammad Aqa Aqa'i , and Mr. Faraj
    Farzadnia . Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic
    of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of politically
    motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the 1979
    Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the country
    have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of
    individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of
    the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however,
    these murders began in February 1979, with the murder of Parviz Sayyah
    Sina, an Anglican Bishop, and have continued since then, both inside and
    outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far identified over
    540 extrajudicial killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic Republic
    of Iran.(3) Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic
    Republic outside Iran, where one of the first assassinations, that of a
    Navy Officer, Shahriar Shafiq, took place in Paris in December 1979. These
    assassinations have taken place in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In too many c
