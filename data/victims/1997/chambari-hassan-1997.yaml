circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Hassan Chambari was announced in the Kayhan newspaper
    on November 19, 1997. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial other than it took place at Branch 10
    of the Sari Court. Charges The charge against Mr. Hassan Chambari was
    announced as “murdering his brother-in-law, Sha’ban Mahmudi, in Sari
    [Mazandaran province] in 1991.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Chambari’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hassan Chambari to
    death and after the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was
    hanged in Sari in the presence of the victim’s family.
