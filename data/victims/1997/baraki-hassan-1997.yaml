    The execution of Mr. Hassan Baraki and another individual was announced on
    the website of the Hamshahri newspaper on April 10, 1997. Arrest and
    Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial
    other than he was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Zahedan.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Hassan Baraki were announced as
    “smuggling, robbery, and armed resistance against the security forces that
    resulted in the death of the military commander of the Konarak company.”
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on his defense. Judgment The court condemned
    Mr. Hassan Baraki to death and, after the ruling was confirmed by the
