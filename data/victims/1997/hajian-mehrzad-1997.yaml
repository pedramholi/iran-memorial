    following sources were used to collect additional information: Attachment

    Falakhan Electronic Publication - #58 (February 2, 2017); Azadiye Bayan
    Site (August 17, 2019); and Deedgah Site (research date: October 3, 2021).
    Mr. Mehrzad Hajian was born in Tehran, in 1959. He was single. He was
    arrested in or about 1981, for his support of the MKO. He was in prison
    until 1991 (Boroumand Center Interview, October 18, 2021). He probably
    spent most of this time in Evin Prison. He worked in the translation
    center of the prison. They translated different materials, including
    brochures for the Ministry of Industry (Boroumand Center Interview,
    October 20, 2021). After he was released from prison, Mr. Hajian worked as
    an English translator at a translation firm in Enqelab Street in Tehran.
    At this time, he was an undergraduate student at Allameh Tabataba i
    University, studying Management and Communications. Mr. Hajian continued
    to be a supporter of the MKO after he left prison (Boroumand Center
    Interview, October 18, 2021). Mr. Maleki described him as tall, calm,
    dispassionate, dignified, and polite. Mr. Hajian was interested in music
    (Boroumand Center Interview, October 18, 2021). The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. (2) Forced Disappearance And Murder Of Mr. Mehrzad Hajian
    According to available evidence, Mr. Mehrzad Hajian contacted a member of
    the MKO in the summer of 1996, with the intention of joining Ashraf Camp,
    located in Diyaleh Province in Iraq, 80 kilometers from the Iranian
    border. Five other people were with him at that time: Mr. Mehrdad Kamali ,
    Mr. Ali Asghar Bidi , Mr. Ala Mobasherian , and two other people whose
    names are not known at this time (Boroumand Center Interview with Mr.
    Maleki who would meet with him every week during 1994-1996, October 18,
    2021; Boroumand Center Interview, October 20, 2021). According to
    available information, Mr. Hajian was one of the supporters of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who disappeared during an operation named
    Alghadir. This operation was carried out by the Information Ministry of
    the Islamic Republic, with the goal of kidnapping and killing members and
    supporters of MKO. There is no information about him and about his
    companions who were captured because of their affiliation with the MKO in
    Iraq. Available research shows that Mr. Hajian and many others who were
    kidnapped in this operation never even reached the Mojahedin Khalq camps
    in Iraq. Mr. Hajian and his companions were survivors of the mass
    execution
