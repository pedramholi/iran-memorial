    The execution of Mr. Amel Nasiri, along with his brother, Shamel, sons of
    Jamshid, residents of Ardebil, was announced in the Kayhan newspaper,
    referring to the communiqu of the Public Relations of Tehran Province
    Tribunal on January 19, 1997. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charge against these
    defendants was announced as four counts of murder. According to the
    newspaper report, in October of 1995, they entered a house in order to
    steal money, and killed two women and two children present at the house.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Nasiri s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Amel Nasiri to death and he and his brother were hanged at
    Qasr prison (Tehran) on January 15, 1997.
