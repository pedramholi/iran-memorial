    News of the execution of Mr. Ebrahim Bahramian was published on the
    website of the Hamshahri newspaper on January 10, 1997. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The
    trial of this defendant took place in the Samirom court (Esfehan
    province). Charges The charge against Mr. Ebrahim Bahramian was announced
    as “murder” of Ehsan Asadi in May of 1996. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ebrahim Bahramian’s defense. Judgment Mr. Ebrahim
    Bahramian was condemned to death. After the ruling was confirmed by the
    Supreme Court, he was hanged in the presence of the victim's family in
    Sa’at Circle in Samirom.
