circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Anvari, along with another individuals,
    was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on January 8, 1997. Arrest and
    Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Anvari were announced as “kidnapping,
    torture, harming youth, and corruption.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Anvari’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Mohammad Ali Anvari to death and he was executed in public in Qa’enat
    (Southern Khorasan province).
