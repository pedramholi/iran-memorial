    Mr. Abdollah Gorji’s execution was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on
    June 16, 1997. This news was also published on the website of the
    Hamshahri newspaper with the name of Abdollah Garmi. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Abdollah Gorji was announced as "murder." According to
    the newspapers' report, in March of 1997, the defendant attempted a
    robbery from the house of a policeman, Sirus Khodadadi in Qarveh
    (Kordestan province); but he was confronted with resistance and after a
    fight, he killed the victim with blows of a knife. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Abdollah Gorji's defense. Judgment The court condemned
    Mr. Abdollah Gorji to death and after the ruling was confirmed by the
    Supreme Court, he was executed in the presence of the victim's family in
    Qarveh on June 15, 1997.
