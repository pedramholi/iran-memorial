circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Jamshid Mehraban, son of Ahmad, along with three
    other individuals, was announced in the communiqu of the Public Relations
    Officer of Esfahan Court and published in the Kayhan newspaper and on the
    website of the Hamshahri newspaper on March 14, 1997. Arrest and Detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial other than it
    took place at the Esfahan Province Court. Charges The charges against the
    defendant were announced as kidnapping. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mehraban s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Jamshid Mehraban to death and, after the ruling was confirmed by the
    Supreme Court, he was hanged in public in Khomeini Shahr (Esfehan
    province) on March 14, 1997.
