circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ali Mirenayat, along with three other individuals,
    was announced in the communiqué of the Public Relations Officer of Esfahan
    Court and published in the Kayhan newspaper and on the website of the
    Hamshahri newspaper on March 14, 1997. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial other than it
    took place at Esfahan Province Court. Charges The charges against the
    defendant were announced as “three counts of kidnapping and rape.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Mirenayat’s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Ali Mirenayat to death and, after the ruling was confirmed
    by the Supreme Court, he was hanged in public in Khomeini Shahr (Esfehan
    province) on March 13, 1997.
