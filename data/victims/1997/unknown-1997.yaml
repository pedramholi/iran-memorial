    This unknown individual was a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. This person disappeared in 1996, trying to join the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in Iraq and was killed that same year, or
    shortly thereafter, by agents of the Information Ministry. Information
    about the extrajudicial killing of an unknown person was collected from an
    interview with Mr. Hossein Maleki, one of his companion s friends (October
    18 and November 23, 2021), and an interview with Mr. Iraj Mesdaqi, one of
    his companion s former cellmates (October 20, 2021). The news of this
    killing was also published in the website of Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) (December 26, 2016). The following sources were used to collect
    additional information: Attachment to the Report of 1988 Killings;
    Accounts of Relatives and Remarks of Officials, prepared by Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center (September 2009); Pezhvak-e Iran Site (December 3, 2008);
    30,000 Roses of Iran Weblog (March 8, 2013); Iran Efshagari Website
    (research date: October 3, 2021); Falakhan Electronic Publication - #58
    (February 2, 2017); Azadiye Bayan Site (August 17, 2019); and Deedgah Site
    (research date: October 3, 2021). The only information available on this
    unknown person is that he had been a supporter of Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (Boroumand Center Interview, October 18, 2021; Pezhvak
    Website, December 3, 2008). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. (2) Forced Disappearance And Murder Of An Unknown Person
    According to available evidence, this unknown person contacted a member of
    the MKO in the summer of 1996, with the intention of joining Ashraf Camp,
    located in Diyaleh Province in Iraq, 80 kilometers from the Iranian
    border. Five other people were with him at that time: Mr. Mehrdad Kamali ,
    Mr. Ali Asghar Bidi , Mr. Ala Mobasherian , Mr. Mehrzad Hajian , and
    another person whose name is not known at this time (Boroumand Center
    Interview with Mr. Maleki who would meet with him every week during
    1994-1996, October 18, 2021; Boroumand Center Interview, October 20,
    2021). According to available information, this unknown person was one of
    the supporters of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who disappeared during
    an operation named Alghadir. This operation was carried out by the
    Information Ministry of the Islamic Republic, with the goal of kidnapping
    and killing members and supporters of MKO. There is no information about
    him and about his companions who were captured because of their
    affiliation with the MKO in Iraq. Available research shows that this
    unknown person and many others who were kidnapped in this operation never
    even reached the Mojahedin Khalq camps in Iraq. This unknown person and
    his companions were survivors of the mass executions of prisoners in the
    summer of 1989 (2). During this time, thousands of prisoners, including
    members of the MKO who were thought to hold leadership positions were
    executed. According to available information and comments made by
    responsible officials, this unknown person and the rest of the missing
    people were probably killed by the same logic (Boroumand Center Research).
    It is not clear when this unknown person and his companions were trapped
    by the Information Ministry. They were most probably killed in the winter
    of 1997, or at the very latest, the fall of that year (Boroumand Center
