    The execution of Mr. Hossein Darvish and two other individuals was
    announced in the Kayhan newspaper on February 17, 1997. Arrest and
    Detention According to the Kayhan newspaper, the police identified the
    defendant as a person who would inherit from the victims and arrested him.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Hossein Darvish was announced as “two counts of
    murder.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the newspaper report,
    “On February 27, 1996, an old woman and an old man died in a fire in
    Shahrak Emam. The police identified [the defendant as] a person who stood
    to inherit from the victims. It was disclosed that he spent the previous
    night in their house. [The defendant] confessed to the interrogator that
    in order to achieve his goal [inheritance], he shot and killed his aunt
    and her husband and set their bodies ablaze.” International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of torture to obtain confessions
    from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions
    obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hossein
    Darvish’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hossein Darvish to
    death and, after the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was
    hanged in the presence of the secretary of the Special Complex for
    Executions, the Qasr prison warden, the victim’s family, and the forensic
    team on February 16, 1997.
