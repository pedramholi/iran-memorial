    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Reza Esteqlaltalab Estahbanati was
    published in the Kayhan newspaper on August 10, 1997. Arrest and Detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The trial of
    this defendant took place in Branch 42 of Esfahan Public Court. Charges
    The charge against Mr. Ali Reza Esteqlaltalab Estahbanati was announced as
    "murdering a four and a half year old girl." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Alireza Esteqlaltalab Estahbanati's defense. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Ali Reza Esteqlaltalab Estahbanati to death and he was
