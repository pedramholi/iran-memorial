circumstances: >
    News of the execution of six unknown persons was published in the Kayhan
    newspaper and on the website of the Hamshahri newspaper on September 23,
    1997. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of these defendants’ arrests
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendants' trial. Charges The charges against these six people were
    announced as "bothering and harming people and violations." There are no
    further explanations in the media reports. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendants. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment According to the Kayhan newspaper
    reporter, based on the ruling of the Islamic Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor, these defendants were recognized as "corruptors on Earth" and
    were hanged in public in a square in Mashhad on September 22, 1997.
