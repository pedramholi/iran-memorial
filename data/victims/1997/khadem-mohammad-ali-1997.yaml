    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Khadem was published in the
    Kayhan newspaper on November 9, 1997 and on the website of the Hamshahri
    newspaper on November 10, 1997. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. This defendant was tried in Branch
    One of the Revolutionary Court. Charges The defendant was charged with
    “clashes in public, bothering women and girls, adultery, illicit relations
    with women and girl through intimidation, and sodomy” ( Hamshahri ). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The Hamshahri newspaper quotes the Public
    Relations Office of the Islamic Revolutionary Court that the defendant was
    tried following various complains made by people in Fallah quarter in
    Tehran. According to the Kayhan newspaper, before the revolution, there
    were several cases against the defendant for battery, rape, and conflicts
    with the police. After the revolution, he was also arrested and punished
    for various crimes including armed robbery from garrisons, sexual
    harassment, intimidation, rape, distribution of narcotics, immoral sexual
    relationships, participation in armed fighting, and establishing a "house
    of corruption". Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohammad Ali
    Khadem's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad Ali Khadem to
    death as a "corruptor on Earth". After the ruling was confirmed by the
    Supreme Court, he was hanged in public in the presence of judiciary and
    security officials in Abuzar (Fallah) quarter on November 9, 1997.
