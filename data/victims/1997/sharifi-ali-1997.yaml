    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Sharifi and another person was published
    on the website of the Hamshahri newspaper on November 25 and 26, 1997.
    Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. The defendant was arrested by the security forces
    of Hamadan in September of 1997. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. The trial of this defendant took place in the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Hamadan. Charges The charges against Mr. Ali
    Sharifi were announced as "sodomy, adultery, consumption of alcohol, and
    distribution of narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ali
    Sharifi's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ali Sharifi to 190
    lashes and death, and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court.
    According to the Hamshahri newspaper, after the defendant received the
    lashes, his bloody body was hanged in Be'sat square in Hamadan on November
    24, 1997.
