    News of the execution of Mr. Fathollah Ramezani (known as Hilu), son of
    Mirza, was sent to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center via four electronic forms
    by persons familiar with this case. (e-forms 1/12/2019, 1/10/2019,
    1/9/2019, and 10/30/2010). News of Mr. Ramezani s execution, along with
    the execution of Mr. Hemat Alipur , was published in Kayhan newspaper, as
    well as the website of Hamshahri newspaper, on July 30, 1997. Mr. Ramezani
    was born in 1960 in Darb-e Dalakan neighborhood in Khoramabad, Lorestan
    province. He had a fifth grade education. He was a freedom loving person.
    He had blue eyes and a long golden beard (e-forms 1/9/2019 10/30/2010).
    Arrest and Detention Mr. Ramezani was arrested by the agents of the
    Ministry of Intelligence. At the time of his arrest, he was surrounded by
    the agents but they did not dare getting close to him, until the head of
    the agents brought a Quran and asked Mr. Ramezani to surrender himself out
    of respect for the Quran. Mr. Ramezani then surrendered himself and was
    placed in restraints (handcuffs and chains around his ankles). Mr.
    Ramezani was tortured at the time of his arrest; according to an eye
    witness, the same person who sworen Mr. Ramezani to Quran ordered the
    agents to beat him. Mr. Ramezani spent eleven years in the central prison
    of Khorramabad. (e-forms 1/10/2019 1/9/2019) Trial Mr. Ramezani s trial
    took place in Branch 27 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran. Mr.
    Ramezani did not have access to a lawyer (e-form 1/9/2019). Charges The
    media reports quoted the Chief Judge of Branch two of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Khorramabad announcing the charges against Mr.
    Fathollah Ramezani as "disturbing the public order, spreading insecurity
    and fear among people, undermining public security and comfort by
    demonstration of drunkenness, yelling, hooliganism, moral corruption,
    participation in conflict on June 2, 1997, and insulting the religious
    sanctities." The reports do not explain the conflict on June 2, 1997.
    According to the electronic form, Mr. Ramezani was arrested because of
    fabricated charges of murder of two revolutionary guards and being
    anti-revolutionary (e-form 1/12/2019). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Ramezani. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ramezani s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Fathollah Ramezani as a "Corruptor on Earth" to 80 lashes and death, and
    the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. On the morning of July 29,
    1997, he received the lashes and was hanged in public, in front of Bakhtar
    hospital in Shohada square of Khorramabad. Mr. Ramezni was buried by the
    regime s agents; thousands of them were present for his burial. The agents
    marked his grave with mud and did not allow his family to place a
    gravestone. (e-form 1/9/2019)
