    News of the execution of Mr. Siavash Bayani was published in the Kayhan
    newspaper on September 1, 1997 and on the web site of the Hamshahri
    newspaper on September 2, 1997, which quoted the announcement issued by
    Tehran Military Court. The International Federation for Human Rights also
    reported this execution in its February 1999 report. According to the
    report, Mr. Siavash Bayani had been a pilot and a retired Air Force
    colonel. Additional information was obtained from Mr. Bayani's former
    cellmate. The Iranian media reported that Mr. Bayani had left Iran with
    his family and moved to the United States as a political refugee in 1983.
    He had returned to Iran after 11 years in exile. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    According to the Kayhan newspaper, he was arrested by "unknown soldiers of
    the Hidden Imam in the Security Intelligence of the Islamic Republic Army"
    in 1995. According to the report by the International Federation for Human
    Rights, the arrest of Mr. Siavash Bayani was never announced officially.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The trial took
    place in Tehran Military Court. Charges The charge against the defendant
    was reported as "giving secret military information to the United States."
    There is no further information about the charge in the media reports. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided against the defendant had been his
    own "confessions". International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Siavash Bayani's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Siavash
    Bayani to death and, after the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court,
