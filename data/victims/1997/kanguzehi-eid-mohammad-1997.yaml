    News of the execution of Mr. Eid-Mohammad Kanguzehi and another person was
    published in the Kayhan newspaper on April 12, and on the website of the
    Hamshahri newspaper on April 13, 1997. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The trial of
    this defendant took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Zabol
    (Sistan and Baluchestan province). Charges The charge against Mr.
    Eid-mohammad Kanguzehi was announced as “killing six policemen.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Eid-mohammad Kanguzehi’s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Eid-Mohammad Kanguzehi to death and after
    the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was executed in public
    in Zabol on April 12, 1997.
