    The execution of Mr. Hamid Kuhi and two other individuals was announced in
    the Kayhan newspaper on February 17, 1997. Arrest and Detention According
    to the Kayhan newspaper, the defendant was arrested as he was selling
    stolen goods. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The charge against Mr. Hamid Kuhi was announced as “murder.”
    According to the newspaper report, he was a “custodian in a residential
    complex. He entered [a woman’s] apartment with the intention of robbing
    her and murdered her with stabs of a knife.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    According to the report, the evidence provided against the defendant was
    “stolen goods and his own confessions”. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of torture to obtain confessions
    from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions
    obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hamid
    Kuhi’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hamid Kuhi to death and,
    after the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was hanged in the
    presence of the secretary of the Special Complex for Executions, the Qasr
    prison warden, the victim’s family, and the forensic team on February 16,
    1997.
