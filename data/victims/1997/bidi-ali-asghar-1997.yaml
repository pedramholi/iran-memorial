    Mr. Bidi was friendly, good humored, and energetic. Information about the
    extrajudicial killing of Mr. Ali Asghar (Mehdi) Bidi was collected from an
    interview with Mr. Hossein Maleki, one of his companion s friends and
    former cellmates (October 18 and November 23, 2021), and an interview with
    Mr. Iraj Mesdaqi, one of Mr. Bidi s former cellmates (October 20, 2021).
    The news of this killing was also published in the website of Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO) (December 26, 2016). The following sources were
    used to collect additional information: Attachment to the Report of 1988
    Killings; Accounts of Relatives and Remarks of Officials, prepared by
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (September 2009); Pezhvak-e Iran Site
    (December 3, 2008); 30,000 Roses of Iran Weblog (March 8, 2013); Iran
    Efshagari Website (research date: October 3, 2021); Falakhan Electronic
    Publication - #58 (February 2, 2017); Azadiye Bayan Site (August 17,
    2019); and Deedgah Site (research date: October 3, 2021). Mr. Ali Asghar
    (Mehdi) Bidi was born in Tehran. In the early 1980s he was arrested for
    following the Mojahedin Khalq Organizatioin. He remained in prison until
    1991. He probably spent most of this time in Evin Prison. (Boroumand
    center Interview, October 18, 2021; Boroumand Center Interview, October
    20, 2021; Iran Efshagari Site, October 3, 2021). Mr. Maleki described him
    as friendly, humorous, and energetic (Boroumand Center Interview, October
    18, 2021). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. (2) Forced Disappearance And
    Murder Of Mr. Ali Asghar (Mehdi) Bidi According to available evidence, Mr.
    Ali Asghar (Mehdi) Bidi contacted a member of the MKO in the summer of
    1996, with the intention of joining Ashraf Camp, located in Diyaleh
    Province in Iraq, 80 kilometers from the Iranian border. Five other people
    were with him at that time: Mr. Mehrdad Kamali , Mr. Mehrzad Hajian , Mr.
    Ala Mobasherian , and two other people whose names are not known at this
    time (Boroumand Center Interview with Mr. Maleki who would meet with him
    every week during 1994-1996, October 18, 2021; Boroumand Center Interview,
    October 20, 2021). According to available information, Mr. Bidi was one of
    the supporters of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who disappeared during
    an operation named Alghadir. This operation was carried out by the
    Information Ministry of the Islamic Republic, with the goal of kidnapping
    and killing members and supporters of MKO. There is no information about
    him and about his companions who were captured because of their
    affiliation with the MKO in Iraq. Available research shows that Mr. Bidi
    and many others who were kidnapped in this operation never even reached
    the Mojahedin Khalq camps in Iraq. Mr. Bidi and his companions were
    survivors of the mass executions of prisoners in the summer of 1989 (2).
    During this time, thousands of prisoners, including members of the MKO who
    were thought to hold leadership positions were executed. According to
    available information and comments made by responsible officials, Mr. Bidi
    and the rest of the missing people were probably killed by the same logic
    (Boroumand Center Research). Mr. Bidi was a survivor of the prisoner
    killings during the summer of 1989. He had spent almost ten years in
    prison. He disappeared in 1996, when he intended to join the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in Iraq. He has been killed by Information Ministry
    agents, either that year or some t
