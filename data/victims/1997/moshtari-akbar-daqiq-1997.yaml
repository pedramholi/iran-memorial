    The execution of Mr. Akbar Daqiq Moshtari, along with three other
    individuals, was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on March 13, 1997 and
    on the website of the Hamshahri newspaper on March 14, 1997. Arrest and
    Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial
    other than it took place in Branch 132 of the Criminal Court. Charges The
    charge against the defendant was announced as “murder.” According to the
    Kayhan newspaper, the defendant stabbed the victim with a knife following
    an argument. The victim died in the hospital. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Akbar Daqiq Moshtari’s defen’e. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Akbar Daqiq Moshtari to death and the ruling was confirmed
    by Branch 30 of the Supreme Court. On March 13, 1997, the ruling was
    explained to him by the Execution Manager in the Guard Office and, after
    writing his will and performing a religious ceremony, he was hanged at
    Qasr prison (Tehran) before dawn.
