    Mr. Mobasherian was a medical student. He was kind, humanitarian, and he
    did good deeds. He was a follower of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and
    he had spent almost ten years in prison. Information about the
    extrajudicial killing of Mr. Ala Mobahserian was collected from an
    interview with Mr. Hossein Maleki, one of his companion s friends (October
    18 and November 23, 2021), and an interview with Mr. Iraj Mesdaqi, one of
    Mr. Hajian s former cellmates (October 20, 2021). The news of this killing
    was also published in the website of Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    (December 26, 2016). The following sources were used to collect additional
    information: Attachment to the Report of 1988 Killings; Accounts of
    Relatives and Remarks of Officials, prepared by Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center (September 2009); Pezhvak-e Iran Site (December 3, 2008); 30,000
    Roses of Iran Weblog (March 8, 2013); Iran Efshagari Website (research
    date: October 3, 2021); Falakhan Electronic Publication - #58 (February 2,
    2017); Azadiye Bayan Site (August 17, 2019); and Deedgah Site (research
    date: October 3, 2021). Mr. Ala Mobahserian was born in 1957 and he was a
    medical student. He was arrested sometime in the early 1980s, because he
    was a follower of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He was in prison until
    1991. He probably spent most of this time in Evin Prison (Boroumand Center
    Interview, October 18, 2021; Boroumand Center Interview, October 20,
    2021). According to information on the 30,000 Roses of Iran Weblog, He had
    been severely tortured in prison. Consequently, when he was released he
    suffered from many injuries, including heart disease (30,000 Roses of Iran
    Weblog, March 8, 2013). One of Mr. Mobasherian s relatives described him
    as kind and humanitarian person, whose only concern was helping people and
    providing for the poor. (30,000 Roses of Iran Weblog) The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. (2) Forced Disappearance And Murder Of Mr. Ala Mobasherian
    According to available evidence, Mr. Ala Mobasherian contacted a member of
    the MKO in the summer of 1996, with the intention of joining Ashraf Camp,
    located in Diyaleh Province in Iraq, 80 kilometers from the Iranian
    border. Five other people were with him at that time: Mr. Mehrdad Kamali ,
    Mr. Ali Asghar Bidi , Mr. Mehrzad Hajian , and two other people whose
    names are not known at this time (Boroumand Center Interview with Mr.
    Maleki who would meet with him every week during 1994-1996, October 18,
    2021; Boroumand Center Interview, October 20, 2021). According to
    available information, Mr. Mobasherian was one of the supporters of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who disappeared during an operation named
    Alghadir. This operation was carried out by the Information Ministry of
    the Islamic Republic, with the goal of kidnapping and killing members and
    supporters of MKO. There is no information about him and about his
    companions who were captured because of their affiliation with the MKO in
    Iraq. Available research shows that Mr. Mobasherian and many others who
    were kidnapped in this operation never even reached the Mojahedin Khalq
    camps in Iraq. Mr. Mobasherian and his companions were survivors of the
    mass executions of prisoners in the summer of 1989 (2). During this time,
    thousands of prisoners, including members of the MKO who were thought to
    hold leadership positions were executed. According to available
