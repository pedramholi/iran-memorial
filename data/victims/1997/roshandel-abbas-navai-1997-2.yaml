    Mr. Nava i was married and he had children. He had a tire shop in Mashhad.
    Information on the abduction and killing of Mr. Abbas Nava i Roshandel was
    obtained from an interview conducted by Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with
    Mr. Iraj Mesdaqi, who is a Human Rights activist and a friend of Mr. Nava
    i (August 26, 2022). Information on this killing has also been published
    in the People s Mojahedin Organization of Iran website (December 26, 2016)
    and Pajhwok website (December 3, 2008 and August 30, 2009). Additional
    information on this case has been gleaned from Deedgah website (research
    date: August 26, 2022), Eshterak website (August 17, 2019), and Shahrvand
    website (March 8, 2012). Mr. Nava i was married and he had children. He
    was a supporter of the People s Mojahedin Organization of Iran and he had
    spent part of the 1980s in prison. He was released from prison in mid 1987
    and he had to check in with the Information Office of Mashhad every month
    (Pajhwok website Dec 3, 2008; Eshterak website, August 17, 2019; Shahrvand
    website, March 8, 2012). He had a tire store in Mashhad (Boroumand Center
    interview, August 26, 2022). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and to recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. (1) Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic
    of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of politically
    motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the 1979
    Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the country
    have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of
    individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of
    the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however,
    these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since then, both
    inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far
    identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases, there has not been much published, and
    local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
    evidence, and traces obtained through investigations conducted by local
    police and judicial authorities confirm the theory of state committed
    crimes. In some instances, these investigations have resulted in the
    expulsion or arrest of Iranian diplomats. In a few cases outside Iran, the
    perpetrators of these murders have been arrested and put on trial. The
    evidence presented revealed the defendants connection to Iran s government
    institutions, and an arrest warrant has been issued for Iran s Minister of
    Information. The manner in which these killings were organized and
    implemented in Iran and abroad is indicative of a single pattern which,
    according to Roland Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor, contains common
    parameters and detailed planning. It can be ascertained from the
    similarities between these murders in different countries that the Iranian
    government is the principal entity that ordered the implementation of
    these crimes. Iranian authorities have not officially accepted
    responsibility for these murders and have even attribu
