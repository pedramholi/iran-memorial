    The execution of Mr. Jalal Azarbaijani, a government clerk, was published
    on the website of the Hamshahri newspaper on September 22, 1997 and in the
    Kayhan newspaper on September 21, 1997. Arrest and detention The Kayhan
    newspaper quotes the defendant as saying that he turned himself in after
    committing the crime. Trial According to the Kayhan newspaper, the first
    ruling against him, at Branch 35 of Public Court, was based on accepting
    the insanity plead; but it was rejected by Branch 2 of the Supreme
    Judicial Court. The second trial took place at Branch 30 of Tehran Public
    Court. Charges The charge against the defendant was announced as
    “murdering his wife, his daughter aged 13, and his son aged 8”. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the Kayhan newspaper report,
    evidence of guilt against the defendant was his “confessions”.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. In the case of political detainees, these confessions are,
    at times, televised. The National Television broadcasts confessions during
    which prisoners plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and
    renounce their political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights
    organizations have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by
    those prisoners who are freed. Defense According to the Kayhan newspaper,
    his defense was based on the claim of insanity. He later told the court
    (presumably at his second trial): “Suspicion overwhelmed me. Therefore, I
    decided to murder my wife and two children. At night, I waited for them to
    fall asleep. Then, I killed my wife, Fatemeh Azarbaijani, first, and then
    my daughter, Simin, and my son, Ramin and I turned myself in to the police
    afterwards.” Judgment Mr. Jalal Azarbaijani, whose death penalty was
    commuted at his first trial due to his insanity plea, was condemned to
    death at his second trial. After the Supreme Court confirmed this ruling,
    he was hanged at Qasr prison (Tehran) in the presence of the victims’
    family and officials on September 21, 1997.
