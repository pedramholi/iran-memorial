    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Shahid and six others was published
    in the Kayhan newspaper and on the website of the Hamshahri newspaper on
    September 23, 1997. Arrest and Detention According to the Hamshahri
    newspaper, the defendant, after escaping the Miandoab prison (West
    Azarbaijan province), was arrested by the security forces of Ferdos (South
    Khorasan province) and handed over to the judicial officials. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge
    against Mr. Hossein Shahid was announced as "drug trafficking." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the
    Hamshahri newspaper, the defendant had 57.5 kilograms of narcotics in his
    possession when arrested. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Hossein Shahid's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hossein Shahid
    to death as a "corruptor on Earth" and, after the ruling was confirmed by
    the Supreme Court, he was executed in public in Emam Khomeini square of
    Ferdos on September 22, 1997.
