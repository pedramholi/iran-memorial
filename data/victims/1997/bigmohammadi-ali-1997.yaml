    The execution of Mr. Ali Bigmohammadi was announced in the Kayhan
    newspaper on January 3, 1997. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial other than it took place in the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Qazvin. Charges The charges against Mr.
    Ali Bigmohammadi were announced as “murdering two people and participation
    in 20 armed robberies.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ali
    Bigmohammadi’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ali Bigmohammadi
    to death and, after the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was
    executed in public. Kayhan does not mention the date of this execution.
