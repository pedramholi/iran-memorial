    The execution of Mr. Abdollah Hajizadeh, son of Kheirollah, along with
    four other individuals, was announced by the Kayhan newspaper on February
    26, 1997. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial other than it took place at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashhad. Charges The charges against the
    defendant were announced as “buying and selling narcotics, importing 1,360
    kilograms of narcotics, clashing with the security forces, and killing two
    agents.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine, methadone, or morphine). The exact number of people
    convicted based on such trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Abdollah Hajizadeh’s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Abdollah Hajizadeh to death. After the ruling was confirmed
    by the Supreme Court, he was hanged in public in Fariman. The exact date
    of this execution is unknown.
