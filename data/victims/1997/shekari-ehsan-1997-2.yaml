    A fugitive from compulsory military service, Mr. Shekari was frequently on
    the run. A letter from a kidney association gave him reason to travel to
    Tehran for an organ donation. The execution of Mr. Ehsan Shekari was
    announced on the website of the Hamshahri newspaper on September 22, 1997
    and the Kayhan newspaper on September 21, 1997. Arrest and detention
    According to the Kayhan newspaper report, in spite of the defendant s
    constant travels, he was arrested on May 1, 1996 due to the authorities
    efforts to arrest him in Mashad and Nishabur (Khorasan province). Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial other than it took place
    at Branch 35 of Tehran Public Court. Charges According to the Kayhan
    newspaper report, Ehsan Shekari, age 24, and a fugitive soldier [i.e.
    serving compulsory military service] was referred from Mashhad to Tehran
    in order to donate one of his kidneys to the victim s mother, based on a
    letter by the Association for Supporting Kidney Patients. In preparation
    for the transplant and completing the necessary medical tests, he resided
    in the victim s house several times. During his last stay overnight, he
    murdered the 13 year old member of the family, with satanic motives. This
    report provides no explanation of such motives. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence of guilt against the defendant are his own confession and the
    statements of the victim s father. The Kayhan newspaper quotes this
    person: On April 17, 1996 at 5 am, I woke up anxiously with the cry of my
    son, Mohsen When I entered his room, I saw him submerged in his blood, and
    a bloody knife was in the hand of the murderer. I tried to catch the knife
    but it cut my hand and the killer was able to escape. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the
    case of political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised.
    The National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners
    plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their
    political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations
    have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those
    prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Shekari s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ehsan Shekari to
    death. After the confirmation of the Supreme Court he was executed at Qasr
    prison (Tehran) in the presence of the victim s family and the officials
    on September 21, 1997.
