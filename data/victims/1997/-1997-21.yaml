    News of the execution of an unknown man, along with two others, was
    published on the website of the Hamshahri newspaper on September 22, 1997,
    quoting the speaker of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts. Arrest and
    Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The charges against the defendant were announced as "four armed
    robberies and conflict resulting in murder, armed robberies from women's
    hairdressers, companies, and clinics." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment The court condemned the defendant to
    death and he was hanged. The exact date of the execution is unknown.
