    News of the execution of Mr. Rahim, an Afghan citizen, was published on
    the website of the Hamshahri newspaper on October 26, 1997. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The
    trial of this defendant took place in Birjand. Charges The charge against
    Mr. Rahim was announced as "keeping 47 kilogram narcotics." The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed
    based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers
    found in possession of specified amounts (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone) of proscribed
    narcotics. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rahim's defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Rahim to death and, after the ruling was
    confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was executed in Birjand on October 25,
    1997.
