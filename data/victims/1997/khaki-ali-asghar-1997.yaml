    The execution of Mr. Ali Asghar Khaki was announced in the Kayhan
    newspaper on June 19, 1997. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Ali
    Asghar Khaki was announced as “murdering his brother-in-law.” According to
    the Kayhan newspaper, “the defendant [persistently visited] his former
    wife’s family, in order to convince her to remarry him. In spring of 1996,
    he had a fist-fight with his brother-in-law, Naser Pakniyat. When they
    decided to go to the police station, the defendant stabbed Naser with a
    knife, causing his death.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Ali Asghar Khaki’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ali Asghar
    Khaki to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. After
    the ruling was read by an official of the Special Judiciary Complex, he
    was hanged in the presence of the victim’s family at Qasr prison (Tehran)
    on June 18, 1997.
