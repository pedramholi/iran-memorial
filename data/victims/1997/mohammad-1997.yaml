    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad known as Mirza, a resident of
    Abandansar village in Sari, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on March
    27, 1997. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. The trial of this defendant took place in Branch 10
    of the Sari Public Court. Charges The charge against Mr. Mohammad was
    announced as "murdering his wife, Fatemeh, with a knife over family
    disputes." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Mohammad's defense. Judgment The court condemned this defendant to death
    and after the ruling was confirmed by Branch 20 of the Supreme Court, he
    was executed in the presence of the judge, prison officials, and the
    victim's family in the Sari prison yard.
