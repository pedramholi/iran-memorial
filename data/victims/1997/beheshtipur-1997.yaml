circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Beheshtipur, along with another individual, was
    announced in the Kayhan newspaper on March 12, 1997. Arrest and Detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial other than it
    took place in Mashad. Charges The charge against Mr. was announced as
    “murder.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Beheshtipur’s
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Beheshtipur to death and he was
    hanged in the central prison of Mashad. The Kayhan newspaper does not
    report the execution date.
