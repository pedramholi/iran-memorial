    The execution of Mr. Ali Heidarlu, son of Karim, was announced on the

    Charges According to the Hamshahri newspaper report, the charge against
    Mr. Ali Heidarlu was announced as “immoral corruption.” There is no
    explanation about this charge in the report. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ali Heidarlu’s defense. Judgment Mr. Ali Heidarlu was
    condemned to death by the court. After the confirmation of the ruling by
    the Supreme Court, he was hanged at Tabriz prison.
