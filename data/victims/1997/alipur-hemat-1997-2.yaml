    News of the execution of Mr. Hemat Alipur (known as Heimeh), along with
    another person, was published in the Kayhan newspaper, and on the website
    of the Hamshahri newspaper, on July 30, 1997. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The trial of
    this defendant took place in Branch 27 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Tehran. Charges The media reports quoted the Chief Judge of Branch Two
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Khorramabad announcing the charges
    against Mr. Hemat Alipur as "disturbing the public order, spreading
    intimidation and fear among people, undermining public security and
    comfort by demonstration of drunkenness, yelling, hooliganism, moral
    corruption, participation in conflict on June 2, 1997, and insulting the
    religious sanctities." The reports do not explain the conflict on June 2,
    1997. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year
    Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hemat Alipur's
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hemat Alipur as a "Corruptor on
    Earth" to 80 lashes and death, and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme
    Court. On the morning of July 29, 1997, he received the lashes and was
    hanged in public in front of Bakhtar hospital in Shohada square of
    Khorramabad.
