circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Nabi P. was published in the E'temad
    newspaper on September 25, 2005. Several Iranian human rights
    organizations across Europe and North America also reflected the news in
    their publications. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Nabi P.
    was announced as "armed drug trafficking." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment No information is available on the
    detail of this execution. Mr. Nabi P. was hanged in Sari prison. The exact
