    The execution of Mr. Hossein Ashuri and another person was announced in
    the Kayhan newspaper on January 8, 1997. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Hossein Ashuri were announced as “kidnapping, torture,
    harming children, and corruption.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Ashuri’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hossein Ashuri to death
    and he was executed in public in Qa’enat (Southern Khorasan province).
