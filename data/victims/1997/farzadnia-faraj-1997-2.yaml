    Mr. Farzadnia was a family man and a sportsman. He was a retired employee
    of the Ministry of Education, and he was concerned about the rights of
    teachers. Information on the disappearance and extrajudicial killing of
    Mr. Faraj Farzadnia, son of Ma sumeh and Pir Ali, has been gathered from
    Abdorrahman s Boroumand Center s interview with an acquaintance of him
    (February 22 and 28, 2022, and March 4 and 5, 2022). Additional
    information was collected from the Radio Farhang Website (February 1,
    2022) and Center for Parliamentary Research Website (September 7, 1997).
    Mr. Faraj Farzadnia was born on September 1, 1944, in Abadan. He was
    married and he had three children. He had a bachelor s degree in
    Psychology from Esfahan University (ABC Interview, February 28, 2022). Mr.
    Farzadnia was a retired employee of the Ministry of Education (ABC
    Interview February 22 and March 5, 2022). He had been sensitive to
    discrimination and injustice since childhood. Before the revolution his
    political activities consisted of writing articles for publications and
    participating in leftist political meetings. After the January 1979
    revolution, up until September 1980, and at the beginning of the Iran-Iraq
    war, he was the head of Abadan Education Department. At this time, he went
    to war at the front, and stayed there until the liberation of Khorramshahr
    in May 1982. He was injured during this time. Mr. Farzadnia was then
    transferred to Esfahan Area 3 Education Office as the Head of Accounting.
    He was an honest person and was sensitive to the rights of teachers. He
    publicly voiced his opinion on discrimination in teacher gatherings and
    also in family gatherings. For instance, he had said, Why are the children
    of government officials (like Hashemi Rafsanjani) abroad while the country
    is at war? (ABC Interview, February 28, 2022) Mr. Farzadnia was interested
    in sports, especially walking and soccer. He would rent a field so that he
    could organize soccer tournaments for teachers, coaches, and retirees. He
    had a good relationship with his family, particularly with his wife (ABC
    Interview, February 28, 2022). From around 1995, Mr. Farzadnia established
    contact with his wife s sister, who was a member of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in Iraq. In January 1997, Mr. Farzadnia was summoned by
    telephone to the Esfahan Information Office Press Office. According to an
    acquaintance, Mr. Farzadnia would go to the Press Office every morning for
    about a week. He would wait in the waiting room that had no heating , and
    he would go back home in the afternoon, without being told why he had been
    summoned. Mr. Farzadnia finally told the Information Office agents, I am
    not going to come here anymore. If you need anything, please let me know
    in writing. On January 9, 1997, a Peykan car with 4 passengers went to Mr.
    Farzadnia s home. One of the passengers introduced himself as an agent
    from the Esfahan Information Office Press Office and asked Mr. Farzadnia
    to appear at this office at 8am the next day. Mr. Farzadnia s wife asked
    the agent, What has he done? The agent answered, He doesn t need to have
    done anything. We have a few questions for him. (ABC Interview, February
    28, 2022). Mr. Farzadnia had kidney problems (ABC Interview, February 28,
    2022). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to the split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977.
    In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to reorganize the MKO and
    recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution
    and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. (2) Forced Disappearance And
