    Mr. Feizi was described by his friends as courageous, well-spoken, and
    empathetic and as someone who had performed his Party missions with strong
    belief [in the mission] and extremely successfully . Information regarding
    the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Ata Feizi, son of Abdolkhaleq, was
    obtained from a list of the Kudistan Democratic Party members who were
    killed at the hands of the Islamic republic, available on Kurdistan Media
    website, the Party s official website (March 10, 2019), and the Kurds
    residing in America for Democracy and Human Rights website, the Life of a
    Peshmerga (March 12, 2007). Mr. Feizi was born on August 26, 1972, in an
    old neighborhood in the town of Saqez in Kurdistan province. He finished
    his elementary and high school education in that same town but did not
    continue his studies for certain reasons, and started working in a
    mechanic s shop. Mr. Feizi was sent to serve his mandatory military
    service in 1992, but ran away after completing basic training and joined
    the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan in 1993. (The Life of a
    Peshmerga, March 12, 2007). Mr. Feizi was described by his friends as
    courageous, well-spoken, and empathetic and as someone who had performed
    his Party missions with strong belief [in the mission] and extremely
    successfully . (The Life of a Peshmerga, March 12, 2007). The Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan
    (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with the goal to gain autonomy for Kurdistan,
    in north-western Iran. After the Revolution, conflicts between the new
    central Shiite government and mainly Sunni Kurdistan regarding the role of
    minorities in the drafting of the constitution, specification of Shiite as
    the official state religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region,
    ended in armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga
    (the militia of the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1,
    1979, when people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime.
    On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan
    and declared it unofficial and illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke
    out and continued for several months in the region. By 1983, the PDKI had
    lost much of its influence in the region. In the years since various
    leaders of the PDKI have been assassinated. Following internal disputes,
    the party split in 2006 and two organizations were established as The
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, and The Democratic Party of
    Kurdistan. B ackground of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic
    of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of politically
    motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the 1979
    Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the country
    have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of
    individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of
    the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however,
    these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since then, both
    inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far
    identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases there has not been much published and
    the local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
    evidence, and traces obtained through investigations conducted by local
    police and judicial authorities confirm, however, the theory of state
    committed crimes. In certain cases, these investigations have resulted in
    the expulsion or arrest of Iranian diplomats. In limited cases outside
    Iran, the perpetrators of these murders have been arrested and put on
    trial and the evidence presented, revealed the defendants connection to
    Iran s government institutions, and an arrest warrant has been issued for
    Iran s Minister of Information. The manner in which these killings were
    organized and implemented in Iran and abroad, is indicative of a single
    pattern which, according to Roland Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor,
    contains common parameters and detailed planning. It can be ascertained
    from the similarities between these murders in different countries that
    the Iranian government is the principal entity who ordered the
    implementation of these crimes. Iranian authorities have not officially
    accepted responsibility for these murders and have even attributed their
    commission to internal strife in opposition groups. Nevertheless, since
    the very inception of the Islamic Republic regime, the Islamic Republic
    officials have justified these crimes from an ideological an
