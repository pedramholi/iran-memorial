circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Rahim Ali Akbaridust was published in the
    Kayahn newspaper on October 12, 1997. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The trial of
    this defendant took place in Branch 4 of Lahijan court. Charges According
    to the Kayahn newspaper reporter in Lahijan, the charge against the
    defendant was announced as "murdering his wife, Hajar Rakhshandeh, by
    shooting and spraying acid in August of 1997." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Akbaridust's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Rahim Ali Akbaridust to death and he was hanged in the Lahijan prison
    yard.
