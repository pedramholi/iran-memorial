circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Naser Sa’adat, son of Qadamali, along with three
    other individuals, was announced in the communiqué of the Public Relations
    Officer of Esfahan Court and published in the Kayhan newspaper and on the
    website of the Hamshahri newspaper on March 14, 1997. Arrest and Detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial other than it
    took place at the Esfahan Province Court. Charges The charges against the
    defendant were announced as “four counts of kidnapping and committing
    adultery with two of the kidnapped individuals.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence provided against the defendant was his own “confession.”
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. In the case of political detainees, these confessions are,
    at times, televised. The National Television broadcasts confessions during
    which prisoners plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and
    renounce their political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights
    organizations have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by
    those prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available on his
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Naser Sa’adat to death and,
    after the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was hanged in
    public in Shahin Shahr (Esfehan province) on March 14, 1997.
