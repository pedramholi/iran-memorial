circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Azizollah Gholami Nasab was announced in the Kayhan
    newspaper on November 12, 1997. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial other than it took place in Ilam.
    Charges The charge against Mr. Gholami Nasab was announced as “murdering
    Ali Zaman Darabi with a knife in the village of Marbareh in Ilam province
    in April, 1996.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Gholami
    Nasabss defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Azizollah Gholami Nasab
    to death and he was hanged in Ilam prison yard in the presence of the
    victim’s family and the judicial officials.
