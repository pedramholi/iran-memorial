    The execution of Mr. Turaj Ranjbar, along with two other individuals, was
    announced in the Kayhan newspaper on April 16, 1997. Arrest and Detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial other than it
    took place in Branch 24 of the Public Court. Charges The charges against
    Mr. Turaj Ranjbar were announced as “murdering a person and stealing his
    belongings.” The Kayhan newspaper quotes security forces’ report: “[the
    defendant] was acquainted with a person… and went on business with him in
    order to purchase US dollars. On July 8, 1995, after a series of
    activities, he murdered the victim with a sidearm and stole his
    belongings.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ranjbar’s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Turaj Ranjbar to death and, after the
    ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was executed at Qasr prison
    (Tehran) on April 16, 1997.
