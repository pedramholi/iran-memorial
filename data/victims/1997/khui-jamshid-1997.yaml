circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Jamshid Khu’i, known as Jom’eh, was announced in the
    Kayhan newspaper on October 16, 1997. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial other than it
    took place at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Birjand. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Jamshid Khu’i was announced as “drug trafficking.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine, methadone, or morphine). The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on his
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Jamshid Khu’i to death and,
    after the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was executed in
    public in the village of Fandokht in Qayenat county (Southern Khorasan
    province).
