circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Aminollah was published on the website of the
    Hamshahri newspaper on October 13, 1997 and in the Kayhan newspaper on
    October 14, 1997 (quoting the Political and Ideological Office of the
    Security Forces of Kashan, Esfehan province). Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The trial took
    place in Kashan. Charges The charges against the defendant were announced
    as "trafficking 34 kilograms and 200 grams morphine, 18 Kilograms and 940
    grams opium." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defence No information is available on Mr.
    Aminollah's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Aminollah to death
    and, after the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was executed
    in the presence of the victim's family and court officials in the Kashan
    prison on October 12 , 1997.
