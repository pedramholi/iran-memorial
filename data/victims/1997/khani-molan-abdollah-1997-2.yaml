    Mr. Abdollah Khani was intelligent, very active, honest, self-made, and
    very meticulous. He was also a skillful driver. Information regarding the
    extrajudicial killing of Mr. Molan Abdollah Khani, son of Ra na and
    Savareh Ahmadollah Khan, has been collected from an interview with an
    official of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan of Iran (December 8, 2021),
    and an interview with two comrades of Mr. Abdollah Khani in the Party
    (November 16, 2021). News of this killing was published in Shahidan
    website of Democratic Party of Kurdistan of Iran (research date November
    16, 2021) and in the Iran Documentation Center report There is No Refuge
    (August 2008). Mr. Abdollah Khani was born in Sardasht, in Kurdistan
    Province in Iran, in 1949 (Shahidan Website, November 16, 2021). He had 4
    brothers and 2 sisters, and he was single. Mr. Abdollah Khani had lost his
    father in childhood, and he had an elementary school education (Center
    Interview, November 16, 2021). According to an acquaintance of Mr.
    Abdollah Khani, he was intelligent, very active, honest, self-made, and
    very meticulous (Center Interview, November 16 and December 8, 2021).
    Before the Islamic Revolution of January 1979, Mr. Abdollah Khani was
    working with the Kurdish Peshmerga. He joined the Democratic Party of
    Kurdistan of Iran, sometime after the revolution. He left Iran in 1980 and
    settled in Iraqi Kurdistan (Center Interview, November 16, 2021). Mr.
    Abdollah Khani was a skillful driver and he served as a Third Rank member
    of the Financial Commission of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan of Iran.
    In this capacity, he drove a large vehicle and he was responsible for
    purchasing provisions from different towns in Kurdistan of Iraq,
    especially Sulaymaniyah (Center Interview, November 16 and December 8,
    2021). The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) The Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan was founded in 1945 with the goal to gain
    autonomy for Kurdistan, in north-western Iran. After the Revolution,
    conflicts between the new central Shiite government and mainly Sunni
    Kurdistan regarding the role of minorities in the drafting of the
    constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and
    particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in armed clashes between
    the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The
    PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, 1979, when people went to polls
    to vote for or against the Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah
    Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan and declared it unofficial and
    illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke out and continued for several
    months in the region. By 1983, the PDKI had lost much of its influence in
    the region. In the years since various leaders of the PDKI have been
    assassinated. Following internal disputes, the party split in 2006 and two
    organizations were established as The Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan, and The Democratic Party of Kurdistan. Mr. Molan Abdollah Khani
    s Death On June 3, 1997, Mr. Molan Abdollah Khani was driving his large
    vehicle from Sulaymaniyah to the headquarters of the Democratic Party in
    Koy-Sanjaqk. In the vicinity of Khalakan, between Dokan and Koy, he was
    killed by several armed men (Iran Documentation Center, August 2008;
    Shahidan Website; Center Interview, November 16 and December 8, 2021). Mr.
    Abdollah Khani was returning to the headquarters of the Kurdistan Party of
    Iran with provisions from Sulaymaniyah. When he stopped to help a car that
    seemed to have broken down, some armed men attacked and killed him.
    According to the Democratic Party of Kurdistan of Iran investigations, Mr.
    Abdollah Khani had stopped to assist a motorist whose car had apparently
    broken down. He was on his way back from Sulaymaniyah, where he had gone
    to purchase provisions as usual (Center Interview, December 8, 2021). At
    this time, several armed men approached him and shot at his head
    (Interview, November 16 and December 8, 2021). At least one bullet entered
    under his chin and exited his skull (Center Interview, December 8, 2021).
    According to investigations carried out by the Democratic Party, Mr.
    Abdollah Khani s identity card, his gun, and some cash that he carried
    were stolen. The Democratic Party of Kurdistan of Iran has received
    information that shows Mr. Abdollah Khani s identity card was turned in to
    the Ministry of Information agents in Iran (Center Interview, November 16,
    2021 and December 8, 2021). Mr. Abdollah Khani was buried in the Koy
    Martyrs Cemetery (Center Interview, November 16, 2021). Officials Reaction
    There is no information about the reaction of the officials to this
    killing. Reaction of the government of Iraqi Kurdistan State The
    Democratic Party of Kurdistan of Iran reported the killing of Mr. Abdollah
    Khani to the police of Sulaymaniyah and to Asayesh, the Security
    Organization of Kurdistan, in Iraq. There has not yet been any legal
    investigation of this killing (Center Interview, November 16, 2021). Fa
