    News of the execution of Mr. Karim Hosseinalizadeh was published in the
    Kayhan newspaper on August 10, 1997, and on the website of the Hamshahri
    newspaper on August 11, 1997. The reports quote the Head of Public
    Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts describing the defendant's
    background as follow: He became friends with bad people since he was nine.
    In Tabriz, he began to rob and became a professional thief when he was
    fifteen. There are 20 cases filed against him and he spent 13 years of his
    life in prison. According to Kayhan , the defendant had been condemned to
    3 years exile for his crimes but fled his exile location. Arrest and
    Detention According to the Kayhan newspaper, that quotes the Head of
    Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts, after receiving
    several repeated reports by Section 9 of Tehran Police Force about a
    person named Karim Hosseinalizadeh, the Chief of the Judiciary issued an
    order of investigation to the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran. On
    June 9, 1997, he was arrested for creating public fear, intimidation,
    undermining public safety, and battery. The report does not mention who
    filed those "several repeated reports." Trial No information is available
    on the defendant’s trial. The trial took place in Branch Two of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran during extended time. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Karim Hosseinalizadeh were announced as "creating
    public fear, intimidation, undermining public safety, battery, sodomy,
    using and dealing drugs and opium, providing a place to abuse adolescents,
    and spreading corruption in society by pornographic video tapes" ( Kayhan
    ). The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year
    Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the media reports, the
    evidence provided against the defendant consisted of complains made by
    plaintiffs and the statements by the Head of Public Relations of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Courts. He claimed that the defendant escaped from
    Tabriz to Tehran after the revolution and continued his criminal
    activities under the cover of a juice-selling store. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Karim Hosseinalizadeh's defense. Judgment
    According to the Kayhan newspaper, the court condemned Mr. Karim
    Hosseinalizadeh to 20 lashes and death as a "corruptor on Earth." After he
    appealed, the ruling was confirmed by a branch of the Appeals Court. He
    was hanged in the presence of plaintiffs and craftsmen in Evin prison on
    August 7, 1997.
