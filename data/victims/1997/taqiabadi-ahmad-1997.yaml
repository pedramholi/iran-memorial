    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad Taqiabadi, from Nishabur and a resident
    of Mashhad according to the Head of Fars Judiciary, was published in the
    Kayhan newspaper on November 24, and 25, 1997, and on the website of the
    Hamshahri newspaper on August 7, November 24, and 26, 1997. Arrest and
    Detention According to the Hamshahri newspaper, in January of 1997 a
    plaintiff identified the defendant after he kidnapped a 13 year old girl
    in Shiraz. According to the Kayhan newspaper, he was arrested by Shiraz
    security forces. Trial The first session of the trial took place in Shiraz
    Judiciary Complex Number Two on August 5, 1997. It continued in Branch 35
    of Shiraz Public Court. The first session was open but it continued
    afterward in closed sessions. There were 18 defendants in this trial.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Ahmad Taqiabadi were announced as "two
    counts of murder, five counts rape, twelve counts kidnapping, seven
    robberies, and five incidences of fraud, including using falsified
    governmental documents, and keeping inappropriate pictures and movies."
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The Kayhan newspaper quotes the Head of Fars
    Judiciary saying that the defendant confessed to his crimes in Branch Five
    of Shiraz Detective Office. In this trial, three other defendants were
    present as accomplices and 22 people as plaintiffs. Defence According to
    the Hamshahri newspaper, the defendant created "imaginary accomplices" for
    murder and rape and several times named other people as the perpetrators
    of these crimes, and denied the charges of murder and rape in the court.
    One day before his execution, in his talk with the reporters, he explained
    his motivations for wrong-doing as having a disorganized life, futile
    marriages, and having psychological problems. It is unknown whether or not
    this talk with the reporters was the defendant's call. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Ahmad Taqiabadi to seven counts execution, 421 lashes, and
    44 years imprisonment. The Supreme Court recognized him as a "Corruptor on
    Earth" and added another count of execution. According to the Hamshahri
    newspaper, the execution of 421 lashes began a day earlier in Adelabad
    prison. During the lashing, a victim's brother lashed the defendant so
    hard that he was writhing and the lashing had to stop. For this reason,
    the remaining lashes were performed by the security forces. According to
    the same report, when the officials wanted to blindfold the defendant
    before his execution, he resisted and asked to be executed with open eyes.
    But finally the officials blindfolded him. He was executed in public in
    Shohada square of Shiraz on November 25, 1997 at 10 a.m., after he had
    received the last 100 lashes.
