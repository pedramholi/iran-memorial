cause_of_death: "Execution » Hanging"
circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown man, along with four others, was
    published in the Kayhan newspaper on July 16, 1997. Arrest and Detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial which took
    place in the Revolutionary Court of Sarakhs. Charges The charge against
    this defendant was announced as "transporting a large amount of
    narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The court condemned the defendant to death and, after the ruling
    was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was executed in public in Sarakhs
    (Khorasan Razavi province). The Kayhan newspaper does not mention the
    exact date of the execution.
