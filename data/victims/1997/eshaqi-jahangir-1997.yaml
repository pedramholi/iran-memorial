circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Jahangir Eshaqi, along with another individual, was
    announced in the Kayhan newspaper on March 12, 1997. Arrest and Detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial other than it
    took place in Mashad. Charges The charge against Mr. Jahangir Eshaqi was
    announced as “murder.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Eshaqi’s
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Jahangir Eshasi to death and he
    was hanged in the central prison of Mashad. The Kayhan newspaper does not
    report the execution date.
