    The execution of Mr. Mas’ud Hava’eji, along with two other individuals,
    was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on April 16, 1997. Arrest and
    Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial
    other than it took place in Branch 35 of the Public Court. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Mas’ud Hava’eji was announced as “murder.” According to
    the Kayhan newspaper, on March 16, 1995 the burned body of a man was found
    by neighbors on South Andisheh Street. With the presence of the police and
    a special judge, it was disclosed that the victim was murdered in another
    place and his body set ablaze. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence
    provided against the defendant was his own “confessions” and a case in
    Karaj Public Court about his dispute with the victim. During the
    investigation, the victim’s wife said that her husband was in the currency
    exchange business, and had a dispute with the defendant. International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of torture to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Hava’eji’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mas’ud Hava’eji
    to death and, after the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was
    executed at Qasr prison (Tehran) on April 16, 1997.
