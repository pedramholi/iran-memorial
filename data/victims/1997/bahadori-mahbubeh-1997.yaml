    Ms. Bahadori was released from prison during the late 1980s, after the
    mass killings of the summer of 1988. She began to work in Esfahan, where
    she was living. Information on the disappearance and extrajudicial killing
    of Ms. Mahbubeh Bahadori was collected from an interview with one of her
    acquaintances (February 22 and 28, and March5, 2022). News of this
    disappearance and extrajudicial killing was published in Mojahedin Website
    (December 26, 2016) and also in Burning Plain Anemones Weblog (May 2014).
    Additional information on this killing was obtained from Iran Futurism
    Foundation Website (October 10, 2003), Pishtazan Rah-e Azadi Iran Weblog
    (November 5, 2015), Tribune Zamaneh Website (July 29, 2016), Falakhan #58
    (February 2, 2017), and Azadi-e Bayan Website (October 5, 2020). Ms.
    Bahadori was a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and was
    probably arrested and imprisoned in Dastgerd Prison in Esfahan for this
    reason (Pishtazan Rah-e Azadi Iran Weblog, November 5, 2015; Burning Plain
    Anemones Weblog, May 2014). She was released from prison towards the end
    of the 1980s, sometime after the mass killings of the summer of 1988 (1)
    (Mojahedin Organization Website, December 26, 2016). According to
    available information, after she was released, Ms. Bahadori was living and
    working in Esfahan (Pishtazan Rah-e Azadi Iran Weblog, November 5, 2015).
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) The Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of
    Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of
    Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the
    Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic
    and social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. (2) Forced Disappearance And Murder Of
    Ms. Mahbubeh Bahadori On January 10 or 11, 1997, Ms. Mahbubeh Bahadori
    disappeared, probably after going to the Esfahan Information Office Press
    Office. Since agents from this office kept reassuring his family that he
    would be released from this office, they believe he was at the Esfahan
    Information Office Press Office on Kamal Esma il Street, near Enqelab
    Square (ABC interview, February 22 and 28, 2022). Along with Ms. Bahadori,
    several other people were also disappeared at the same place on the same
    day including Ms. Zohreh Mazaheri , Ms. Afsaneh (Parvin) Tahmasebi , Mr.
    Mohammad Aqa Aqa'i , Mr. Ahmad Aqa'i , and Mr. Faraj Farzadnia . Ms.
    Bahadori was a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and she had
    survived the mass killings of the summer of 1988. She was abducted and
    killed by agents of the Islamic Republic Ministry of Information, in
    January 1997. Some sources have written that Ms. Bahadori was abducted and
    killed by Information Office agents, on her way from home to work in
    Esfahan, almost at the same time as two of her friends, Ms. Zohreh
    Mazaheri and Ms. Afsaneh Tahmasebi (ABC s research). According to
    available information, Ms. Bahadori was one of the supporters of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who disappeared during an operation named
    Alghadir. This operation was carried out by the Information Ministry of
    the Islamic Republic, with the goal of kidnapping and killing members and
    supporters of MKO. There is no information on him or on a number of other
    people from Esfahan who disappeared at the same time. Sometime before Ms.
    Bahadori was abducted, thousands of prisoners were executed during the
    mass killings of the summer of 1988. (2) Many of these were considered
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization leaders . According to available information
    and comments made by responsible officials, Ms. Bahadori and the rest of
    the missing people were probably killed by the same logic (Boroumand
    Center Research). Background of Extrajudici
