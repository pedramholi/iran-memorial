    The of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Taru’i and another individual named
    Mehrab Taru’i, was announced on the website of the Hamshahri newspaper on
    November 25, 1997. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial other than it trial took place in the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Birjand. Charges The charges against the
    defendant were announced as “armed clashes, intimidation, drug
    trafficking, and possession of 750 kilograms opium.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, methadone, or
    morphine). The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Taru’i’s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad Taru’i to death and, after the
    ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was hanged in public, in
    Jahad Square of Nahbandan (Southern Khorasan province).
