    Mr. Fazel Khodadad s execution was reported by the Kayhan newspaper on
    November 22, 1995. Further information regarding this execution was sent
    to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center via two electronic forms by persons
    familiar with this case. (e-forms 7/22/2006 3/6/2020) According to the
    newspaper report, Mr. Khodadad was a businessman. His family, especially
    his brother, had close ties with the royal family of the previous regime.
    Before the Revolution, Mr. Khodadad was involved in the import, export,
    and construction business. During the advent of the Revolution, he was
    working on a high-rise that was being built on Fereshteh Avenue in Tehran,
    for which he had received a 30-million tumans loan from the Saderat Bank.
    All of his family s belongings, however, were confiscated after the
    Revolution due to their ties with the royal family and Mr. Khodadad left
    for the United States. He returned to Iran in 1988, after the Iran-Iraq
    War, with the purpose of resuming the high-rise project on Fereshteh
    Avenue and reclaim some of his confiscated belongings. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Khodadad was arrested and detained at Evin Prison. Further
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Mr. Khodadad was tried by Branch 40 of the Penal Court, along with 6
    members of his network. Charges Mr. Khodadad was charged with embezzling
    123 billion tumans from the Saderat Bank after his return to Iran in 1988.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Khodadad s defense. Judgment Based on
    the newspaper account, Mr. Khodadad was declared a corruptor on earth and
    sentenced to fine of 20,277,732,796 Riyal (approximately 2.2 billion
    tumans) and death by Branch 40 of the Penal Court. He appealed his
    sentence, and his case was reviewed by Branch 23 of the Superior Court
    which after hours of deliberation upheld the lower court s sentence. On
    the dawn of November 22, 1995, Mr. Khodadad was taken to the Public
    Prosecutor s office and asked to write his last will and perform the
    necessary religious rites before his execution. He was examined by a
    medical doctor and deemed fit for execution. He was then transported back
    to Evin Prison and hanged. Mr. Khodadad was also sentenced to flogging
    which was implemented right before his execution. (e-form 03/06/2020)
