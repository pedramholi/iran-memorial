    The Islamic Republic News Agency IRNA attributed the attack on members of
    the Mojahedin to a group known as Mobarezin e Iraq . They quoted the
    spokesperson of this group: On Sunday, Mobarezan e Aragh accepted
    responsibility for the May 17 attack on some hypocrites (Monafeqin) in the
    Al Sha ab region of Baghdad. Iraqi fighters want all hypocrites to leave
    Baghdad, and to that end, they will continue these attacks. According to
    this spokesperson, Mobarezin were responsible for the death of Mojahedin.
    The recent attack of Mobarezin e Iraq on the forces of the hypocrites,
    leaving 12 dead and injured, is in line with their aim of the complete
    expulsion of Hypocrites from Baghdad. It is mentioned in the article on
    the terror attack on Ms. Esfandiari and her comrades in Islamic Republic
    Newspaper, Two members of the Hypocrite Central Organization have been
    killed in the north of Baghdad during an armed assault by unknown persons.
    Other news agencies reported, This incident has been called the biggest
    blow in recent years on the high-ranking members of this organization. In
    response to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, who held the Islamic
    Republic of Iran responsible for this attack, some news agencies
    characterized this attack as intra-group differences and opposition to
    feminist movements (feminism in the leadership of the organization). The
    reaction of Mojahedin Khalq Organization In letters to international
    organizations, Mojahedin Khalq Organization attributed the attack on its
    members to the Islamic Republic of Iran. They said, The mercenary gang who
    carried out this heinous murder are connected to one of the most active
    terrorist networks of the Information Ministry of the Clerics Government
    in Baghdad. They were trained as terrorists in Iran and being sent to
    Iraq, they carried out several terrorist attacks on the Mojahedin. They
    named the Deputy Secretary of the Islamic Republic Embassy in Baghdad at
    the time, as responsible for this terrorist group. According to the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, This was the thirty third act of terrorism
    on Mojahedin Khalq, committed in Iraqi territory, by murderous mercenaries
    of the Clerical Governments information ministry. Families Reaction There

    * The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and to recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
