    His bookshop in Isfahan was a gathering place for intellectuals and
    writers. He was neither political nor confrontational, but he had a sharp
    wit and was firm on matters of principle. Mr. Ahmad Mir Ala i, a
    translator, writer, university lecturer, publisher, and journalist, was
    one of the victims of a series of political killings that have come to be
    known as Chain Murders. Information about the life, activities, and murder
    of Mr. Mir Ala i was gathered from published sources* and an interview
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with a person close to
    him. Biography Mr. Ahmad Mir Ala i was born in 1942 in the city of Esfahan
    into a well-educated and cultured family. His paternal grandfather was a
    clergyman, and his maternal grandfather, a physician and a modernist. He
    was a fervent supporter of former Prime Minister Mosaddeq and the National
    Front in his youth (Kelk Monthly, November-December 1995), but he never
    joined any political group and was not politically active before or after
    the 1979 Revolution. He was married and had three daughters. Mr. Mir Ala i
    obtained a Bachelor s Degree in English Literature from Esfahan
    University. He subsequently went to Leeds University in the United Kingdom
    on an academic scholarship and obtained a Master s Degree in English
    Language and Literature. He enrolled in the Ph.D. program in English
    Literature at the Sorbonne (France), but returned to Iran before finishing
    the program. (Gardun, Vol. 1, November-December 1990) Professional Life
    Upon returning to Iran in 1967, Mr. Mir Ala i performed his military
    service in Sistan and Baluchestan Province as a member of the Knowledge
    Corps (Sepah Danesh). In the 1970s, he intermittently taught English
    Literature at Esfahan University, Dramatic Arts University, Esfahan
    Technical University, Arts University, Azad University, and Karachi
    University. He also spent four years at Franklin Publishing House [in
    Tehran] as editor of various literary works. In 1976, he was appointed
    head of the Iran Culture House in India and Pakistan for four years. Mr.
    Mir Ala i began his literary activities in high school where he
    established a literary circle and wrote for a wall newspaper. His first
    translation was published while he was still in college, and he gradually
    became one of the most respected translators of renowned writers literary
    works in Iran. Writers, including Milan Kundera, [Jorge Luis] Borges,
    Octavio Paz, [Gabriel Garcia] Marquez, and [V.S.] Naipaul, were introduced
    to the Iranian audience for the first time through his translations. At
    the time of his murder, Mr. Mir Ala i had published 22 books as well as
    dozens of articles in literary publications. Labyrinths by Jorge Luis
    Borges, Clementis Hat [with the actual title Lost Letters in the novel The
    Book of Laughter and Forgetting ] by Milan Kundera, and Piedra de Sol
    (Sunstone) by Octavio Paz, are among his published translations. The
    Islamic Republic authorities prevented him from publishing some of his
    works, including two volumes of Lawrence Durrell s The Alexandria Quartet,
    the first volume of which was [ordered to be] destroyed after publication.
    (Radio Zamaneh, December 13, 2006) Between 1969 and 1976, in addition to
    being an editor at Franklin Publishing in Tehran, Mr. Mir Ala i was
    editor-in-chief of Ketab e Emruz ( Today s Book ) magazine, Farhang o
    Zendegi ( Culture and Life ) quarterly (a Ministry of Culture and Arts
    publication), Ayandegan e Adabi (a literary publication of Ayandegan
    newspaper) and Jong e Esfahan ( Esfahan Anthology. ) Upon returning from
    India and Pakistan after the Revolution, Mr. Mir Ala i opened in Esfahan,
    the Aftab Bookstore and Publishing House in 1989 and engaged in selling
    books and also publishing them, albeit in a limited way. He also published
    Zendeh Rud Quarterly, a publication specializing in the subjects of
    publishing and translation. His bookstore, the name of which was later
    changed to Zendeh Rud, was one of the few places in Esfahan where
    intellectuals and dissidents could gather and exchange ideas. Mr. Mir Ala
    i s affiliation and contact with the intellectual community and with
    writers, particularly the Iran Writers Association, as well as his efforts
    in confronting censorship made him the target of pressure and intimidation
    by the security apparatus. Mr. Mir Ala i was a member of the Iran Writers
    Association s Advisory Council. ( Yas o Das by Faraj Sarkuhi) He was one
    of 134 writers, signatories of a letter, dated October 15, 1994,
    protesting censorship and the denial of the right to freedom of speech.
    What follows is a passage from this letter: We are writers; that is, we
    write about and publish our feelings, thoughts and research in various
    forms. It is our natural, social and civil right to see our work be it
    poetry or fiction, plays or screenplays, criticism or research work, and
    even translation[s] of other writers work reach our readers freely and
    without restriction. No person or institution, under any pretext
