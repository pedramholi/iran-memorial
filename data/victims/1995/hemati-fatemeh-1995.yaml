    Mrs. Hemati was a supporter of the Mojahedin e Khalq Organization and she
    lived in Semnan. Information about the disappearance and killing of Ms.
    Fatemeh Hemati was published in the Mojahedin e Khalq Organiation of Iran
    Website (July 25, 2015), Thirty thousand Roses of Iran Weblog (September
    7, 2020), Mass Killings of 88 Weblog (November 30, 2015), and Soroush e
    Azadi Website (March 28, 2021). Ms. Fatemeh Hemati lived in Semnan (Thirty
    thousand Roses of Iran Weblog, September 7, 2020). Ms. Hemati and her
    family members were supporters of the Mojahedin e Khalq Organization. One
    of her sons was executed in public in 1982. That same year, her daughter
    in law was killed in an altercation with members of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Guards. Another son of Ms. Hemati was executed in 1984, and
    her daughter and her son in law were executed in the killings of summer
    1988 (1). Another daughter of Ms. Hemati had gone to Iraq and had joined
    the People s Mojahedin e Khalq National Liberation Army. She was killed
    during Operation Chelcheraq, this organization s armed incursion into Iran
    in June 1988 (Mass Killings of 88 Weblog, November 30, 2015). Ms. Hemati s
    husband had died of a heart attack during an argument with the
    revolutionary guards outside Semnan Prison (Mojahedin e Khalq Oranization
    of Iran Website, July 25, 2015; Mass Killings of 88 Weblog (November 30,
    2015). Every year, Ms. Hemati would hold memorial gatherings for her slain
    children. After the execution of her daughter and her son in law in the
    summer of 1988, she would hold these gatherings in the summertime. She was
    arrested and interrogated several times, probably because of holding these
    gatherings (Kojahedin e Khalq Organization Website, July 25, 2015; Mass
    Killings of 1988 Weblog, November 30, 2015; Thirty Thousand Roses of Iran
    Weblog, September 7, 2020). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted
    the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. (1) Disappearance and Death of
    Ms. Fatemeh Hemati Ms. Hemati was probably abducted from her home in
    Semnan, in the summer of 1996, after a memorial gathering for her
    children, her daughter, and her son in law (Mojahedin e Khalq Organization
    Website, July 25, 2015; Killings of 1988 Weblog, November 30, 2015). Some
    sources have written that she was probably abducted by the Revolutionary
    Guards of the Islamic Revolution (Soroush e Azadi Website, March 28, 2021;
    Thirthy Thousand Roses of Iran, September 7, 2020). According to available
    information, Ms. Hemati was an MKO supporter who disappeared within the
    framework of a program within the Islamic Republic s Ministry of
    Information called Al-Ghadir, designed to kidnap and kill MKO members and
    supporters. There is no information regarding her who had fallen into the
    trap the Ministry of Information had set up for them to join the MKO in
    Iraq. Available investigations and research shows that Ms. Hemati and many
    others that were kidnapped under this program, never reached MKO s camps
    in Iraq. A few years before Ms. Hemati s kidnapping, thousands of
    prisoners, including members of the MKO, who were considered to be
    maintaining their [ideological] stance , had been executed in the course
    of the Summer of 1988 mass killings. (2) According to available
    information and the statements of Iranian officials, it is possible that
    Ms. Hemati and others who disappeared were killed on the basis of that
    same logic. (Boroumand Center research). Background of Extrajudicial
