    With no evidence to go on, was sentenced to death on the basis of sworn
    oaths alone News of the execution of Mr. Jonali Hadavand Mirzai was
    published by Keyhan on February 15, 1995. Mr. Hadavand Mirzai was a native
    of Qal ehno village in the jurisdiction of Javadabad, Varamin County,
    Tehran Province. His case pertains to the murder of another resident of
    Qal ehno in the fall of 1989. According to existing information, an
    individual entered the victim s house late at night and killed him with a
    sword inside the anti-insect netting surrounding his bed. In the course of
    investigation, Varamin s county governor and prosecutor sent petitions
    said to have been prepared by residents to judicial authorities and
    requested that the sentence be carried out speedily. Despite this, the
    investigation lasted five years because of a lack of evidence. Two weeks
    before Mr. Hadavand Mirzai s sentence was carried out, the murder victim s
    brother announced that he had been involved in the crime. According to
    reporting from Keyhan, the brother was arrested and questioned after
    making these claims. The investigating judge was convinced that the
    brother s comments were without merit, however, and that he had only
    intended to prevent the execution. Arrest and detention The arrest of Mr.
    Hadavand Mirzai followed a complaint filed against him by the wife of the
    murder victim. Further information regarding his arrest and detention is
    not available. Trial No information is available on Mr. Hadavand Mirzai s
    trial. Charges According to available information, the charge entered
    against Mr. Hadavand Mirzai was murder. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    plaintiff in the case (the wife of the murder victim) claimed that she had
    seen Mr. Hadavand Mirzai fleeing from the scene of the crime. She further
    claimed that he had committed the crime after threatening and quarreling
    with the murder victim. Given Mr. Hadavand Mirzai s denial of having
    committed the murder and the lack of evidence against him, Branch 140 of
    Tehran s Criminal Court One deferred to qassameh to substantiate the
    charge. Defense Through all stages of the investigation, Mr. Hadavand
    Mirzai denied committing murder. He stated in court that he was spending
    the night of the incident at a friend s house. This friend testified in
    court: [Mr. Hadavand Mirzai ] came to my house, ate dinner, and went to
    sleep. I don t know what happened after that. Judgment After
    investigations concluded, the investigating judge issued an indictment
    naming Mr. Hadavand Mirzai as the murderer and requesting a retaliatory
    execution sentence ( qesas-e nafs. ) The court then sentenced him to
    death. Upon Mr. Hadavand Mirzai s appeal the case was taken up by four
    branches of Criminal Court One (145, 146, 147, and 140). Ultimately,
    Branch 140 of Criminal Court One sentenced him to death by conducting
    qassameh. * Following its confirmation by Branch 127 of the Supreme Court
    in Qom, the verdict was sent for implementation. The sentence was carried
    out on February 14, 1995 in Qasr Prison. Mr. Hadavand Mirzai was hanged in
    the presence of the prison warden, Judge Askar, medical experts, and
    family members of the murder victim. ------------------------------------
    * Qassameh means an oath taken by a group of people. It is one of the ways
    that a defendant s guilt or innocence can be proven for both intentional
    and non-intentional offenses. Per Iran s Islamic Penal Code, qassameh is
    carried out in instances where a crime has occurred and no convincing
    evidence or witnesses exist which could prove the defendant s guilt, and
    where a judge has doubt about the defendant s guilt based solely on
    circumstantial evidence a circumstance referred to in religious
    jurisprudence as lowth. Where lowth obtains, the judge is bound to ask the
    defendant to produce evidence disproving the charge. If the defendant
    demonstrates his innocence in this way, he is acquitted. Failing this, the
    plaintiff may perform qassameh in order to prove the defendant s guilt, or
    request that the defendant perform qassameh to disprove the charges. This
    procedure, which requires a defendant to prove his innocence, is contrary
    to the principle of presumption of innocence and violates the defendant s
    right to remain silent. The principle of the presumption of innocence -
    recognized in Iran s constitution, Code of Criminal Procedure, and
    international agreements to which Iran is signatory holds that all persons
    are to be considered innocent until proven guilty. A defendant should not
    be made to prove his own innocence. Proving the charges made against the
    defendant by presenting adequate evidence and witnesses is the duty of the
    prosecuting authority (in the Iranian context, the public prosecutor or a
    private plaintiff.) The right to remain silent is among the defendant s
    rights of defense, affording him the right to refrain
