    ------------------------------------------- * The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, their
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah's regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after many of its members were killed and the purge of other
    Muslim members, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move created a tense and critical atmosphere among the Muslim activists
    and sympathizers of the MKO, and finally led to pronouncement of the
    Marxist-Leninist Section of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1977. In
    January of 1979 the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but their
    efforts to gain political power, either by becoming appointed officials or
    elected by the people, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    authorities. The exclusion of MKO members from government offices and the
    closure of their centers and publishing houses, in conjunction with to the
    Islamic Republic authorities different interpretation of Islam, widened
    the gap between the two. Authorities of the new regime referred to the
    Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi supporters of the regime
    attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during demonstrations and
    while distributing publications, leading to the death of several MKO
    supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a demonstration
    protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the effort to
    impeach their ally, President Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime
    called this demonstration illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of
    whom confronted the Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of
    casualties from the demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    Following that day, the Islamic Republic regime started a repressive
    campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history and thousands of MKO
    members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981, the
    MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and
    assassinated a number of high ranking officials and supporters of the
    Islamic regime over the next weeks and months. In the summer of 1981, the
    leader of the MKO and the impeached President (Abolhassan Banisadr) fled
    Iran to reside in France, where he founded the National Council of
    Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many of its members were expelled
    from France, they went to I
