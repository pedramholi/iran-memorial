    Was only 15 years old at the time of alleged crime News of the execution
    of Mr. Hassan Hassanzadeh was published on the websites of HRANA (January
    18, 2017) and Iran Human Rights (January 26, 2017). Amnesty International
    had issued a call for action to halt this execution on April 17, 2016. The
    case of Mr. Hassanzadeh was related to a murder that happened when he was
    only 15 years old. International laws have strictly prohibited capital
    punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Hassanzadeh
    s arrest are not known. He spent two and a half years in the juvenile ward
    of Central Prison in Tabriz. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Hassanzadeh s trial. Charges Mr. Hassanzadeh was charged with murder . The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Hassanzadeh.
    Defense Mr. Hassanzadeh was only 15 years old at the time of the offense.
    No information is available on his defense. A Summary of the Defects of
    Mr. Hassanzadeh s Legal Proceedings Hassan Hassanzadeh was 15 years old
    when he committed murder. Although the age of criminal responsibility in
    Iranian law is the age of puberty and Hassan had already reached puberty
    at the time of the murder, with the modifications made in the Islamic
    Penal Code in 2013, the law provided for the possibility of young adults
    under the age of 18 not to be subject to the death penalty. Pursuant to
    Islamic Penal Code Article 91 In crimes requiring Hadd or Qesas, if the
    individuals under the age of 18 who have attained puberty cannot
    comprehend the nature of the crime or the prohibition thereof, or if there
    is doubt as to their mental development [and capacity] and maturity, they
    will be sentenced to the punishments prescribed in this chapter on a case
    by case basis. Note: In order to ascertain mental development and
    maturity, the court may obtain the medical examiner s opinion, or utilize
    any other method it deems appropriate. Judicial authorities apparently did
    not believe that Hassan was not mentally developed and mature at the time
    of the murder. Generally speaking, however, an individual at the age of 16
    could hardly be capable of comprehending the nature of his/her actions as
    an adult would. Now that the new law has created the possibility of saving
    the lives of individuals under 18 who have been sentenced to death, why
    are some young people not covered by this law while others lives have been
    spared utilizing the provisions of this Article? Judgment Mr. Hassan
    Hassazadeh was sentenced to death and was hanged at the age of 18 in
    Tabriz Prison on December 29, 2016.
