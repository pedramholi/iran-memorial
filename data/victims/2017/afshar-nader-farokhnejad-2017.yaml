    Boroumand Center s interview with one of his relatives on June 7, 2018
    (ABC interview). The news of this execution was published on Iran Human
    Rights website (August 8, 2017) and the website of Human Right Activist
    News Agency- HRANA (August 9, 2017). Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar was born on
    November 29, 1964 in Bam County, Kerman Provence. H ended his formal
    education after the second year of high school and started working as a
    farmer. Before the Islamic Revolution in 1979, his father was a
    Gendarmerie officer, and after the war between Iran and Iraq began, he
    joined the army and fought on the Kurdish and Ahvaz fronts for three
    years. In 1983-84 Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar s father was arrested for drug
    trafficking and a year later he was executed by firing squad in Kerman.
    After his father was executed, Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar took on
    responsibility for his family. Due to drought and water shortage, Mr.
    Farokhnejad Afshar was forced to change jobs. However, because his father
    had been executed, he was unable to obtain a license and funding from the

    Farokhnejad Afshar lived in the city of Kerman with his wife and two
    children (ABC interview). Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar s case was related to
    drug trafficking . Arrest and detention Early in the morning in April 3,
    2014, agents of the Center for Combatting Narcotics in Esfahan arrested
    Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar. An informant reported drugs hidden in Mr.
    Farokhnejad Afshar s pickup truck, and the agents of the Center for
    Combatting Narcotics arrested Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar at the checkpoint
    near the entrance to the city of Isfahan (ABC interview). Four days after
    his arrest, Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar was allowed to contact his family and
    the first visit with his family took place 20 days after his arrest. After
    a month and following issuance of an indictment against Mr. Farokhnejad
    Afshar, he was allowed to access an attorney. After Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar
    was transferred to the Dastgerd Prison in Esfahan, he was held in the ward
    for Afghans. The interviewee explained that the Dastgerd prison in Esfahan
    was overcrowded and the shortage of space in other wards was the reason
    for Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar s transfer. Trial Branch 2 of Islamic
    Revolutionary Court in Esfahan tried Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar. No additional
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar was drug trafficking . The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the

    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the interviewee, agents discovered
    48 kilograms of hashish (marijuana) in Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar s pickup
    truck. However, according to a report from Iran Human Rights website, 50
    kilograms of opium and 30 kilograms of hashish (marijuana) were discovered

    case was transferred to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the
    execution order and the Pardon and Forgiveness committee rejected Mr.
    Farokhnejad Afshar s request for pardon. Mr. Nader Farokhnejad Afshar was
    hanged in Dastgerd Prison in Esfahan on August 7, 2017. The following day,
