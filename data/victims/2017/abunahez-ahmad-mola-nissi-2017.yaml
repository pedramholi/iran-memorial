    Movement (November 8, 2017), Al-Arabiya (November 10, November 16, 2017,
    and December 27, 2018), Reuters (November 18 and December 18, 2019), The
    Guardian (January 8, 2010), Tabnak quoting Kayhan newspaper (November 12,

    the county of Shushtar. He was married and had four children. According to
    the available information, Mr. Nissi was an Arab political activist and
    the general secretary and founder of the separatist organization "Ahwaz
    Arabic Liberation Movement. In 2005, following several military operations
    carried out by his organization (bombing of oil facilities, armed attack
    on several banks), Mr. Nissi was forced to leave Iran and migrated to the
    Netherlands with his family via Syria. A while later, he obtained his
    Dutch citizenship. He first moved to Maastricht and then, in 2008, due to
    lack of security, he moved to The Hague and lived there for 8 years. Mr.
    Nissi continued his political activities against Iran in the Netherlands,
    organizing demonstrations and conferences. According to al-Arabiya, He
    sought the unification of Sunni groups and organizations, and to that end,
    he had also met with the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria. The
    Syrian Liberation Army also supported the formation of an Ahvaz battalion

    Iran, the Iranian government called him a terrorist and asked Interpol
    police to arrest and return him to Iran (IRNA). According to a media
    report, he sought the unification of Sunni groups and organizations, and
    to that end, he had also met with the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in
    Syria. The Syrian Liberation Army also supported the formation of an Ahvaz
    battalion. (Al-Arabiya English - November 10, 201) Mr. Nissi continued his
    political activities against Iran in the Netherlands, organizing
    demonstrations and conferences. In 2005, following several military
    operations carried out by his organization (bombing of oil facilities,
    armed attack on several banks), Mr. Nissi was forced to leave Iran and
    migrated to the Netherlands with his family via Syria. A while later, he
    obtained his Dutch citizenship. He first moved to Maastricht and then, in
    2008, due to lack of security, he moved to The Hague and lived there for 8
    years. According to a 2017 report by Dutch police in Dutch media, during
    the 10 years he lived in the Netherlands, Mr. Nissi was repeatedly
    threatened and harassed by agents of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He
    reported these incidents to the Dutch police at least seven times, filing
    reports on each occasion, expressing his concerns. In 2010, he was forced
    to leave Maastricht with his family due to these threats. In 2012, he
    reported to the Dutch police that the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence had
    contacted him and felt that he was in danger. In the same year, he
    informed the police that Iranian TV had reported that he was on an
    assassination list. In January 2013, one of his acquaintances also
    confirmed this by appearing at the police headquarters. However, the
    police informed him that there was nothing they could do to keep him safe
    and that he should be careful himself. In 2014, Nissi informed the police
    that he was sentenced to death in Iran and two of his friends had been
    attacked in the Netherlands. His final report to the Dutch police was in
    2016. Some of these complaints were reported to the regional intelligence
    agency (Volkskrant). He told his family in the days leading up to his
    death that he felt like he was being followed on the street
    (Dutch-language website Een Vandaag, Den Haag Centraal). Even a year
    before his murder, an Iranian asylum seeker had also warned the
    immigration services and the Dutch intelligence agency that an
    assassination attempt was planned against Nissi. He had no bodyguard (NL
    Times). In October 2023, following a complaint by Mr. Nissi s family in
    2021/2022, the Netherlands intelligence and security service confirmed it
    had been informed of the dangere to Mr. Nissi s life, but had not brought
    it to the attention of the Prosecutor s Office for investigation (NL
    Times). Ahwaz Arabic Liberation Movement The organization, also known as
    the Al-Ahvaz Group, is a paramilitary organization that seeks
