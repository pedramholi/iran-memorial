    News of Mr. Abbas Sahra i s execution was published on April 13, 2017, in
    the Markazi Province Judiciary s website and by the Islamic Republic of

    obtained from ISNA (April 12, 2017) and IRNA (January 11, 2017, and March
    7, 2017) news agencies and from other sources.* Mr. Abbas Sahra i was 27
    years old, single, and resided in the city of Arak. He had a criminal
    record for having participated in a scuffle that had led to a killing in
    which he had played no role. Mr. Sahra i had spent a year in Arak prison
    for that scuffle, and at the time of the incident he had been released
    from prison for just 10 days by posting a 200-million-Tuman bond. Mr.
    Abbas Sahra i s case is related to the murder of 6 individuals in Arak.
    Based on available information, on the morning of January 11, 2017,
    between 5 and 7 AM, an individual armed with a Kalashnikov fired a few
    shots in his own home and then went to two homes in Football Si-metri
    neighborhood (Ali ebn-e Abitaleb neighborhood) and Taleqani Street in
    Arak, and opened fire on the residents, immediately killing five and
    injuring four people. One of the injured died at the hospital. According
    to the Judiciary s announcement, the individuals killed in the first home
    consisted of a police officer who had played a role in arresting the
    defendant the previous year and his family. The second family was the
    parents of the murder victim. Arrest and detention Mr. Abbas Sahra i was
    arrested Wednesday night, January 11, 2017, by police officers on a street
    in the city of Arak. Reports of 2 shootings had been received by the
    Police 110 Emergency Center that morning. Announcing that they had
    arrested a suspect, the police said they were in the planning stages of
    arresting the principle defendant. Mr. Sahra i s picture and personal
    information were broadcast on the Province television network as the
    perpetrator, in order to be positively identified by the people. Based on
    available information, Mr. Sahra i was turned over to the Arak Criminal
    Investigations Bureau upon arrest in order to be interrogated. Trial On
    Tuesday, March 7, 2017, Markazi Province Criminal Court, Branch One,
    located at Markazi Province Judiciary building on Hepco Street in Arak,
    tried Mr. Abbas Sahra i and his brother as Defendants Number 1 and 2,
    respectively. The two defendants court-appointed attorneys, the [victims ]
    next of kin, one of the injured individuals, the plaintiffs attorneys, and
    a group of reporters were present in the courtroom. Based on available
    information, the trial session started at 9 AM. Upon informing the
    defendants of the charges against them and questioning the latter, the
    next of kin spoke as the plaintiffs. According to the Markazi Province
    Criminal Court, Branch One chief judge, the defendants were given ample
    opportunity to defend themselves. After a one hour recess, the Court
    issued its ruling in that same session. Charges The Judge declared Mr.
    Abbas Sahra i s charges as being 6 counts of intentional murder, carrying
    and possession of firearms, endangering public order and security.
    Evidence of guilt Among the evidence presented against Mr. Sahra i was the
    Medical Examiner s confirmation of the killing of 6 individuals in two
    residences as a result of firing with a Kalashnikov weapon in Si-metri
    Football neighborhood (Ali ebn-e Abitaleb neighborhood) and Taleqani
    Street. One of the injured individuals was present in court as an
    eyewitness. Mr. Abbas Sahra i s statements as well as his brother s, who
    was the other defendant in the case, were also presented as evidence
    against him. Mr. Sahra i admitted that he had shot the victims. His
    brother declared that at Mr. Sahra i s request, he had purchased a
    Kalashnikov weapon along with 105 rounds of ammunition with four million
    five hundred thousand Tumans of his brother s money, and had taken
    delivery of the weapon from the seller in front of their home. At the
    trial session, Mr. Abbas Sahra i stated that he had hidden the weapon in
    the mountains upon his release, and had brought it home on the day of the
    event, and when his brother and mother had objected and tried to prevent
    him from going to the victims home, he had warned them not to follow him
    by firing a few shots, and had left the house armed with the weapon. The
    weapon that was procured was a Kalashnikov along with 105 rounds of
    ammunition, for which I paid four million five hundred thousand Tumans of
    my brother s money, four million of which was paid in cash, and five
    hundred thousand Tumans was paid through debit card transfer to the seller
    s debit card, at which time the seller delivered the weapon to me in Arak
    in front of our home. Defense Based on available information, because of
    the [authority s decision] to quickly take this case to trial, Mr. Abbas
    Sahra i did not have the opportunity to hire an attorney of his choosing
    and had to accept the court-appointed lawyer. In court, Mr. Sahra i
    stated: I admit
