    The news of Mr. Ali Asghar s (last name unknown) execution was published
    by Mizan Online News Agency website on January 9, 2017. Information about
    Mr. Ali Asghar s arrest was obtained from Iranian Students News Agency
    (ISNA) on July 25, 2012. Mr. Ali Asghar s case was related to the death of
    a resident of the city of Dehloran in Ilam province in 1999. In the middle
    of committing a robbery, a man with a covered face shot the home owner
    twice with a hunting gun and fled the scene after taking some jewelry.
    Police questioned persons close to the victim and those who were out of
    favor with him, but no suspect was found at this stage. Since the victim
    was a wealthy businessman, police started investigating his business
    competitors. Among these people, the victim's spouse suspected a tall
    young man named Reza, claiming that his appearance was very similar to the
    assailant. This sole claim was sufficient to make Reza the main suspect of
    the case. Through several years of case investigation, Reza always claimed
    innocence, but since he did not have anyone to confirm his alibi, the
    prosecutor issued an indictment and the judges accordingly found the case
    to be lowth and ordered qassameh * to be carried out. Therefore, 51
    relatives of the deceased s next of kin swore that Reza had committed the
    murder. Despite Reza s claim of innocence, his denial of the charges, and
    his objections to the procedure, Reza was sentenced to a retaliatory death
    sentence ( qesas-e nafs ) on the sole basis of qassameh. A short while
    later, one of those who had taken a qassameh oath against Reza was
    murdered suspiciously, and the investigation s path changed. In the course
    of new investigations, the police turned up a new and surprising lead and
    identified Mr. Ali Asghar, who was involved with both murders. A few years
    after the aforementioned robbery and murder incident, Mr. Ali Asghar was
    arrested on charge of his father's murder and spent several years in jail
    until he was released with the consent of his family and left Dehloran
    permanently for a location unknown to others. Arrest and detention In
    2012, police tracked down and arrested Mr. Ali Asghar in Tehran s Hakimieh
    neighborhood. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Ali Asghar s trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Ali Asghar is not known in detail. According to
    sources, he was charged with robbery and murder. Evidence of guilt In the
    report of his execution, Mr. Ali Asghar's confession and the
    reconstruction of the crime scene were mentioned as evidence against him.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Ali Asghar s defense. Judgment
    According to existing information, the Criminal Court in Ilam province
    issued a death sentence for Mr. Ali Asghar. No further details are
    available on this order. Mr. Ali Asghar was executed subsequent to the
    Supreme Court upholding his death sentence. -------------------------- *
    Qassameh means an oath taken by a group of people. It is one of the ways
    that a defendant s guilt or innocence can be proven for both intentional
    and non-intentional offenses. Per Iran s Islamic Penal Code, qassameh is
    carried out in instances where a crime has occurred and no convincing
    evidence or witnesses exist which could prove the defendant s guilt, and
    where a judge has doubt about the defendant s guilt based solely on
    circumstantial evidence a circumstance referred to in religious
    jurisprudence as lowth. Where lowth obtains, the judge is bound to ask the
    defendant to produce evidence disproving the charge. If the defendant
    demonstrates his innocence in this way, he is acquitted. Failing this, the
    plaintiff may perform qassameh in order to prove the defendant s guilt, or
    request that the defendant perform qassameh to disprove the charges. This
    procedure, which requires a defendant to prove his innocence, is contrary
    to the principle of presumption of innocence and violates the defendant s
    right to remain silent. The principle of the presumption of innocence -
    recognized in Iran s constitution, Code of Criminal Procedure, and
    international agreements to which Iran is signatory holds that all persons
    are to be considered innocent until proven guilty. A defendant should not
    be made to prove his own innocence. Proving the charges made against the
    defendant by presenting adequate evidence and witnesses is the duty of the
    prosecuting authority (in the Iranian context, the public prosecutor or a
    private plaintiff.) The right to remain silent is among the defendant s
    rights of defense, affording him the right to refrain from answering
    questions regarding the charges entered against him. Such silence may not
    be treated as an indication or evidence of guilt or innocence. In order to
    substantiate a charge of homicide through qassameh, an oath is required
    from 50 male relatives of the plaintiff. For the charge to be dismissed,
    fifty male relatives of the defendant must swear to his innocence. Should
