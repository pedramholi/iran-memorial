    in the absence of convincing evidence, was sentenced only on the basis of
    sworn oaths The news of Mr. H. N. s execution was published by Khorasan
    newspaper on May 25, 2017. His case was related to the death of a 73 year
    old man in the city of Mashhad on November 27, 2000. Case investigations
    and the issuing of a retaliatory death sentence ( qesas-e nafs ) for Mr.
    H. N., who was 25 years old when he was arrested, took 17 years. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of Mr. H. N. s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. H. N. s trial. Charges
    According to sources, Mr. H. N. was charged with murder. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. H. N. However, the fact that he was
    sentenced to a retaliatory death sentence ( qesas-e nafs ) on the sole
    basis of qassameh * shows that the evidence against him was not
    sufficiently convincing to prove the charge of murder. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. H. N. s defense. Judgment Due to lack of
    convincing evidence against Mr. H. N., the judges ordered qassameh to be
    carried out. According to available information, 50 relatives of the
    deceased s next of kin swore that Mr. H. N. had committed the murder.
    Investigations went on for 17 years before a death warrant was issued
    Therefore, Mr. H. N. was sentenced to a retaliatory death sentence (
    qesas-e nafs ) on the sole basis of qassameh. The Supreme Court upheld his
    death sentence. At daybreak on Tuesday, May 23, 2017, Mr. H. N. was
    executed under the supervision of the Mashhad Public Prosecutor's sentence
    implementation judges in Mashhad s Central Prison. Mr. H. N was 42 years
    old at the time of his execution. --------------------------------- *
    Qassameh means an oath taken by a group of people. It is one of the ways
    that a defendant s guilt or innocence can be proven for both intentional
    and non-intentional offenses. Per Iran s Islamic Penal Code, qassameh is
    carried out in instances where a crime has occurred and no convincing
    evidence or witnesses exist which could prove the defendant s guilt, and
    where a judge has doubt about the defendant s guilt based solely on
    circumstantial evidence a circumstance referred to in religious
    jurisprudence as lowth. Where lowth obtains, the judge is bound to ask the
    defendant to produce evidence disproving the charge. If the defendant
    demonstrates his innocence in this way, he is acquitted. Failing this, the
    plaintiff may perform qassameh in order to prove the defendant s guilt, or
    request that the defendant perform qassameh to disprove the charges. This
    procedure, which requires a defendant to prove his innocence, is contrary
    to the principle of presumption of innocence and violates the defendant s
    right to remain silent. The principle of the presumption of innocence -
    recognized in Iran s constitution, Code of Criminal Procedure, and
    international agreements to which Iran is signatory holds that all persons
    are to be considered innocent until proven guilty. A defendant should not
    be made to prove his own innocence. Proving the charges made against the
    defendant by presenting adequate evidence and witnesses is the duty of the
    prosecuting authority (in the Iranian context, the public prosecutor or a
    private plaintiff.) The right to remain silent is among the defendant s
    rights of defense, affording him the right to refrain from answering
    questions regarding the charges entered against him. Such silence may not
    be treated as an indication or evidence of guilt or innocence. In order to
    substantiate a charge of homicide through qassameh, an oath is required
    from 50 male relatives of the plaintiff. For the charge to be dismissed,
    fifty male relatives of the defendant must swear to his innocence. Should
    the number of male relatives taking the oath be less than 50, the
    defendant may repeat the oath himself in order to meet the required number
    of swears. In homicide cases, it is not possible for a plaintiff to repeat
    the oath in this way. It is not necessary for those taking the oath to
    have witnessed the commission of the crime themselves. In Hanafi
    jurisprudence, qassameh can only be carried out to disprove charges
    against a defendant, and a plaintiff may not use it to substantiate a
    defendant s guilt. In Shi a jurisprudence, however, qassameh is carried
    out in the first stage by the plaintiff to prove the charges against the
    defendant. Only where the plaintiff foregoes qassameh and requests that
    the defendant perform it himself, can the defendant use qassameh to see
    his charges dismissed.
