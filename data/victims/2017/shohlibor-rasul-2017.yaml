    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC) obtained the news of Mr. Rasul
    Shohlibor s execution through an interview with one of his acquaintances.
    Further information on this case was obtained by ABC through this
    interview as well as from the website of the Baluchi Activists Campaign
    (retrieved on July 21, 2017). Mr. Rasul Shohlibor, 45, son of Seyyed
    Mohammad, was a Sunni citizen from Sistan and Baluchestan. He was married
    but had no children. He was self-employed and had no criminal record. This
    case pertains to drug-related offenses. Arrest and Detention According to
    an acquaintance who was interviewed by ABC, Mr. Shohlibor was arrested in
    his house for a bag that belonged to a house guest, the contents of which
    he did not know. Mr. Shohlibor was imprisoned in Iranshahr Prison for six
    years. The agents told Mr. Shohlibor to contact his family members on July
    21, 2017 and arrange a last meeting with them. He met all his family
    members during that session. According to the Baluchi Activists Campaign,
    the prison authorities moved Mr. Shohlibor to the quarantine in a solitary
    cell on the same date. Trial There is no information on the trial
    proceedings. Charges Mr. Shohlibor was charged with transporting
    narcotics. There are no details available regarding the charge. It is to
    be noted that where even the minimum of proper conditions for a fair trial
    are not met in Iran, and where the accused is refused a fair trial,
    ascertaining the nature of the crimes attributed to the accused is very
    difficult. International organizations that defend human rights have noted
    reports that indicate the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    sometimes falsely attribute crimes such as trafficking narcotics or sexual
    abuse to dissidents, including political, civil rights, syndicalist, or
    ethnic or religious minorities rights activists, and then execute them
    along with other criminals. Every year hundreds are sentenced to death in
    Iranian courts; however, the number of the people who are executed on such
    grounds is not clear. Evidence of Guilt The bag in Mr. Shohlibor s house
    was used as evidence against him. No information is available regarding
    the contents of the bag, and it is not clear whether it contained
    narcotics or not. International organizations defending human rights have
    repeatedly accused the Islamic Republic of Iran for its use of harsh
    systematic torture and solitary confinement to extract confessions from
    prisoners, and questioned the confessions that were extracted from the
    accused under duress. Defense According to the acquaintance who was
    interviewed by ABC, Mr. Shohlibor did not know what was in the bag. Mr.
    Shohlibor was not allowed to use the services of a defense lawyer. No
    information is available on Mr. Shohlibor s defense during the court
    proceedings. Judgement According to an individual with knowledge of the
    case, Mr. Shohlibor was sentenced to six or seven years of imprisonment;
    he was hanged in Iranshahr Prison nonetheless. Since Mr. Shohlibor met his
    family for the last time on July 21 and was then moved to the quarantine
    in a solitary cell, it is probable that he was executed on July 22, 2017.
    According to an acquaintance, Mr. Shohlibor s family members face
    difficult circumstances following his execution and face financial ruin.
