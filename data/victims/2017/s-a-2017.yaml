    News of Mr. A. S. s execution was published by Mehr news agency (January
    29, 2017), Mizan news agency (January 29, 2017), and Khorassan newspaper
    (January 30, 2017). Additional information about this case was obtained
    from ISNA news agency (August 4 and 11, 2016), Jam-e Jam online (November
    27, 2014), Khorassan newspaper (January 31, 2017), and the video broadcast
    on the Aparat website (August 10, 2014). On August 4, 2014, around 6:15
    PM, several masked individuals robbed a jewelry store on the city of
    Neishabur s Imam Khomeini Street. Several citizens called the Police
    (Police 110), and police officers arrived on the scene while the robbers
    were fleeing. The robbers, who had covered their faces and were carrying
    shotguns, got into a shootout with the police during which two civilians
    and a police officer were injured. The robbers were able to flee the scene
    in a white Peugeot and switch cars after they had gotten far enough, thus
    evading capture (ISNA, August 12, 2014). Mr. A. S. was 23 years old,
    married, and resided in Neishabur. According to him, his father s
    financial situation was sound and his mother worked at a health clinic in
    Neishabur. Arrest and detention On the morning of November 27, 2014, four
    months after the jewelry store robbery, Mr. A. S. was arrested in the
    vicinity of Mashhad s Namayeshgah Square by Criminal Investigations
    Police. Based on available information, he and three other men and four
    women were arrested as the defendants in the case (Khorassan newspaper,
    January 30, 2017). Based on available information, Mr. A. S. confessed to
    the robbery during interrogations. He spent two years in prison. Trial Mr.
    A. S. was tried by Mashhad Revolutionary Court, Branch Seven, in the
    presence of his defense attorney. No information is available about the
    details of the trial session/s. Charges Mr. A. S. and another defendant in
    the case were accused of Moharebeh ( waging war against God ) through
    creating fear and terror, and armed robbery . The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt Mr. A.
    S. confession, discovery of 2 kilograms of the stolen gold, discovery of a
    Winchester shotgun, two Peugeot and Pride cars that had been used during
    the robbery, closed circuit camera footage from the store, and testimony
    of three of the individuals injured during the robbery, were among the
    evidence used against Mr. A. S. (Jam-e Jam, November 27, 2014, and
    Khorassan, January 30, 2017). International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. A. S. stated that he had
    participated in the robbery out of youthful enthusiasm stemming from
    watching cops and robbers action movies. Stating that he regretted his
    actions, he said: I am scared and frightened. In the two years that I ve
    been in prison, I have matured 15 years. If I had then the level of
    maturity I have now, I would have never even thought of doing something
    like this (Interview with the Defendant, Khorassan newspaper, January 31,
    2017). No information is available on Mr. A. S. s defense in court. A
    Summary of the Legal Defects in the Adjudication of Mr. A.S. Judicial
    authorities charged this individual with the crime of Moharebeh from the
    time he was arrested. Pursuant to Islamic Penal Code Article 279,
    Moharebeh is drawing a weapon with intent to harm people s lives,
    property, and chastity (or female members of a family), in a way that
    creates insecurity. Furthermore, Article 281 considers as Mohareb, those
    armed robbers who deprive people of their security. On the other hand, the
    Islamic Penal Code s Ta zirat section expressly mentions armed robbery,
    prescribing imprisonment and flogging as punishment therefor. Pursuant to
    Article 652 if harm comes to an individual in the course of theft, or if
    the thief is armed, he/she shall be sentenced to three months to ten years
    imprisonment and to up to 74 lashes; and if injury is caused, in addition
    to the punishment prescribed for injury, he/she shall be sentenced to the
    maximum punishment provided in this article. What this Article shows is
    that the law does not hold that any robbery amounts to Moharebeh; if that
    were the case, there would be no need to enact Article 652 and other
    similar provisions. Theft can be considered Moharebeh when it is very
    extensive and when people have been deprived of their safety and security
    as a result of armed action. In the present case, it can be observed that
    the robbers had no prior criminal record of armed robbery, i.e., robbery
    was not their profession. Further, their goal was solely to steal and no
    weapons were used during the commission of robbery. They had resorted to
    firing their weapons to escape from
