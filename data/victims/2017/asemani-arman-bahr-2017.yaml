    Arman Bahr Asemani was found guilty of murdering his cousin at 16. When a
    legal reform could have spared his life, why did judiciary officials
    insist on hanging him? News of Mr. Arman Bahr Asemani s execution was
    published by HRANA (January 17, 2017) and the Iran Human Rights
    Organization s website (January 26, 2017). Additional information about
    this case was obtained from Mr. Mohammad Ali Jedari Forughi s Facebook
    page (January 14, 2017) and from an ILNA News Agency report (January 14,
    2017). Mr. Arman Bahr Asemani was 20 years old, born on February 11, 1979,
    and resided in the town of Jiroft in Kerman Province. Mr. Bahr Asemani s
    case is related to the murder of his cousin in Jiroft, Kerman Province.
    Mr. Bahr Asemani was 16 years old at the time of the event in question.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Bahr Asemani s arrest and
    detention are not known. Because Mr. Bahr Asemani was under the legal age
    limit, he was transferred to the Correction and Education Center for
    juvenile offenders after his arrest. During his detention at the Center,
    he obtained numerous athletic and cultural certificates of recognition
    (Mr. Mohammad Ali Jedari Forughi s Facebook page, January 14, 2017). Trial
    No information is available on Mr. Bahr Asemani s trial. Charges Mr. Bahr
    Asemani was charged with intentional murder and consumption of alcoholic
    beverages . He was accused of having murdered his cousin in November 2012
    while inebriated. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense The court did not pay attention to the fact that Mr. Bahr Asemani
    was sixteen years old at the time of the murder and under the legal age
    limit. Based on available information, Mr. Bahr Asemani was under the
    influence of alcohol at the time of the event. No information is available
    on Mr. Bahr Asemani s defense. A Summary of the Defects of Mr. Bahr
    Asemani s Legal Proceedings Arman Bahr Asemani was 16 years old at the
    time he allegedly committed murder. Although the age of criminal
    responsibility in Iranian law is the age of puberty and Arman had already
    reached puberty at the time of the murder, modifications made in the
    Islamic Penal Code in 2013 provided for the possibility of young adults
    under the age of 18 not being subject to the death penalty. Pursuant to
    Islamic Penal Code Article 91 [i]n crimes requiring Hadd or Qesas, if the
    individuals under the age of 18 who have attained puberty cannot
    comprehend the nature of the crime or the prohibition thereof, or if there
    is doubt as to their mental development [and capacity] and maturity, they
    will be sentenced to the punishments prescribed in this chapter on a case
    by case basis. Note: In order to ascertain mental development and
    maturity, the court may obtain the medical examiner s opinion, or utilize
    any other method it deems appropriate. Judicial authorities apparently
    believed that Arman was mentally developed and mature at the time of the
    murder. Generally speaking, however, an individual at the age of 16 could
    hardly be capable of comprehending the nature of his/her actions as an
    adult would. Now that the new law has provided for the possibility of
    saving the lives of individuals under 18 who have been sentenced to death,
    why are some young people not covered by this law while others lives have
    been spared utilizing the provisions of this Article? Judgment Mr. Bahr
    Asemani was sentenced to death (Qesas of life, taking of life as
    retribution ) and 74 lashes for consuming alcoholic beverages. Based on
    available information, Mr. Bahr Asemani s defense attorney pointed to the
    contradictions in the court s ruling and stated: If the Court believes my
    client was drunk, then the murder cannot be found to have been
    intentional, and if he was not drunk, then why the flogging sentence?
    (Iran Human Rights Organization website, January 26, 2017). According to
    Mr. Bahr Asemani s brother, on January 12, the defendant was transferred
    from prison for the sentence to be implemented; however, the family was
    given one week to obtain the next of kin s forgiveness while the legal
    formalities were being completed. Based on available information, Mr. Bahr
    Asemani s family asked two other lawyers to assist them in obtaining the
    murder victim s family s forgiveness (ILNA, January 14, 2017). Based on
    available information, between two and four o clock in the morning of
    January 15, 2017, as part of their ongoing efforts, the attorneys
    conducted a settlement meeting in one of the attorney s homes with members
    of the defendant s and the victim s families and other well-meaning
    individuals, hoping they would be able to obtain the next of kin s
    forgiveness. According to individuals present at that meeting,
    negotiations to obtain forgiveness and settle the matter were also being
    conducted between the families at another location. At 4 AM, the lawyers
    went to Kerman Prison. At around 6 AM, another settlement meeting
