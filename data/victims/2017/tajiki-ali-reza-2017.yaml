    A 15-year-old religious young man of rather small stature; he held a
    ranking in cycling in Fars Province News of Mr. Alireza Tajiki s execution
    was published on August 10, 2017, by numerous sources including Radio
    Farda, Manoto TV, and HRANA News Agency. Additional information in this
    case was obtained through Boroumand Foundation research and an interview
    with a person with knowledge of the case, and from documents related to
    the case, available at Boroumand Foundation, and from Amnesty
    International s communiqu s (May 18, 2016, August 3, 2016, August 9, and
    10, 2017), Mizan and Ana News Agency (August 10, 2017), HRANA (August 9,
    2017), Voice of America (August 10, 2017), Radio Farda (August 10, 2017),
    Deutsche Welle (May 26, 2016 and July 31, 2016) Worldwide Movement for
    Human Rights website (August 1, 2016). Mr. Alireza Tajiki, child of
    Rajabali, was born on May 26, 1996, in the town of Fasa in Fars Province.
    He had a number of siblings and his father was a gardener at the Fasa
    Water Administration. He was a high school freshman, a religious young man
    of rather small stature, member of the mosque s cycling team, and held a
    ranking in cycling in the Province. Based on available information, Mr.
    Tajiki began to stutter after a traumatic experience when he was in second
    grade, and received treatment for a while (Boroumand Foundation interview
    with a person with knowledge of the case). Based on available information,
    he spent a few years at the Reform and Education Center and was trusted by
    the people in charge there. He taught other kids the Koran while studying
    there and obtained a professional degree. Mr. Tajiki s case is related to
    the rape and murder of his close 16-year-old friend on May 18, 2012.
    Iranian judicial authorities intended to carry out Mr. Tajiki s death
    sentence on two separate occasions (May 15, 2016, and August 3, 2016) but
    each time the execution was postponed due to international and Iranian
    civil society protests. The possibility that Mr. Tajiki would be executed
    attracted much public attention inside and outside Iran and caused
    international human rights organizations, the United Nations, and several
    foreign governments to try on several occasions to prevent his execution.
    They succeeded twice. The day prior to the implementation of the sentence,
    the international community expressly asked Iranian authorities to halt
    his execution (Amnesty International Iran Section researcher s interview
    with Voice of America, August 10, 2017, and the German Government s
    communiqu , May 26, 2016). Arrest and detention Based on available
    evidence, Mr. Tajiki was arrested on July 3, 2012 at the age of 15, after
    having been summoned to the Criminal Investigations Bureau several times.
    Mr. Tajiki was summoned to help the police investigations after the
    discovery of his friend s body in a well in the village of Gardsar. Mr.
    Tajiki had been summoned to the Fasa Criminal Investigations Bureau on
    that day, along with a number of the victim s other friends, when he was
    arrested without his family s knowledge. Several other people were
    arrested in connection with the murder. Based on available information,
    Mr. Tajiki was kept in solitary confinement for 15 days without access to
    his family or an attorney, where the interrogators forced him to make a
    self-incriminating confession under pressure and torture through beating,
    flogging, and suspension by the hands and feet (Amnesty International, May
    18, 2016 and August 10, 2017). According to a person with knowledge of the
    case quoting Mr. Tajiki, the interrogator tortured him by tying his hands
    and feet and suspending him upside down, stripping him and lighting a
    lighter under his testicles, and beating him with a cable. According to
    this defendant, they beat him so much during interrogations that he would
    pass out and they would revive him by pouring a bucket of water on his
    head, and would tell him This is how it s going to be if you don t confess
    (Boroumand Foundation interview with a person with knowledge of the case).
    Based on available information, after much pressure and torture, Mr.
    Tajiki was forced to re-create the scene of the crime, with the
    interrogators leading him to say what they wanted him to say. According to
    a person with knowledge of the case, on July 16, 2012, after two days of
    rehearsal in the presence of the Criminal Investigations Bureau agents,
    Mr. Tajiki reconstructed the scene of the crime in front of the
    investigating judge. He was under torture at the Criminal Investigations
    Bureau for 15 days, without access to his family or to an attorney Based
    on available information, after spending over three months being
    interrogated at the Criminal Investigations Bureau, during which he had no
    access to a lawyer and was not allowed to contact his family, Mr. Tajiki
    was taken to Fasa Prison for 20 days, and thereafter, he was taken to
    Shiraz Reform and Education Center where he spent five years. He then
    spent less than a year at Shiraz Adelabad
