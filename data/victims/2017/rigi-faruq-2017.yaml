    The life of Faruq Rigi was profoundly altered by the extrajudicial
    execution of one of his uncles, which ultimately led him to embark on a
    path of struggle that resulted in his untimely death at the age of 17.
    Information about the extrajudicial execution of Mr. Abubakr Rigi Shafa,
    son of Abdolghani, from Zahedan, married with who children, was obtained
    from an interview by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with an informed
    source on two different occasions (10 September 2021 and 10 October 2023).
    To obtain background information about this case, additional information
    has been taken from IRNA News Agency (28 August 2014), Fars News Agency
    (29 August 2014) and from the websites of Persian Al-Arabiya (20 May
    2014), Al-Monitor (2017), the report of Minority Rights Group
    International (2018), the report of the organization Human Rights Watch
    (1997), CNN, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian's interview with Fareed Zakaria (17
    January 2024), as well as from the Instagram social network page of
    Abdolghani Rigi, father of Faruq and Abubakr Rigi, (20 April 2021). Mr.
    Rigi was born in 1995 into a Sunni Baluch family. He completed his primary
    education in Iran and in 2003, due to the activities of his uncle
    Abdolmalek Rigi and the threats to his family members, he was forced to
    leave Iran and immigrate to Pakistan. Mr. Rigi continued his education in
    Pakistan and earned a high school diploma (ABC Interview with an informed
    source on 10 September 2021 and 10 October 2023). In 2013, Mr. Abubakr
    Rigi, together with others, including his uncle Mr. Abdolra uf Rigi ,
    founded the Jeish al-Nasr organization. This organization, which split off
    from Jeish al-Adl, merged back into that same organization after some
    time. Mr. Rigi was a member of the Jeish al-Adl organization (ABC
    Interview with an informed source on 10 September 2021). The Situation of
    Iran s Baluch Population The Baluch ethnicity makes up one to three
    percent of the country s population and the majority in Sistan and
    Baluchistan, where 64-77 percent of residents live below the poverty line.
    Despite having abundant gas, oil, gold, and marine resources,
    approximately two thirds of residents lack access to clean drinking water.
    Economic policies have allowed and caused Sistan and Baluchistan Province
    to remain one of the most deprived provinces in terms of education,
    health, and food (Boroumand Center research). Iran's Baluch minority are
    mostly Sunni Muslims, whereas the majority of Iran s population are Shi'a
    Muslims. Policies and actions from authorities have been restrictive
    toward the practice of Sunni Islam, e.g. limiting and even blocking the
    construction of Sunni mosques in majority-Sh ia areas (including Tehran),
    arbitrary closure of Sunni prayer halls and celebratory gatherings, and
    violence from security forces towards groups of Sunnis praying in public
    (Minority Rights Group; Human Rights Watch: Religious Minorities;
    Al-Monitor). Baluch activists have reported that government repression of
    Sunni Baluch groups had increased since February 1994, when locals
    gathered at Zahedan, the capital of Sistan-Baluchistan, to protest the
    destruction of a Sunni mosque in Mashhad. Government agents reportedly
    fired shots into the crowd and detained several activists. Over the years,
    several religious and political personalities inside and outside the
    country have been killed, including four Sunni clerics, who died under
    suspicious circumstances between 1993 and 1995-96. (Boroumand Center and
    United Nations research; Baluch Campaign article, February 14, 2016). Some
    Baluch opponents consider the emergence of armed opposition groups to be
    the result of the central government s policies, including the repression
    of religious as well as peaceful civil activities (1), and being denied
    access to jobs (Boroumand Center research; Minority Rights Group).
    Jeish-al-Nasr, Jeish-al-Adl, Jondollah The Jeish al-Nasr group was a group
    that had split from a similar group called Jeish al-Adl, which itself had
    replaced a group called Jondollah, an armed ethnic-religious group opposed
    to the Islamic Republic. Jondollah, which had identified itself as the
    defender of Iran s Baluch population s religious and ethnic rights, had
    engaged in several skirmishes with the Islamic Republic military and law
    enforcement forces, each time resulting in a number of casualties on both
    sides. In the course of these conflicts and in order to secure the release
    of Jondollah Prisoners, the group even took border patrol forces hostage.
    After the kidnapping of Abdolmalek Rigi (Abdolmajid Rigi), leader of
    Jondollah, in 2009, and his execution on June 20, 2010, several of
    Abdolmalek s comrades (including his brother, Abdolra uf Rigi) formed the
    Jeish al-Adl group in 2012-13. Jeish al-Adl declared itself the
    ideological heir to Jondollah, an Islamic movement loyal and obligated to
    Islamic values, with defending Iran s adherents of Sunni Islam and the
    downfall of the Islamic Republic as two of its stated goals. (2) After ta
