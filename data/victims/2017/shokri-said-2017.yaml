    Mr. Shokri was 26 years old, single, and without a prior criminal record.
    Information regarding the execution of Mr. Sa'id (Behruz) Shokri, son of
    Mohammad Reza, was published by HRANA, the news arm of the Human Rights
    Activists in Iran (February 13, 2017). Additional information about this
    case was obtained from the Court Decision issued by the [City of] Qom
    Revolutionary Court, Branch One (July 20, 2014). Mr. Shokri was born in
    1990, and was from and resided in the city of Qom. He was single and had
    an [automobile showroom. (Court Decision, July 20, 2014). Arrest and
    detention Mr. Shokri was arrested by the Combatting Narcotic Drugs Police
    officers on April 9, 2014, as he was entering the city of Qom from Tehran
    in a sedan vehicle. (Court Decision, July 20, 2014). He was incarcerated
    until February 2017, and spent a portion of this time in Qom s Langrood
    Prison. Mr. Shokri visited with his family at this prison on February 12,
    2017, for the last time. (HRANA, February 13, 2017). Trial On July 16,
    2014, the Qom Revolutionary Court, Branch One, tried Mr. Shokri s case.
    Mr. Shokri was represented by an attorney of his choice at trial. (Court
    Decision, July 20, 2014). Charges The charge brought against Mr. Shokri
    was stated to have been the purchase and transportation of one kilogram
    and five hundred and ten grams (approximately 3.5 pounds) of heroin .
    (Court Decision, July 20, 2014). The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offenses, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The evidence used against Mr. Shokri was stated to have been Mr.
    Shokri s and his co-defendant s statements made in the course of
    questioning before the Investigative Judge, parts of his confession made
    at trial, covert investigations conducted into Mr. Shokri s narcotic drugs
    activities , and the memorandum regarding the discovery of the narcotics,
    the weighing thereof, and the result of the laboratory testing of the
    drugs [to ascertain its nature] by the Identity Determination
    Administration . Defense At trial, Mr. Shokri denied the [charge of]
    purchasing narcotic drugs and stated: I admit that I received the heroin.
    I admit that I sold the car. But that had to do with a year prior [to
    that]. I did not spend [the money from the sale of the car] to purchase
    drugs I had financial problems [at the time]. They were supposed to pay me
    [for transporting drugs]. I did [transport narcotic drugs], but I did not
    know it was a crime. I don t have a criminal record. (Court Decision, July
    20, 2014). According to a source close to the family, Mr. Shokri s
    attorney was not given an opportunity to resort to Article 477 of the Law
    on the Rules of Criminal Procedure (1) for a de novo hearing on remand.
    According to this source, they had mockingly told [his attorney] to attend
    his client s funeral services the next day . (HRANA, February 13, 2017).
    The Court Decision alludes to Mr. Shokri s last defense and to the defense
    presented by his attorney at trial; the content of the defense presented
    has not been stated, however. There is, therefore, no information
    regarding Mr. Shokri and his attorneys other defense. Judgment The Qom
    Islamic Revolutionary Court, Branch One, sentenced Mr. Sa'id (Behruz)
    Shokri to death for the purchase and transportation of one kilogram and
    five hundred and ten grams of heroin . Mr. Sa'id (behruz) Shokri and six
    other individuals were executed at 6 o clock in the morning of February
    13, 2017, at Qom s Langrood Prison. (HRANA, February 13, 2017).
