    Details about the execution of Mr. Qaderi Moradi, a member of PDKI
    (Iranian Kurdistan Democrat Party), were released in a 1995 report by
    Amnesty International. Arrest and detention The accused was arrested near
    the village of Kohlah in the region of Javanrud in July 1992 and was
    reportedly tortured in detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Before the news of Mr. Moradi's execution was known,
    Amnesty International wrote to the Iranian authorities in February 1994
    requesting information about his legal situation, including whether he was
    tried, the charges brought against him, and asking if copies of the trial
    transcript and judgment could be obtained, if he was indeed tried. Amnesty
    International made the same request in April 1994. By April 1995, Amnesty
    had not received any response from the Iranian authorities. Charges The
    charges brought against the victim are not known. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Moradi's defense. Judgment Mr. Moradi was sentenced to
    death; the exact date of his execution, however, is not known.
