cause_of_death: "Extrajudicial Execution"
circumstances: >
    The information about the extra-judicial of Mr. Ghafur Hamzeh'i was
    published in a 1995 Amnesty International report: "Ghafur Hamzeh'i" was
    shot dead outside his home in Baghdad." The Iranian authorities reportedly
    denied any responsibility for the shooting and said the killing was the
    result of political infighting among "the rebels." However, Amnesty
    International reports that "Minister of Information and Security,
    Hojatoleslam Ali Fallahian, had reportedly said on Tehran television, 'We
    have been able to deal blows to many of the mini-groups outside the
    country and on the borders. As you know, one of the active mini-groups is
    the Kurdistan Democratic Party, which operates through two groups, the
    main group and the auxiliary branch, in Kurdistan. There is also Komeleh
    [Komala]. We were able to deal vital blows to their cadres last year. The
    main and auxiliary organizations of both KDP and Komeleh were dealt severe
    blows and their activities were reduced'." "Amnesty International includes
    in its definition of extrajudicial executions the killing of specific
    individuals which can reasonably be assumed to be the result of government
    policy at any level." Arrest and detention The victim was not arrested.
    Trial The victim was not summoned before a court and no public trial was
    held in his case. It is not known whether he was tried in abstentia.
    Charges No specific charges were brought against the victim. Defense Mr.
    Hamzei was not given the opportunity to defend himself before being
    killed. Judgment The judgment, if any, was not made public.
