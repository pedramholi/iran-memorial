    Details about the execution of Mr. Bahman Khosravi, a member of PDKI
    (Iranian Kurdistan Democrat Party), were released in a 1995 report by
    Amnesty International. Arrest and detention The accused was arrested near
    the village of Kohlah in the region of Javanrud in July 1992 and was
    reportedly tortured in detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Before the news of Mr. Khosravi's execution was leaked,
    Amnesty International wrote to the Iranian authorities in February 1994
    requesting information about his legal situation, including whether he was
    tried, the charges brought against him, and asking if copies of the trial
    transcript and judgment could be obtained, if he was indeed tried. Amnesty
    made the same request in April of 1994. By April 1995, Amnesty had not
    received any response from the Iranian authorities. Charges The charges
    brought against the victim are not known. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Khosravi's defense. Judgment Mr. Khosravi was sentenced to death; the
    exact date of his execution, however, is not known.
