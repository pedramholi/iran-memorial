    Mr. Gabriel Buttini was one of 85 victims of the AMIA (Asociación Mutual
    Israelita Argentina) bombing that took place in Buenos Aires, Argentina on
    July 18, 1994. At approximately 9:05 in the morning, a van containing 275
    kilograms of explosives detonated on Noreguy Street, destroying the
    headquarters of AMIA and damaging surrounding buildings, while also
    injuring 151 people. The victims included passersby and occupants of the
    surrounding buildings. AMIA, a mutual aid society, was one of the most
    visible Jewish organizations in Argentina. It was the largest bombing in
    the history of Argentina and the deadliest attack on Jews since the end of
    World War II. The bombing came on the heels of a similar attack against
    the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in March of 1992, which killed 29
    people. Mr. Buttini was an electrician working on AMIA’s building
    renovations. He was a handyman. He built toys for his two daughters, he
    decorated his own house, and he even repaired his sister’s semi-destroyed
    car. Mr. Buttini was also emphatic in his belief that all people were
    equal, regardless of race or religion. He would tell his children, “People
    don’t realize that when we leave this earth we all go to the same place;
    we’ll be judged by the same God.” He loved his family and would plan short
    vacations and surprise his daughters. His wife says, “His biggest pride
    was to go out with the girls and be told: ‘Oh, your girls are so
    beautiful!’” Mr. Buttini is in Omid because of the overwhelming evidence
    linking Iran to the bombing. The facts surrounding the bombing are
    contained in the report of the official investigation, “Unidad Fiscal de
    Investigación: Causa Amia” , October 25, 2006, Ministerio Público de la
    Nación (Fiscal Investigation Unit: AMIA). The Argentine government’s
    finding were confirmed when INTERPOL authorized the issuance of arrest
    warrants for six of the suspects involved, including a number of
    high-ranking Iranian officials. The six individuals were Imad Fayez
    Mughniyah, Ali Fallahian, Mohsen Rabbani, Ahmad Reza Asghari, Ahmad Vahidi
    and Mohsen Rezai. Fallahian was Iran’s Minister of Intelligence during
    this time period, while Rezai was head of the Revolutionary Guards.* After
    the bombing, the Argentine government launched an investigation led by
    Judge Jose Galleano. From the outset, the investigation was woefully short
    of resources and governmental support. Though Galleano eventually charged
    several people with the bombing, his investigation was ineffective and
    marred by so many irregularities that the most prominent victims’ group,
    Memoria Activa , filed suit with the Inter-American Commission of Human
    Rights of the Organization of American States on July 16, 1999, accusing
    the Argentine government of failure to prevent the bombing and abdicating
    its responsibilities to the victims to pursue justice in the case. This
    was followed with Galleano’s removal from the case in 2004. Though Iran
    has used Galleano’s dismissal as confirmation that its role in the bombing
    was fabricated as part of a cover-up, the evidence clearly illustrates
    that Galleano’s motive was not to frame Iran, but to prevent a thorough
    investigation that would bring to light unflattering facts concerning
    corruption within the highest reaches of Argentina’s government. After
    Galleano’s removal, Alberto Nisman was brought in as the chief
    investigator. Starting anew with greater resources and increased support
    from President Néstor Kirchner, Nisman was able to conduct an
    investigation thorough and credible enough to obtain INTERPOL approval for
    international arrest warrants. Iran’s primary motivation was Argentina’s
    decision to stop nuclear aid to Iran and reorient its foreign policy
    towards the United States (which included sending warships in support of
    the United States-led coalition in the first Gulf War). Other contributing
    factors were Argentina’s ineffectual response to the 1992 bombing of the
    Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, and Syrian anger over Argentina’s
    decision to end cooperation on a joint missile program (which helps
    explain Hezbollah’s role in the bombing, since Lebanon’s Hezbollah
    operates under Iran and Syria’s control). According to the investigations,
    the decision to carry out the bombing was taken at the highest levels of
    the Islamic Republic. A special committee consisting of Supreme Leader Ali
    Kamenei, President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Intelligence Minister Ali
    Fallahian, and other high-ranking officials, met in Mahshad, Iran on
    August 14, 1993 to authorize and plan the bombing. Overall responsibility
    for the operation was conferred upon Fallahian and Ahamad Vahidi,
    commander of a special branch of the Islamic Republican Guards. The
    bombing was carried out in Argentina by a group of Hezbollah agents with
    the help of Iranian diplomats stationed at the embassy in Buenos Aires.
    The Hezbollah operatives, led by Imad Mughnieh, arrived in Buenos Aires
    with fake European passports on July 1, 1994. A flurry of phone calls f
