    Mr. Martín Figueroa was one of 85 victims of the AMIA (Asociación Mutual
    Israelita Argentina) bombing that took place in Buenos Aires, Argentina on
    July 18, 1994. At approximately 9:05 in the morning, a van containing 275
    kilograms of explosives detonated on Noreguy Street, destroying the
    headquarters of AMIA and damaging surrounding buildings, while also
    injuring 151 people. The victims included passersby and occupants of the
    surrounding buildings. AMIA, a mutual aid society, was one of the most
    visible Jewish organizations in Argentina. It was the largest bombing in
    the history of Argentina and the deadliest attack on Jews since the end of
    World War II. The bombing came on the heels of a similar attack against
    the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in March of 1992, which killed 29
    people. Mr. Figueroa was an electrician, and he worked at AMIA building’s
    renovations. He had been married for 25 years, and had six children. He
    worked hard to help others find jobs, medicine, and food. He was at the
    AMIA building on the day of the bombing to pick up his payment for the job
    he had recently completed. Mr. Figueroa is in Omid because of the
    overwhelming evidence linking Iran to the bombing. The facts surrounding
    the bombing are contained in the report of the official investigation,
    “Unidad Fiscal de Investigación: Causa Amia” , October 25, 2006,
    Ministerio Público de la Nación (Fiscal Investigation Unit: AMIA). The
    Argentine government’s finding were confirmed when INTERPOL authorized the
    issuance of arrest warrants for six of the suspects involved, including a
    number of high-ranking Iranian officials. The six individuals were Imad
    Fayez Mughniyah, Ali Fallahian, Mohsen Rabbani, Ahmad Reza Asghari, Ahmad
    Vahidi and Mohsen Rezai. Fallahian was Iran’s Minister of Intelligence
    during this time period, while Rezai was head of the Revolutionary
    Guards.* After the bombing, the Argentine government launched an
    investigation led by Judge Jose Galleano. From the outset, the
    investigation was woefully short of resources and governmental support.
    Though Galleano eventually charged several people with the bombing, his
    investigation was ineffective and marred by so many irregularities that
    the most prominent victims’ group, Memoria Activa , filed suit with the
    Inter-American Commission of Human Rights of the Organization of American
    States on July 16, 1999, accusing the Argentine government of failure to
    prevent the bombing and abdicating its responsibilities to the victims to
    pursue justice in the case. This was followed with Galleano’s removal from
    the case in 2004. Though Iran has used Galleano’s dismissal as
    confirmation that its role in the bombing was fabricated as part of a
    cover-up, the evidence clearly illustrates that Galleano’s motive was not
    to frame Iran, but to prevent a thorough investigation that would bring to
    light unflattering facts concerning corruption within the highest reaches
    of Argentina’s government. After Galleano’s removal, Alberto Nisman was
    brought in as the chief investigator. Starting anew with greater resources
    and increased support from President Néstor Kirchner, Nisman was able to
    conduct an investigation thorough and credible enough to obtain INTERPOL
    approval for international arrest warrants. Iran’s primary motivation was
    Argentina’s decision to stop nuclear aid to Iran and reorient its foreign
    policy towards the United States (which included sending warships in
    support of the United States-led coalition in the first Gulf War). Other
    contributing factors were Argentina’s ineffectual response to the 1992
    bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, and Syrian anger over
    Argentina’s decision to end cooperation on a joint missile program (which
    helps explain Hezbollah’s role in the bombing, since Lebanon’s Hezbollah
    operates under Iran and Syria’s control). According to the investigations,
    the decision to carry out the bombing was taken at the highest levels of
    the Islamic Republic. A special committee consisting of Supreme Leader Ali
    Kamenei, President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Intelligence Minister Ali
    Fallahian, and other high-ranking officials, met in Mahshad, Iran on
    August 14, 1993 to authorize and plan the bombing. Overall responsibility
    for the operation was conferred upon Fallahian and Ahamad Vahidi,
    commander of a special branch of the Islamic Republican Guards. The
    bombing was carried out in Argentina by a group of Hezbollah agents with
    the help of Iranian diplomats stationed at the embassy in Buenos Aires.
    The Hezbollah operatives, led by Imad Mughnieh, arrived in Buenos Aires
    with fake European passports on July 1, 1994. A flurry of phone calls from
    the airport traced them to Foz de Iguazu in the Tri-Border Area, a loosely
    governed region bordering Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, that has become
    a danger point for terrorism. From the evidence gathered, two Iranian
    diplomats in Buenos Aires actively assisted Hezbollah. Mohsen Rabbani, who
    was in charge of the operation, was
