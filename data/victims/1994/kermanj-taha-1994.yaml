    He was very interested in writing plays, in the theater, and in acting. He
    wrote and produced several plays about the sufferings of the Kurdish
    people. News and information about the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Taha
    Kermanj, son of Jafar and Kaleh, has been collected from an Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center interview with one of his relatives (October 26 and
    December 12, 202; June 25, 2022), and from Merhaba Newspaper, Turkiye
    (January 7, 1994). Additional information has been gleaned from an
    interview with Mr. Kermanj s friend (October 26 and December 15, 2021) and
    from the biography of Mr. Kermanj, published in Shahid Website of the
    Kurdistan Democratic Party (no date). Mr. Kermanj was Kurdish. He was born
    on March 7, 1959, in the town of Naqadeh, Western Azerbaijan Province. He
    was married, and he had five children. Before the revolution, he was a
    student in the Naqadeh Technical-Vocational High School. During the last
    year of high school, around the time of the success of the Islamic
    Revolution, he dropped out because he had started to participate in
    political activities. In February 1978, as opposition against the Pahlavi
    regime was picking up momentum, he became politically active by joining
    these protests and demonstrations. After the Kurdistan Democratic Party of
    Iran started their overt activities in the Kurdish regions of Iran, he
    contacted this party in 1978. He officially joined the Party in the spring
    of 1979, in the town of Naqadeh. From 1982-1985, he was a member of the
    Party Committee in the town of Naqadeh. In February 1986, Mr. Kermanj was
    transferred to the Educational and Political Center of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party of Iran. He taught Party history and Kurdish language to
    new recruits, up until 1989 (Shahid Website, no date). The Kurdistan
    Democratic Party of Iran underwent a split in February 1988, and in March
    of 1988, the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran Revolutionary Leadership
    was formed. After the split, Mr. Kermanj joined this new Party as a
    4thrank cadre (Boroumand Center Interview, October 26, 2021). He was
    working at the secretariat of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran -
    Revolutionary Leadership from 1989 up until a few months before he was
    killed. He served at the secretariat, he worked in public relations, and
    he was responsible for communications between the different parties in
    Iranian Kurdistan (Boroumand Center Interview, June 25, 2022; Shahid
    Website, no date). Mr. Kermanj and his family were constantly receiving
    death threats. Therefore, after consultation with the leadership of the
    Kurdistan Democratic Party Revolutionary Leadership and with their
    approval, Mr. Kermanj and his family sought asylum in Turkiye in the fall
    of 1994, and they settled in the town of Corum. According to one of his
    acquaintances, before he emigrated to Turkiye, Mr. Kermanj had been
    responsible for communication between different parties in Kurdistan, and
    the Islamic Republic regularly sent threatening messages to him through
    acquaintances who visited him from Iranian Kurdistan. They threatened to
    kill him if he did not cease his activities (Boroumand Center Interview,
    June 22, 2022). During this time, Mr. Kermanj and his family lived on a
    limited financial allowance from the United Nations and they also received
    money from family and friends. In Turkiye, he secretly carried out
    political activities. Since Kurdish Parties were harassed by the Turkish
    government, Mr. Kermanj had said he was a supporter of the Imperial
    Government of Iran (Boroumand Center Interview, October 26, 2021).
    According to one of his relatives, he was orderly, democratic, liberal,
    forgiving, tireless, and positive. He was a good manager and loved to read
    and to learn. He was very interested in writing plays, in the theater, and
    in acting. He had written several plays about the social and political
    pain and suffering of the people, which he would put on for the members of
    the party during special occasions. He was usually the director, and
    sometimes he would also act (Boroumand Center Interview, October 26 and
    December 12, 2021). Three of Mr. Kermanj s brothers, who were also members
    of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran, were also killed during the
    struggles of this party (Boroumand Center Interview, October 26, 2021,
    Shahid Website, no date). Background on the Formation of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party Following internal conflicts within the Democratic Party
    of Iranian Kurdistan established in 1945 with the aim of autonomy for
    Kurdistan in northwestern Iran the Party went through a shakeup in 2006
    and was split into two separate organizations, the Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (PDK). The PDK seeks
    the establishment of a Kurdistan Republic within the framework of a
    federal Iran . (Charter of the PDK, passed in its 16thCongress in February
    2016). This party has not ruled out armed struggle; it has, however,
    prioritized political struggle and the expression of the pe
