    I am a human being, [freedom-loving, liberal, and broadminded], as
    attested to by this letter, which [in itself] constitutes the order to
    fire and the drinking from the cup of hemlock (reference to the death of
    Socrates). Let future generations know that in the calamitous land that is
    Iran, there did exist those who courageously gave up their lives and faced
    death like men." Mr. Ali Akbar Sa idi Sirjani, a famous poet, literary
    figure, author, and researcher, was one of the victims of a series of
    political murders that have come to be known as Chain Murders. Information
    regarding his life, activities, and the manner in which he was killed, was
    obtained from numerous sources including a website dedicated to him, in
    which are posted letters from Mr. Sa idi Sirjani to the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, Aytallah Khamenei (not dated), the then President
    Hashemi Rafsanjani (19 October 1992), and to the judiciary (24 February
    1994); his daughter, Sayeh Sa idi Sirjani s interview with Voice of
    America. Other sources include: The Tragedy of Democracy in Iran , From
    Sheik of San an to Death in Prison , and Yas-o-Das ( Jasmine and Sickle );
    Jomhuri Eslami , Kayhan , and Ettela at newspapers. For detailed
    bibliography see footnotes*. Mr. Sa idi was married in 1960-61 and had
    three daughters. According to one of his friends, he was a freedom-loving
    and broad-minded who was free from ideological attachments and at the
    service of the Iranian culture. His extensive and profound knowledge of
    Persian literature and Iranian history, his insight and wit, his simple
    writing style accompanied by humor and amphibology, his warm and friendly
    speaking manner and his innate talent in story-telling, made Mr. Sa idi
    Sirjani a unique writer with his own style. [1] His choice of the use of
    metaphors and allegories in critiquing authoritarian relations, in
    addition to his character traits such as frankness, courage,
    broad-mindedness, and independent thinking and doing, led to a great many
    professional and social deprivations. Professional Life Mr. Sa idi Sirjani
    completed his elementary school studies in [the town of] Sirjan (Kerman)
    and then entered Daneshsaraye Moqadamatie Kerman ( Kerman Preparatory
    School ). He then studied philosophy at Tehran University and, upon
    obtaining his Bachelor s Degree, returned to Kerman to become a teacher in
    Sirjan and [the city of] Bam. Five years later, he returned to Tehran and
    began working at Iran Cultural Foundation, founded By Dr. Parviz Khanlari,
    first as the person in charge of book publishing, then as Scientific and
    Technical Deputy. He asked to be retired from Iran Cultural Foundation in
    1978, prior to the Revolution. In addition to working at the Iran Cultural
    Foundation, he taught at [Tehran University] Faculty of Literature and at
    the Foundation s Research Department, while publishing his own works.
    After the Revolution, he continued to write, conduct research, and work
    with a number of literary publications. In 1988, he went to the United
    States at the invitation of Columbia University where he taught Persian
    Language and Literature for a year. In subsequent years, he worked with
    Encyclopedia Iranica [2] . Published and Unpublished Work Mr. Sa idi
    Sirjani published his first works entitled Majmu eh Shirin Sokhanane
    Gomnam and Suz-o-Saz , a book of poetry, while he was still a student at
    Tehran University. He gradually became one of the most famous figures in
    Iranian literature with his own unique writing style. In 1961, he began
    his collaboration with Dehkhoda Dictionary at the invitation of Dr. Mo in.
    With the establishment of the Iran Cultural Foundation, he concentrated
    his research work there. Mr. Sa idi Sirjani authored seventeen books,
    collected and made corrections to at least six well-known Persian literary
    works, and worked with literary publications and magazines. Among his most
    important books are Afsaneh ha (Tales), Simaye Do Zan (Faces of Two
    Women), Zahhake Mardush , Bichareh Esfandiar (Poor Esfandiar). His most
    important research work is Tarikhe Bidarie Iranian (History of Iranian
    Awakening). He also made valuable contribution to research with the
    correction and editing of Zakhireh Kharazmshahi , Vaqaye Ettefaqieh ,
    Surabadi Interpretation (a six volume interpretation of a Koran from the
    5th Century A.H.). In the late 1980 s, he also published a number of
    articles in Ettela at newspaper. Before and after the 1979 Revolution, Mr.
    Sa idiSa idi Sirjani s books and articles were subjected to governmental
    censorship. Tales was banned before the Revolution. After the Revolution,
    the publication of the story of Sheik of San an in Negin Magazine , in
    1979, led to the latter s closure. In subsequent years, most of his books
    were banned. Starting in 1988, even his already published works were not
    permitted distribution. Sa idi Sijani Protests Publication Ban Following
    the ban, Mr. Sa idi Sirjani wrote a series of open letters to the
    authorities including the Minister of Culture and
