    News of the execution of a woman without mentioning her name was published
    on Los Angeles Times on March 4, 1994. She was also in the report on the
    situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran prepared by the
    Special Representative of the Commission, Mr. Reynaldo Galindo Pohl,
    published on January 16, 1995. According to the news, this woman was
    married and had children. Arrest and detention The circumstances of the
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charge brought against the
    defendant was adultery . She was accused of having illegitimate relations
    with others and having worked with a corruption gang . The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant s defense. Judgment This defendant was
    sentenced to death and was stoned to death in Qom in March 1994.
