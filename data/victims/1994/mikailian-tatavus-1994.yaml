    Reverend Tatavus Mika'ilian chaired the Council of Protestant Ministers in
    1994. It was a time of extraordinary pressure on Christian clergy.
    Information regarding the life and extrajudicial execution of Tatavus
    Mika'ilian (also spelled "Tateos Michaeilian"), the son of Arshaluis and
    Galust, was gathered from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center with one of his close relatives (February 22, 2023),
    Kayhan newspaper (October 4, 1995), Jomhuri Eslami newspaper (July 6-20,
    1994; June 12 and 19, 1995; October 4, 1995), Hamshahri Newspaper (October
    4, 1995), Pejvak website (August 19, 2015), Human Rights Watch's 1997
    report on religious minorities, Radio Zamaneh (January 17, 2021), and the
    English language website Article 18 (June 28, 2019). The additional
    information was gathered from Iraj Mesdaghi's YouTube and book, including
    interviews and reports on Christian leaders and the murders of pastors,
    Solving the Mystery of the Murder of Christian Pastors, co-authored with
    Farahnaz Anami (2023). His daughter, Mariet Mika'ilian, also spoke about
    her father and his extrajudicial execution in an interview with an
    administrator of the Facebook page "God's Grace in Pain" (February 27,
    2021). Amnesty International also reported on Mr. Mika'ilian's murder in
    its 1994 report. According to available information, Mr. Tatavus
    Mika'ilian was born in 1932 to an Armenian Orthodox family in Tehran. He
    was married with two daughters and a son. He received a bachelor's degree
    in law from the University of Tehran and later completed his studies in
    theology at a university in Beirut. "Instead of pursuing a career as a
    lawyer for wealth, fame, and status, he chose to use his knowledge to
    serve God. He had a good position as a translator with an oil company,
    where he was highly respected. However, he decided to leave that job to
    serve as the Executive Secretary of the Bible Society." Mr. Mika'ilian was
    also one of the founders of the Jama'at-e Rabbani Church* and worked at
    the Gohar School affiliated with the Armenian Evangelical Church, where he
    served as a teacher, assistant director, and director. In 1970, he took
    over the leadership of the Iranian Bible Society. In 1990, he became the
    leader of the Armenian Evangelical Church (John) and assumed pastoral
    responsibilities. During his time in this position, he translated around
    60 religious and moral books, including The Secret of Joy, The Way of the
    Cross, You Will Be My Witnesses, and The Nature and Mission of the Church
    (The interview with Mariet Mika'ilian). Following the extrajudicial
    execution of Haik Hovsepian Mehr, Bishop of the Jama'at-e Rabbani Church,
    Mr. Mika'ilian became head of the Evangelical Pastors' Council. He also
    served as executive secretary of the Evangelical Church Council. His
    daughter noted, "Although he was an Armenian pastor, he held the position
    of executive secretary of the Church Council of Iran. He had a deep love
    for Iran and its people. He often said that God has called many people in
    Iran and we should strive to share the message of salvation with all of
    them. He didn't serve only the Armenians" (Interview with Mariet
    Mika'ilian). After the revolution, Mr. Mika'ilian gave an interview to the
    French newspaper "Le Monde" in which he discussed the harsh conditions
    Christians face in Iran. In response, the Ministry of Culture summoned him
    several times and pressured him to take back his statements. However, he
    strongly resisted this pressure and did not deny what he had said. His
    daughter noted that he "always made the necessary objections and was never
    afraid. Whenever Christians were mistreated, he would go out and protest.
    He always spoke the truth with courage. This attitude angered the Ministry
    of Culture and led to their increasing enmity towards him (interview with
    Mariet Mika'ilian). One of Mr. Mika'ilian's close associates told the
    Boroumand Foundation, "He was often summoned to the Ministry of Culture.
    Once, a cleric said on television that people should avoid dogs, pigs and
    non-Muslims during the month of Muharram. Mr. Mika'ilian went to the
    ministry and "loudly protested" this statement. He often criticized
    Islamic texts and views, pointing out passages that were in direct
    opposition to Christianity. The associate recounted another incident in
    which the school principal told students that instead of saying the Lord's
    Prayer in the morning, they should say "Allahu Akbar" and "Death to
    America. In response, Mr. Mika'ilian instructed students not to say these
    words and said that they would start their day with their own prayer. The
    principal then angrily accused them of insulting the regime and
    disrespecting Khomeini. Mr. Mika'ilian faced many such challenges, but
    always stood up courageously to defend the rights of Christians (Interview
    with the Boroumand Center, February 22, 2023). He also traveled to The
    Hague to protest the situation of Christians in Iran. He said they lacked
    freedom: "He said that the response he receiv
