circumstances: >
    The information about the extrajudicial killing of Haji Mohammad Zia'i is
    drawn from reports by Amnesty International published in 1995 and 1996. A
    Sunni Muslim leader from Bandar-Abbas, Mr. Zia'i was known to be critical
    of government policies. "Amnesty International includes in its definition
    of extrajudicial executions the killing of specific individuals which can
    reasonably be assumed to be the result of government policy at any level."
    Arrest and detention According to Amnesty International, Mr. Haji Mohammad
    Zia'i was arrested in 1981. During the period of his detention in 1981, he
    was reportedly tortured for several weeks. Although he was released later,
    he continued to be harassed. This harassment reportedly increased after
    the execution of Dr Ali Mozaffarian (another Sunni Leader) in 1992. Haji
    Mohammad Zia'i had to travel to Tehran once a month for interrogation. He
    was reportedly summoned for interrogation at the Security Headquarters in
    Laar, in Fars province, on July 15, 1994. During his last interrogation he
    was reportedly promised that he could open the Sunni Mosque in Shiraz,
    which had been closed for some time, and that there would be no need for
    further interrogations. Trial No information is available on the defendant
    s trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Zia'i are not known.
    Evidence of guilt Amnesty International reports that in 1981, Mr. Zia'i
    had been arrested allegedly for giving an interview to a Kuwaiti magazine
    in which he highlighted the plight of Sunni Muslims in Iran and condemned
    the execution of Iranian opposition activists. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Zia'i's defense. Judgment Mr. Zia'i was sentenced to
    death in 1981 and later released. On July 20, 1994, five days after he had
    been summoned for interrogation in Lar, his mutilated body was found in a
    valley around the Shah-Mossallam area, some 200 kilometers from Laar. His
    body was reportedly beheaded, and one arm and one leg had been amputated.
    Security officials in Laar reportedly attributed his death to a car
    accident. "However, this account differs from eye-witness reports
    [received by Amnesty International] which suggest that his mutilated body
    was found separately from the car, which did not bear signs consistent
    with the alleged accident."
