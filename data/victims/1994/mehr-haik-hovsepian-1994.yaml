    He confronted the Islamic Republic single-handedly, compelling them to
    release Pastor Dibaj. Information regarding the life and extrajudicial
    execution of Mr. Haik Hovsepian Mehr was taken from an electronic form
    sent by one of his relatives to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC) on June
    25, 2012, and a documentary titled A Cry from Iran , which was sent to ABC
    by his son (22 November 2013). The additional documents were collected
    from United Nations reports concerning the human rights situation in Iran
    in 1994 and 1995, Amnesty International's report addressing the Iranian
    government's covert suppression and repression, spanning from mid-1993 to
    1995, Kayhan Newspaper (4 October 1995), Jomhouri-e Eslami Newspaper (3
    and 17 February 1994, 16 and 19 July 1994), Truett Journal of Church and
    Mission websites (26 December 2004), Iran for Christ ministries
    organization (Ikelisa) (22 February 2019), Kalameh Website (27 July 2020),
    Joseph Hovsepian's interview Daily news (17 February 2021) and Iran Human
    Rights Documentation Center (12 August 2021). Mr. Hovsepian Mehr was born
    into an Armenian family in Tehran. At the age of 9, due to his parents'
    separation and the resulting financial and social pressures on his mother,
    he apprenticed as a shoemaker for a period. From the age of 13, he began
    attending home prayer meetings, invited by a neighbor, marking the
    beginning of his devotion to Christ. In 1966, he married Takush
    Ginagosian. Shortly after, church leaders requested him to establish a
    church in Gorgan, a city that lacked one. During the Shah's era, he and
    his wife encountered opposition from the people of Gorgan. His brother
    recounted, "We witnessed numerous occasions where he faced problems caused
    by religious fanatics and extremists. He received threatening letters."
    Their church and gatherings were subjected to multiple attacks, and there
    was also an attempted arson on their church. In 1969, they tragically lost
    their son in a truck accident. A colleague from America, who was traveling
    with them, recounts: "My wife, our three children, and we were traveling
    back to Gorgan with Haik, Takush, and their six-month-old son. Around 45
    minutes away from our destination, a bright light from an oncoming car in
    the dark blinded us, leading to a collision with a truck. The impact was
    severe, causing our vehicle's destruction, and rendering us all
    unconscious. I'm uncertain for how long; all I recall is our loss of
    consciousness." Although both parents survived, their four children
    perished in the accident. Mr. Hovsepian Mehr had four more children after
    this heartbreaking incident. After the complete establishment of the
    Islamic Republic in 1981, Mr. Hovsepian Mehr was elected as "the principal
    overseer of Gorgan, serving as the supervisor and bishop of the Rabbani
    congregation's churches." That same year, he relocated to Tehran with his
    family, assuming responsibility for seven churches, comprising two
    Armenian churches, four Rabbani churches, and one Assyrian Pentecostal*
    church. Mr. Hovsepian Mehr held leadership in the Protestant churches in
    Iran and represented the congregational churches across the Middle East.
    He composed and recorded over 60 Christian hymns in Persian. Additionally,
    he was a professional guitar, dulcimer, and piano player. Mr. Hovsepian
    Mehr embarked on a campaign to aid Reverend Mahdi Dibaj , who had
    converted to Christianity at 14 and was arrested and imprisoned by the
    regime's agents in 1984, following the issuance of a death sentence by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Sari. Mr. Dibaj managed to pass his death
    sentence to Mr. Hovsepian Mehr through a prison guard. In response, Mr.
    Hovsepian Mehr penned a letter to the council of the Rabbani Assemblies,
    urging an international appeal. He disseminated this news worldwide,
    ceaselessly advocating for Dibaj's release. These dedicated efforts bore
    fruit when government authorities released Pastor Dibaj on January 16,
    1994, after a nine-year incarceration. According to his friend, "Brother
    Haik single-handedly confronted the Islamic Republic, compelling them to
    release Brother Dibaj," (documentary A Cry from Iran) Relatives of Mr.
    Hovsepian Mehr remember him fondly in kindness. His brother, George
    Hovsepian, reflects on him: "No words can fully capture his character.
    Personally, both his spiritual and social sides intrigued me. He was
    remarkably simple, honest, friendly, and had a delightful sense of humor,
    making him approachable to anyone. Despite Haik's unassuming nature, he
    held a quiet strength. He was dependable, discreet, and notably patient.
    It was fascinating; in chaotic moments, he'd calmly resolve issues with a
    smile and unhurried pace." (Kalameh Website) "Despite his meekness, his
    voice advocating for the persecuted was resoundingly powerful."
    (documentary A Cry from Iran) Mr. Hovsepian Mehr was among the prominent
    and well-known figures in Iran's Armenian community. Following the
