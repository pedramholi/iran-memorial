    Pastor Dibaj, who spent many years in prison and was sentenced to death on
    charge of apostasy for having converted to Christianity, was acquitted and
    released from prison after intense national and international advocacy on
    his behalf. But freedom did not mean security. Information about the
    extrajudicial execution of Mr. Mehdi Dibaj, son of Hassan, was compiled
    from Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC) interview with Mr. Issa Dibaj, his
    son (January 27, 2024) and also from the Jomhuri Eslami newspapers
    (January 17, and February 17, 1994 and February 26 and July 7, 11 and 22
    1994), Kayhan (January 18, 1994), IRNA the Islamic Republic News Agency
    websites (July 17, 1993, July 2, 1994), Article 18 (June 24, 2015), Crisis
    Magazine (January 1, 2007), Iran Human Rights Documentation Center (August
    12, 2021), and Kalameh website (January 9, 2024). Additional information
    on this case was obtained from the book Razha-ye Malakut (The Secrets of
    Heaven) written by Ms. Fereshte Dibaj (2007/2008), Mr. Issa Dibaj s
    interview with SAT7-PARS on YouTube (June 21, 2021), 1995 Report of
    Amnesty International, and Mr. Dibaj's defense report in the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Sari published on the Farsinet website. According
    to the available information, Mr. Dibaj was born in Esfahan and lived in
    Babol. He was born into a Muslim family, but at the age of 14, while
    visiting a relative who was being treated at the Esfahan Christian
    Hospital, he obtained a Bible booklet from a member of the hospital staff.
    He was introduced to Christianity and officially converted in the Loqa
    (Luke) Episcopal Church of Esfahan. "When the seriousness of his faith
    became clear to his family, they kicked him out of the house. So, my
    father went to Tehran and took refuge in the house of a Christian there."
    (Kalameh website) Mr. Dibaj worked in a Christian bookstore in Tehran.
    After some time, he went to Beirut to study Christian theology at the
    suggestion of the then-leaders of the Evangelical Church. He then traveled
    to India and Switzerland to complete additional courses. He was also in
    Afghanistan for two years. There, he translated Christian books and
    broadcasted a Christian radio program called "Radio Neda-ye Massih"
    (Revelation of Christ Radio). He was the pastor of the Congregational
    Church. Mr. Dibaj got married at 37 and had four children. He was fluent
    in English and taught for some time as an English teacher at Babol
    University of Technology in Mazandaran province. But after a while, he
    resigned from the position and spent all his time translating Christian
    materials. "He lived in utmost simplicity and contentment." (Razha ye
    Malakut). "He was a good father. He was a real believer. His faith was
    essential to him. [Before the arrest] we had a normal life. But he
    maintained his belief and insisted that we grow up in the Christian
    faith," said his son (ABC interview with Mr. Issa Dibaj) According to
    available information, Mr. Dibaj was arrested for the first time on
    January 28, 1984, for insulting Ayatollah Khomeini in an unsigned letter.
    He was released on bail after 68 days of imprisonment. As a result of him
    upholding his Christian faith and refusing to deny Christ, the General
    Court of Babol accused him of apostasy. He was re-arrested a year later,
    when he, accompanied by one of his friends, returned to the relevant
    authority to withdraw the bond document. In 1987, The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Sary convicted him of apostasy and sentenced him to
    death. Mr. Dibaj did not accept a public defender and defended himself in
    court. Mr. Dibaj's response to the charge of apostasy in the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Sari was as follows: "I have been accused of
    apostasy!" They say, You were a Muslim, and you became a Christian. No, I
    was a non-believer for many years. I obeyed God's call by studying and
    researching. I believed in Jesus Christ, Lord, so that I may have eternal
    life (John: 6:47). Regarding prison and his father s adherence to the
    Christian faith, Mr. Dibaj s son says: "Apparently, in prison, they would
    tell him that he only needed to pretend and say that he had become Muslim
    and have returned to the faith so that they could rectify the [judgment]
    for apostasy. Then, you can go abroad and become a priest. We will have
    nothing to do with you. But he continued what he knew to be correct. He
    insisted, and this is an important point; not everyone does this.
    According to Mr. Dibaj s son, his father was in Evin prison for several
    years but, on some occasions, they had no idea where Mr. Dibaj was. They
    did not hear from him because he was prohibited from receiving visitors.
    (Issa Dibaj's interview with SAT7-PARS). However, according to Mr. Dibaj s
    son, a conscript in the Sari penitentiary gave a copy of his father's
    sentence to Bishop Haik Hovsepian Mehr, which resulted in the
    intensification of international pressure on Iran for the release of Mr.
    Dibaj: "In response to this death sentence, Bishop Haik Hovsepian, who at
    that time was
