    Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Mohammad Ali Asadi
    was published in the Assoo (February 1, 2020) and Iran Wire (June 23,
    2020) websites. According to available information, Mr. Asadi was a
    Royalist and opposed the Islamic Republic. In a report published after his
    death, the Romanian language newspaper Evenimentul Zilei wrote: Mr. Asadi
    had accompanied the former Shah s nephew when he had come to Romania for a
    visit. Mr. Asadi had applied for asylum in the United States during his
    stay in Romania. He was married. Background of Extrajudicial Killings by
    the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long
    history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world.
    Ever since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and
    outside the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing
    a large number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable.
    The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is
    not clear; however, these murders began in February 1979, and have
    continued during the existence of the Islamic Republic both inside and
    outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has identified over 540
    murders outside Iran attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. (3)
    Opponents of the Islamic Republic have been assassinated by the agents of
    the Islamic Republic in various ways outside Iran, in countries such as
    the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai,
    Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria,
    Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the
    United States across the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases, not much
    information has been published about these murders and local officials
    have not issued any arrest warrants. Documentation, evidence, and traces
    obtained through investigations conducted by local police and judicial
    authorities confirm, however, the theory of state committed crimes. In
    certain cases, these investigations have resulted in the expulsion (The
    Netherlands, 2018) or arrest (Brussels, 2020; Turkey, 2021) of Iranian
    diplomats. In limited cases outside Iran, the perpetrators of these
    murders have been arrested and put on trial (Paris 1980 and 1991) and the
    evidence presented, revealed the defendants connection to Iran s
    government institutions, and an arrest warrant (the Mikonos Trial in
    Germany) has been issued for Iran s then-Minister of Information. The
    manner in which these killings were organized and implemented in Iran and
    abroad, is indicative of a single pattern which, according to Roland
    Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor, contains common parameters and detailed
    planning. It can be ascertained from the similarities between these
    murders in different countries that the Iranian government is the
    principal entity who ordered the implementation of these crimes. (4).
    Iranian authorities have not officially accepted responsibility for these
    murders and have even attributed their commission to their opposition.
    Nevertheless, since the very inception of the Islamic Republic regime, the
    Islamic Republic officials have justified these crimes from an ideological
    and legal standpoint. In the spring of 1979, Sadeq Khalkhali, the first
    Chief Shari a Judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts, officially
    announced the regime s decision to implement extrajudicial executions, and
    justified the decision: These people have been sentenced to death; from
    the Iranian people s perspective, if someone wants to assassinate these
    individuals abroad, in any country, no government has any right to bring
    the perpetrator to trial as a terrorist, because such a person is the
    implementing agent of the sentence issued by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court. Therefore, they are Mahduroddam ( one whose blood may be spilled,
    whose life can be taken, without the perpetrator incurring any punishment
    ) and their sentence is death regardless of where they are [and where you
    find them]. More than 10 years after these proclamations, in a speech
    talking about the security forces success, Ali Fallahian, the regime s
    Minister of Information stated the following regarding the elimination of
    members of the opposition: We have had success in inflicting damage to
    many of these little groups outside the country and on our borders.
    (Speech broadcast on the state-run Iranian Radio and Television on August
    31, 1992, quoted from Asr Iran, August 17, 2006; and Ali Arabshahi
    Facebook Page, June 17, 2013). At different times and on various
    occasions, the Islamic Republic of Iran s political, judicial, and
    security officials have confirmed the existence of long-term policies,
    planning, and budgets for the implementation of these killings, and have
    also confirmed their successful implementation in certain instances.*
