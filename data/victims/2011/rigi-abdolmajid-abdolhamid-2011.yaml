    News of Mr. Abdolmajid (Abdolhamid) Rigi s execution was published in Iran
    newspaper (June 2, 2011) and in the Human Rights and Democracy Activists
    in Iran website (June 1, 2011). Additional information about this case was
    obtained from Javan newspaper (April 17, 2006, and June 14, 2006), ISNA
    news agency (September 12, 2009), and from other sources. Mr. Abdolmajid
    Rigi was 36 years old, from the city of Zabol, and residing in the city of
    Zahedan in Sistan and Baluchestan Province. This case is related to the
    killing of a police officer and a civilian in the course of a police chase
    of two suspects. On the afternoon of April 15, 2006, police officers
    became suspicious of two passengers in a black Xantia automobile with dark
    windows on Khalij Fars Street off of Tehran s Azadegan Highway. Based on
    available information, the suspects disobeyed the police order to stop and
    sped away. The police gave chase, which ultimately led to a shootout
    between the police and the suspects around the Nematabad neighborhood in
    the south of Tehran in which a police officer, several civilians, and both
    suspects were injured. The police officer and one of the civilians died of
    their injuries before arriving at the hospital. Arrest and detention On
    the afternoon of Saturday, April 15, 2006, in the course of a shootout
    with the police in which he was shot in the leg, Mr. Mr. Abdolmajid Rigi
    was arrested and taken to the Shapur Street Criminal Investigations
    Office. He spent five months in detention there. Thereafter, two separate
    cases were opened against Mr. Rigi and he was then transferred to the city
    of Karaj s Rajaishahr Prison. He spent five years at the prison s Ward One
    until May-June 2011. Mr. Rigi was deprived of visitations with his family
    for the last eight months of his incarceration. Trial Tehran Revolutionary
    Court Branch 15 tried Mr. Abdolmajid Rigi s first case toward the middle
    of February, 2008, with his attorney in attendance. Mr. Rigi s other case
    was tried in Tehran Province Criminal Court Branch 71 on April 18, 2009.
    Charges Mr. Abdolmajid Rigi was charged with transporting and trafficking
    380 kilograms of opium, Efsad fel-Arz ( spreading corruption on Earth ),
    Moharebeh ( waging war against God ), intentional murder, combating the
    police, and creating insecurity in society . Evidence of guilt Based on
    available information, Mr. Rigi s confession during the interrogation
    phase and the confession of the other defendant in the case, and the
    recovery of two Kalashnikov weapons from the defendant s car along with 17
    cartridges and 537 bullets, were used as evidence against Mr. Rigi. The
    testimony of eyewitnesses regarding the killing of a police officer and a
    passer-by was also presented as evidence in this case. Defense Mr.
    Abdolmajid Rigi spent five months at the Shapur Street Criminal
    Investigations Office being interrogated and tortured, while still
    suffering from a gunshot wound. Based on available information, the
    interrogators would plunge a wooden stick in his wound in order to extract
    a confession from him (Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran
    website, May 31, 2011). Mr. Rigi and the other defendant in the case were
    not carrying any drugs at the time of their arrest. There is a discrepancy
    regarding the amount of drugs Mr. Rigi and Defendant Number 2 of the case
    were accused of trafficking: some reports stated the amount as 280
    kilograms, others as 400 kilograms (Javan newspaper, September 26, 2012,
    September 11, 2009). Additionally, although Mr. Rigi and the other
    defendant in the case had been forced to confess in the interrogations
    that they had come to Tehran for a drug deal, the judicial investigations
    did not produce any drugs, despite the fact that a seat from the car was
    discovered in the home of one of the defendant s acquaintances (Hamshahri
    newspaper, July 12, 2006). The murder of a civilian attributed to Mr. Rigi
    was not proven in the course of judicial investigations, and it became
    clear that the passer-by who was killed and the other people who were
    injured had been shot by the police (Human Rights and Democracy Activists
    in Iran website, May 31, 2011). Judgment Tehran Revolutionary Court Branch
    15 sentenced Mr. Mohammad Reza Rigi to two instances of capital
    punishment: the first for transporting and trafficking drugs, the second
    for Moharebeh and Efsad fel-Arz. The Supreme Court upheld the decision.
    Furthermore, at the request of the police officer s next of kin, Tehran
    Province Criminal Court Branch 71 sentenced Mr. Rigi to death (Qesas of
    life). This decision was also upheld by the Supreme Court Branch 16. On
    the day prior to his execution, officials transferred Mr. Rigi and the
    other defendant in the case, who was his nephew, from Rajaishahr Prison s
    Ward One, Hall One, Cell 24, to solitary confinement cells. The
    implementation of Defendant Number 2 s sentence was, however, delayed. Mr.
    Abdolmajid Rigi was hanged in the Evin Prison yard at dawn on June 1,
    2011. His family and hi
