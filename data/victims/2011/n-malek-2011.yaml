    News of the execution of Mr. Malek N. along with six others, was published
    on the website of the Kerman Provincial Courthouse on March 1, 2011.
    Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s
    arrest and detention. Trial This trial took place in the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Bam. No further information is available about the
    defendant s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Malek N. was announced
    as "possession of 900 grams of crack." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on the defendant's defense. Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Malek N. to death and the ruling was confirmed by
    the General Public Prosecutor s Office. The defendant s pardon and
    sentence reduction request was denied by the Pardon Commission of
    Provincial Courthouse and he was hanged in Bam prison in 2011. The exact
    date of this execution is unknown.
