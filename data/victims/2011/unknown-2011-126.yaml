circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown person, along with two others, was
    published on the websites of the Mukrian news agency on May 11, and
    (without mentioning his name) IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on May
    10, 2011. According to the Head of Miandoab Courthouse, one of the three
    was a resident of Miandoab and the other two were residents of Orumieh.
    Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s
    arrest and detention. According to IRNA, he was arrested in Minadoab.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    charge against this defendant was announced as "drug trafficking." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on the defendant's defense.
    Judgment The court condemned this defendant to death and the ruling was
    confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was hanged in the Miandoab Prison yard
    on May 10, 2011.
