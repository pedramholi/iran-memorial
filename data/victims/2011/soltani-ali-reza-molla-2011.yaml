    Does the fame of a murdered athlete justify a death sentence for a
    17-year-old boy? News of Mr. Ali Reza Mollasoltani s execution was
    published on Alborz Province Judiciary s website, ISNA, and Fars News
    Agency (September 20, 2011), Mehr News Agency (September 21, 2011), and on
    Mohammad Mostafa ee s weblog Modafe . Additional information was obtained
    from various sources, including Alborz Province Judiciary s website
    (August 6, August 28, and September 19, 2011), Fars News Agency (September
    5, 2011), Karaj General and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office s website
    (August 18, 2011), Mellat Online (August 8, 2011), Tabnak (12 July 2018)
    and other sources.* Human rights organizations, including the Office of
    the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (September 22, 2011)
    and Amnesty International (September 20 and 21, 2011) condemned this
    execution. Some information has also been obtained from Mr. Mollasoltani s
    family s interview with Asseman weekly, cited on the Vista website. Mr.
    Mollasoltani, son of Abolqassem, was born on December 25, 1993. He was his
    family s youngest child and continued his studies until eighth grade. He
    then started to do manual labor in various cities along with his older
    brother. According to his brother, he was a hard-working person without
    any history of violence (Mehrdad Mollasoltani s interview with Asseman
    Weekly). His case, along with that of two other defendants, is related to
    the murder of an athlete known as Iran s strongest man which occurred at
    midnight on July 16, 2011, in the city of Karaj s Golshahr neighborhood,
    on Puneh Street. Mr. Mollasoltani, who had not yet reached the age of
    eighteen, and two of his friends were engaged in a verbal argument with
    the passengers of another car while driving. The argument turned into a
    physical altercation. The person gravely injured in the scuffle was
    Ruhollah Dadashi, Iran s strongest man, who died on the way to the
    hospital. Owing to Mr. Dadashi s fame and popularity, the media and the
    authorities paid unusual and one-sided attention to this case and worked
    to provoke public opinion against Mr. Mollasoltani. Following an official
    announcement, thousands of people showed up for a teenage boy s execution
    The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and
    Amnesty International both condemned this execution and considered it
    contrary to human rights standards and a violation of the Convention on
    the Rights of the Child. Prior to the implementation of the sentence,
    Amnesty International had issued a declaration asking Iran s judicial
    authorities to stop the execution. International law strictly prohibits
    the death penalty for individuals who have not yet reached the age of 18
    at the time of the commission of the crime. As a signatory to the
    International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on
    the Rights of the Child, Iran is obligated not to execute individuals who
    have committed a crime when they were children. Arrest and Detention
    According to the Karaj Police Chief, Mr. Mollasoltani was arrested on July
    19, 2011, through the efforts of Tehran and Alborz Provinces specialized,
    security, information, and criminal investigations agents. His two
    companions were arrested on July 17, 2011 (IRNA, July 20, 2011). There is
    conflicting information regarding the way Mr. Mollasoltani was arrested.
    In explaining the indictment, the Karaj Prosecutor s representative stated
    that Mr. Mollasoltani was arrested on July 19, 2011, when he intended to
    leave town. However, according to Mr. Mollasoltani s testimony in court,
    he surrendered himself to the Criminal Investigations Bureau in Karaj; he
    said that the police s claim of arresting him was a lie. His attorney also
    stated in court that Mr. Mollasoltani had surrendered himself (Mellat
    Online, August 8, 2011). Mollasoltani s brother also stated in an
    interview that he was with him and had coordinated with the Criminal
    Investigations Bureau to deliver his brother to them (Mehrdad Mollasoltani
    interview with Asseman Weekly). Mr. Mollasoltani s case was reviewed in a
    meeting in Karaj on Wednesday, July 20, with the country s Prosecutor
    General, the Karaj Prosecutor, the Prosecutor s Office s homicide
    investigation judge, and Alborz Province and the head of the City of Karaj
    s Criminal Investigations Bureau s Homicide Division in attendance. The
    case even reached the Islamic Consultative Assembly s (Majless ) Councils
    and Internal Affairs Commission s Security Committee, and the athlete s
    murder was reviewed in the presence of judicial, security, and Alborz
    Province s police officials (Karaj General and Revolutionary Prosecutor
    Office July 20, 2011). Mr. Mollasoltani s case was taken up exclusively by
    Karaj General and Revolutionary Prosecutor Office Branch 21, and an
    indictment was issued against him (Karaj General and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor Office August 18, 2011). He was in detention for two months,
    during which his family visited him several times
