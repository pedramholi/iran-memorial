    News of the execution of Mr. H. B. a resident of Bojnord, along with four
    others, was published on the websites of IRNA (Islamic Republic News
    Agency) and Semnan Courthouse on December 26, 2011, quoting the Public
    Relations Office of Semnan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial This
    trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shahrud. No further
    information is available on this trail. Charges The charges against Mr. H.
    B. were announced as "transportation and possession of narcotics." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. H. B. to death
    and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor s Office.
    The defendant s pardon request was denied by the Central Pardon Committee
    and he was hanged in Shahrud prison on December 26, 2011.
