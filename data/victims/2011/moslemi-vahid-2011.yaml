    News of the execution of Mr. Vahid Moslemi, son of Habib, along with 21
    others, was published in the Iran newspaper on September 19, 2011 and on
    the website of Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran on September
    18, 2011. Additional information was taken from the same website on
    September 16 and 17, 2011. This case was related to the transportation and
    possession of narcotics and importing them into the prison. Mr. Moslemi,
    an Afghan citizen, was 17 years old when the crime took place.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention
    on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Moslemi was detained in the Qezelhesar Prison for two years.
    On September 17, 2011, he was transferred to solitary confinement either
    at the Evin Prison or in Gohardasht Prison where he was allowed to visit
    his family. According to Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran,
    seven prisoners could not visit their families in person and had to talk
    to them in booths. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Moslemi (Iran
    newspaper). No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Moslemi. was announced as transporting narcotics into
    the prison. (Iran newspaper) The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Moslemi. was possession of 307
    grams of crack. (Iran newspaper) Defense Mr. Moslemi was under 18 when the
    crime was committed. No information is available on his defense. Judgment
    The Islamic Revolutionary Court condemned Mr. Vahid Moslemi to death and
    the General Public Prosecutor s Office confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged, along with 21 others, either at the Evin Prison yard in Tehran or
    in Gohardasht Prison in Karaj on September 18, 2011. Authorities told the
    families to go to the Kahrizak morgue to receive the bodies on September
    18, 2011.
