    Information about Mr. Abdorrahman Badavi was taken from an announcement of
    Amnesty International (04/19/2011) and the Ahwaz European Human Rights
    Organization. Additional information was collected from several sources
    including: a letter from Ms. Shirin Ebadi to Ms. Navi Pillay, the UN Human
    Rights Commissioner (04/18/2011); an announcement from Human Rights Watch
    (04/29/2011); the Ahwaz Human Rights Organization; Radio Farda
    (04/18/2011); BBC (04/18/2011); Fars News (04/16/2011) and HRANA
    (04/16/2011). Mr. Badavi, father of three, was thirty-years-old, married,
    and from Shush. According to a report from Amnesty International , he was
    killed while going from Ahvaz to Hamidieh on 04/14/2011, during arrests
    before the protests of April 15. Based on the information sent to ABF, Mr.
    Badavi was shot by security and police forces after having passed a
    checkpoint. According to Human Rights Watch - a week before the
    anniversary of the 2005 protests - police and Basij forces had set up a
    lot of checkpoints in different cities of Khuzestan where Arabs live and
    intended to arrest several of the Arab activists. In an announcement
    published couple of days after these incidents, Amnesty International
    mentioned that Mr. Badavi was 37-years-old. The Officials Reaction Iranian
    judicial and state authorities did not provide a clear explanation about
    the number or names of those killed during the protests of April 2011 in
    different areas of the province. Fars news quoted the commander of the
    Shadegan Police station that one person was killed, and the head of the
    police station of the Abudi area of Shadegan was injured during clashes
    with "armed insurgents. In another response, the temporary leader of Ahvaz
    Friday prayers, Ayatollah Al-e Kasiri, said that people in Khuzestan are
    separated from limited anti-revolutionary groups, affiliated with the west
    (Fars News 04/16/2011). According to the information in Ms. Ebadi s letter
    to UN Human Rights Commissioner, security forces used threats to silence
    the families of those killed and arrested several family members who were
    interviewed by Arab media. The Family s Remarks No information regarding
    remarks or reactions by Mr. Badavi s family is available. A Summary of the
    Legal Defects in the Adjudication of Mr. Abdorrahman Badavi s Case
    Pursuant to the Law on the Use of Arms by the Armed Forces in Exigent
    Cases, members of the armed forces may use their weapons only under
    conditions provided for by this Law. The Law states that first, use of a
    weapon must be necessary. Secondly, other means of dispersing the crowd
    must have been utilized, and if the objective has not been reached, a
    weapon can be fired as a last resort. As for firing the weapon, a warning
    must be given prior to firing, then a warning shot must be fired [in the
    air], and only then a shot may be fired aiming below the waist; and
    finally, [if none of the latter steps are successful in reaching the
    objective,] shots can be fired above the waist. Furthermore, the officer
    in question must have physical and mental competence, as well as the
    requisite training and skills [to fire a weapon]. In many of the shootings
    involving protesters, we notice that none of these steps and legal
    requirements are adhered to. The gathering in the course of which
    Abdorrahman Badavi was shot was by no means an armed one. The officers
    could easily have used other means, such as tear gas or pepper spray to
    disperse the protesters, and if that had not brought about the desired
    result, it was very easily possible to stop the targeted person without
    shooting at the sensitive parts of his body such as the head and the
    chest, and shoot him below the waist. Published reports of said
    demonstrations indicate that there was absolutely no need to resort to
    firing directly [at the subject], and that Abdorrahman Badavi s killing
    was, therefore, illegal. The shooters should have been criminally
    prosecuted. A Summary of the Khuzestan Protests Subsequent to the
    publication of a letter dated July 24, 1998, ascribed to then-President
    Khatami s Chief of Staff, Mohammad Ali Abtahi, demonstrations protesting
    the letter broke out on Friday, April 15, 2005, first in [the city of]
    Ahvaz, and then in other cities, such as Mahshahr and Hamidideh, and
    continued for several days. The letter emphasized the modification of
    Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab population through promotion and
    encouragement of the migration of non-native populations to the province,
    thus reducing Khuzestan s Arab population to one third of the total
    population of the province. Although the government s spokesperson
    officially denied the existence of this letter on Saturday, April 16, the
    demonstrations that had been called for by the Coordination Committee for
    Popular Protests in Ahvaz * continued extensively in the coming days. In
    calling for demonstrations, the organizers highlighted various factors,
    including the central government s policies in expropriating Arab farmers
    lands for various pr
