    News of the execution of Mr. Sa doldin Salimi, along with 21 others, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on September 19, 2011, and on the websites
    of Kurdpa, Kurdistan News Agency and Human Rights and Democracy Activists
    in Iran on September 18, 2011. Additional information was taken from the
    Human Rights and Democracy Activists website on September 17, 2011. He was
    married and from the Sorkhtu Village near Sarvabad in Kurdistan. This case
    and the cases of other defendants were related to the transportation and
    possession of narcotics and importing them into the prison. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Salimi was arrested in 2009 (Kurdpa). The circumstances of
    his arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary
    Court tried Mr. Salimi (Iran newspaper). No information is available on
    his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Salimi were announced
    as dealing and possession of narcotics. (Kurdpa and Iran newspaper) The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Salimi was possession of 980 grams of crack, 7.5 grams of
    opium, and 15 grams of burned opium. (Iran newspaper) Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Salimi s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court condemned Mr. Sa doldin Salimi to death and the
    General Public Prosecutor s Office confirmed the ruling. He was hanged,
    along with 21 others, either at the Evin Prison yard in Tehran or in
    Gohardasht Prison in Karaj on September 18, 2011. According to Kurdpa, he
    was executed in Kahrizak Prison. Authorities told the families of 22
    prisoners to go to the Kahrizak morgue to receive the bodies on September
    18, 2011.
