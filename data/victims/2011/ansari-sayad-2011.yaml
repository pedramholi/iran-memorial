    News of the execution of Mr. Sayad Ansari, along with eight others, was
    published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency in
    Iran) on March 1, 2011. According to this report, seven of the nine were
    Kurds and two were Azari including two women. Seven individuals were
    residents of the border town of Sarv in Azarbaijan-e Gharbi province. In a
    different report on March 4, 2011, HRANA confirmed the execution of eleven
    individuals on the same day. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charge against Mr.
    Sayad Ansari was announced as "drug related." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defence No information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment
    No specific information is available about the defendant s execution. Mr.
    Sayad Ansari was executed in Orumieh Central Prison on February 28, 2011.
