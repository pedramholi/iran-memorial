    News of the execution of Mr. Reza Ghorbani, son of Gholamreza, along with
    six others, was published on the websites of the Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran on January 11, and IRNA (Islamic Republic
    News Agency) on January 12, 2011, quoting the Information Base of the
    Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial This
    trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran in 2009. No
    future information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Reza Ghorbani were announced as "selling of 200 grams
    of opium, dealing of 200 grams of heroin in four months, and possession of
    one kilogram and 355 grams of heroin." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defence No information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Reza Ghorbani to death and he was hanged in Tehran
    on January 12, 2011 at dawn.
