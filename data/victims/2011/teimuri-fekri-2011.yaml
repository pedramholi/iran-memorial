    News of the execution of Mr. Fekri Teimuri, along with two others, was

    (without mentioning his name) IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on May
    10, 2011. According to the Head of Miandoab Courthouse, one of the three
    was a resident of Miandoab and the other two were residents of Orumieh.

    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Teimuri. Defense No information is available on Mr. Teimuri 's defense.

    confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was hanged in the Miandoab Prison yard
    on May 10, 2011. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Darvishi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Darvishi 's defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Fathollah Darvishi to death and the
    ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was hanged in the Miandoab
    Prison yard on May 10, 2011.
