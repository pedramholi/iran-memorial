    News of the execution of Mr. Amir Shirmohammadi, along with three others,
    was published on the website of the Human Rights and Democracy Activists
    in Iran on October 19, 2011. He was an Afghan citizen and his case was
    related to narcotics. According to his family, he was 17 years old when
    the crime was committed; but, in his case document, they falsely wrote 33.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention
    on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Shirmohammadi was arrested in 2007. He was first detained at
    the Children s Rehabilitation Center in Esfahan for four years, and then
    at the Youth Section of the Esfahan Central Prison (Dastgerd). However,
    the circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Shirmohammadi s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Shirmohammadi was announced as possession of
    narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Shirmohammadi. Defense Mr.
    Shirmohammadi was under 18 years old when the crime was committed. No
    information is available on his defense. Judgment Mr. Shirmohammadi was
    hanged, along with three others, at the Esfahan Central Prison (Dastgerd)
    on October 16, 2011. His body was given to his family two days later. He
    was buried at Gaz-Barkhar Cemetery near Shahinshahr in Esfahan. According
    to the Head of Sentence Enforcement of the Esfahan Revolutionary Court,
    the reason for the delay in giving the body to his family was the problem
    that the family created for the Islamic Republic regime. Authorities asked
    the family not to take pictures or films of the body. (Human Rights and
