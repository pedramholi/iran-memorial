    Information relating to the execution of Ms. Zahra Bahrami, a UK resident
    with dual Iranian-Dutch citizenship, was drawn from official statements by
    Iranian authorities, published reports by human rights groups, testimonies
    of her family, media reports, and a Boroumand Foundation's interview with
    a former prisoner. The latter was detained in Evin during the detention
    and interrogation of Ms. Bahrami and managed to communicate with her for a
    short time while she was in solitary confinement and also when she was
    brought to the public ward. This person was interviewed outside Iran
    (November 2011 and January, 2012). Also see Amnesty International
    statements (December 2010, 29 January and 16 February 2011), announcement
    by the Public and Revolution Prosecutor's Office (29 January 2011), Radio
    Netherlands Worldwide, (27 and 31 January 2011, and 4 February 2011),
    Reuters (2 February 2011), Wall Street Journal (7 February 2011), BBC (29
    January 2011), Deutsche Welle (29 January 2011), Radio Free Europe (22
    December 2011).* The news of Ms. Bahrami's execution led to tensions
    between Iran and the Netherlands as well as in Iran's relations with the
    European Union. The Dutch media, some political parties, and Iranian
    residents in the Netherlands criticized the Dutch government for its slow
    reaction and its limited efforts in support of Ms. Bahrami (Radio
    Netherlands Worldwide, 31 January 2011). Furthermore, the Dutch Parliament
    summoned the Foreign Minister for explanation (Radio Zamaneh, 31 January
    2011). The Dutch government temporarily suspended all diplomatic contact
    with Iran. Iran responded by accusing the [European] states of meddling in
    its internal affairs (Reuters, 2 February 2011). Ms Bahrami was born in
    Tehran and had a son and two daughters. According to the available
    information, she had experienced many difficulties throughout her life.
    She left Iran with her son in 1991 after her divorce from her first
    husband. She settled in the Netherlands in 1992, where she eked out a
    living through performing professional Indian dancing. She was also a
    student of Indian sitar music at the Rotterdam Conservatory. According to
    Dutch media reports (Radio Netherlands Worldwide, 4 February 2011), Ms.
    Bahrami got involved in drug smuggling in 1999 after she learned that one
    of her daughters was in a poor psychological condition. She needed money
    to pay for her fare to Iran and bring her daughter to the Netherlands. But
    the attempt proved to be ultimately unsuccessful. She was arrested by the
    Dutch authorities in 2003 and handed down a three-year prison sentence.
    Ms. Bahrami left for Britain in 2006 to begin a new life. In 2007 she was
    again arrested in the Netherlands while carrying a forged Austrian
    passport, and sentenced to one year in prison (Radio Netherlands
    Worldwide, (4 February 2011). Her daughter, Ms Banafsheh Nayebpour, said
    in an interview that her mother visited Iran quite often in order to see
    her and the children of her brother, whom she had been helping ever since
    the latter's execution (International Campaign for Human Rights, 26
    January 2011). According to existing information, Ms. Bahrami became
    politically active in support of the opposition after arriving in Britain.
    She was apparently in contact with opposition media under the alias of
    "Kurdieh Banoo", and was providing them with occasional reports on the
    demonstrations inside Iran. In that connection, a recording of her voice
    in conversation with Pars TV is posted on YouTube. During that period, she
    paid several visits to Iran. According to Amnesty International, Ms
    Bahrami had visited Tehran to take care of her daughter who was receiving
    chemotherapy treatment (Amnesty International, 29 January 2011). The
    witness interviewed by ABF remembers Ms. Bahrami as a lively woman who was
    very kind to fellow prisoners and defiant towards the guards. I could hear
    her make prisoners laugh. Sometimes, she even made the guards, laugh. She
    liked music and was often singing her cell (ABF interview, January 20,
    2012). Arrest and Detention Ms. Bahrami was arrested in the winter of 2010
    alongside three other individuals. Non-governmental and human rights
    sources believe that she was arrested during the Ashura protests in
    December 2009 (Amnesty International, 29 January 2011). Ms Bahrami's
    daughter, Ms Nayebpour, also stated in an interview that her mother was
    arrested in a brutal manner while traveling in a car along Tehran's
    Shademan Street two days after Ashura. Quoting her mother, she said that
    Intelligence Ministry agents had arrested her after dragging her out of
    the car by pulling her hair (JARAS, 15 January 2011). According to a
    witness, Ms Bahrami was detained in Ward 209 of Evin Prison when the
    prison was overcrowded with political prisoners in the days following the
    Ashura arrests (ABF interview, November 16, 2011). After that date, Ms.
    Bahrami was transferred to the Women's Ward, and two months later, on 7
    December 2010, to the Methadone Ward (HRANA, 28 Oc
