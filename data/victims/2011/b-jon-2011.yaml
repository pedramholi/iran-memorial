    News of the execution of Mr. Jon B., along with 21 others, was published
    on the website of the Iran newspaper on September 19, 2011. This case was
    related to the transportation and possession of narcotics and importing
    them into the prison. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Jon B.
    s arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary
    Court tried Mr. Jon B. No information is available on his trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Jon B. was announced as transporting
    narcotics into the prison. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Jon B. was possession of 425
    grams of heroin. Defense No information is available on Mr. Jon B. s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court condemned Mr. Jon B. to
    death and the General Public Prosecutor s Office confirmed the ruling. He
    was hanged, along with 21 others, either at the Evin Prison yard in Tehran
    or in Gohardasht Prison in Karaj on September 18, 2011.
