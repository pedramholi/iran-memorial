    Mr. Nesar Mohammad Kamrani was an upstanding person who everyone liked
    News and information regarding the execution of Mr. Nesar Mohammad
    Kamrani, son of Said Mohammad, have been obtained from an interview with a
    person close to Mr. Kamrani (May 14, 2018) as well as documentation
    provided by this person to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center. News of Mr.
    Kamrani's execution alongside Mr. Ramezan Jamshidi , was also published on
    Fars News Agency, and the website of the Ministry of Justice office of
    Esfahan quoting the public relations office (February 20th, 2011). Born
    near Herat in Afghanistan s Ghourian district, Kamrani immigrated to Iran
    for work in the early 1990s. After residing and working in Tehran for some
    time with his spouse, he moved to Khomeyni Shahr, Esfahan Province. A
    father of four, he earned his living through buying and selling plastic
    and stale bread. A person close to Mr. Kamrani described him as an
    upstanding person who everyone liked. Even the officials of the prison
    where he was held recall him as a decent, innocent man of integrity (ABC
    Interview). Arrest and detention Mr. Kamrani was arrested in 2007/2008 in
    the city of Esfahan. Following his arrest, plainclothes officers conducted
    a search of his home and personal belongings (ABC Interview). Mr. Kamrani
    was severely beaten during his first day of custody; during a visit with
    him the following day, family members noted that he had extensive head and
    body wounds and bloodied clothes. He was held for approximately three
    years in Esfahan Central Prison (ABC Interview). Lacking the financial
    means to appoint a lawyer, he was thus deprived of the right to legal
    representation (ABC Interview). Trial Kamrani was tried in an Esfahan
    court. No information is available on his trial. Charges Mr. Kamrani was
    charged with possession of narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt Evidence brought against Mr. Kamrani included the possession of
    1.968 kilos of compressed heroin (Esfahan Ministry of Justice office and
    Fars News Agency online) as well as Mr. Kamrani s co-defendant s testimony
    against him (ABC Interview). Defense No drugs were uncovered during the
    search of Mr. Kamrani s home that immediately followed his arrest. He
    consistently denied the drug possession charges, and believed his
    co-defendant planted drugs among his belongings in retaliation over a past
    dispute (ABC Interview). Over the course of subsequent investigations into
    Mr. Kamrani s background, officials questioned residents of his
    neighborhood. Interviewed neighbors attested that Mr. Kamrani was a simple
    working man who s never caused us any trouble (ABC Interview). Mr. Kamrani
    s two requests for pardon were denied by judicial authorities. No
    information is available on Mr. Kamrani s defense. A Summary of the Legal
    Defects in the Adjudication of Mr. Nessar Mohammad Kamrani s Case
    According to a person close to Mr. Kamrani, he did not have access to an
    attorney because he could not afford to hire one. This was entirely
    against the law because the presence of an attorney is mandatory in crimes
    that carry the death penalty. Note 1 to Article 186 of the Law on the
    Rules of Criminal Procedure for General and Revolutionary Courts provides:
    If in crimes for which the law has mandated the punishments of Qesas of
    life, execution, stoning, and life imprisonment, the defendant does not
    personally introduce an attorney, it is mandatory that a court-appointed
    attorney be designated for him. Not taking this provision into account
    undoubtedly rendered the trial and, consequently the court s decision,
    null and void. The court s disregard [of said provision] was in complete
    contravention of the law and rendered the ruling, regardless of its
    substance, completely defective and without legal validity. According to
    person close to Mr. Kamrani, he was tortured during interrogations in
    contravention of Principle 38 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic
    of Iran which provides: All forms of torture for the purpose of extracting
    confession or acquiring information are forbidden. Compulsion of
    individuals to testify, confess, or take an oath is n
