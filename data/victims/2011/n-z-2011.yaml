    News of the execution of Mr./Ms. Z. N. a resident of Khoramshahr, along
    with two others, was published on the websites of Semnan Courthouse and
    IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on October 19, 2011, quoting the
    Public Relations Office of the Semnan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention.
    Trial This trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shahrud.
    No further information is available about the defendant s trial. Charges
    The charges against Mr./Ms. Z. N. were announced as "transportation and
    possession of narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr./Ms.
    Z. N. to death and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public
    Prosecutor s Office. The defendant s pardon request was denied by the
    Central Pardon Commission and he was excited in Shahrud prison on October
    19, 2011.
