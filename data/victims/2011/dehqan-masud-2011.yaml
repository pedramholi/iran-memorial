circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Mas ud Dehqan, along with three others, was
    published on the websites of IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on May
    26, and Khabar-e Jonub on May 28, 2011. News of his conviction was
    published on the website of Fars Provincial Courthouse on October 20,
    2009. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. This trial took place in the Penal Court of Fars
    Province. Charges The charge against Mr. Mas ud Dehqan was announced as
    "rape." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defence No information is available on the defendant's defence.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mas ud Dehqan to death and the ruling was
    confirmed by Branch 27 of the Supreme Court. He was hanged at Shahrak
    Golestan in Shiraz on May 26, 2011.
