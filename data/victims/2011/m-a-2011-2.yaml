    News of the execution of Mr. A. M. a resident of Hashtrud, along with four
    others, was published on the websites of IRNA (Islamic Republic News
    Agency) and Semnan Courthouse on December 26, 2011, quoting the Public
    Relations Office of Semnan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. This trial took place
    in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shahrud. The Public Court of Mashhad
    tried this defendant. No further information is available on the defendant
    s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. A. M. were announced as
    "transportation and possession of narcotics." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defence No information is available on the defendant's defence.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. A. M. to death and the ruling was
    confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor s Office. The defendant s
    pardon request was denied by the Central Pardon Committee and he was
    hanged in Shahrud prison on December 26, 2011.
