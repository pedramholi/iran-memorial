    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with another person,
    was published on the website of the Mazandaran Provincial Courthouse on
    May 3, 2011, quoting the Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of Sari. Arrest
    and Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest
    and detention. Trial This trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Sari. No further information is available about the defendant s
    trial. Charges The charge against the defendant was announced as
    "smuggling narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned the
    defendant to death and he was executed in Sari on May 3, 2011.
