    News of the execution of Mr. Hashem Hamidi and four other prisoners was
    published by various sources including Ahwaznews (May 7, 2011,) Al Arabieh
    (May 8, 2011,) the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran (May
    15, 2011,) and Amnesty International (May 23, 2011.) Additional
    information was taken from statements by Amnesty International (June 11,
    2012) and the International Federation for Human Rights (January 4, 2013.)
    Mr. Hamidi was a 16-year-old Khuzestani Arab. International laws have
    strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the
    age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the
    Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence
    committed before the age of eighteen. Amnesty International, the
    International Federation for Human Rights, and the Human Rights
    Organization of Ahvaz issued statements objecting to the execution of Arab
    citizens including Mr. Hamidi following unjust and non-transparent trials
    which disregarded legal standards. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Hamidi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial According to the
    Amnesty International statement, Mr. Hamidi was tried without the presence
    of an attorney in a ten-minute session (The Committee for Defense of
    Political Prisoners, May 23, 2011.) No further information is available on
    his trial. Charges No specific information is available on Mr. Hamidi s
    charges. According to some reports, the charges against him and four other
    defendants were murder of a police agent and two others during the unrest
    in Khuzestan* in April of 2011. According to Amnesty International, these
    defendants may have been tried on charges of Moharebeh ( war against God.
    ) The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Hamidi. Defense
    Mr. Hamidi was 16 years old and younger than legal age. No information is
    available on his defense. Judgment A court condemned Mr. Hashem Hamidi to
    death. The court branch which is issued the judgment and the date of the
    ruling are unknown. No information is available about the confirmation of
    this ruling by the Supreme Court. He was hanged, along with four others,
    at Karun Prison in Ahvaz on May 5, 2011. His body was given to his family.
    According to the Amnesty International statement, Hamidi may have been
    decapitated during the hanging (The Committee for Defense of Political
    Prisoners, May 23, 2011.) ___________________________________ * On April
    15, 2011 - the sixth anniversary of the 2005 protests and shortly after
    the rise of the Arab Spring in the Middle East - Day of Anger
    demonstrations were organized in regions of Khuzestan Province with
    predominantly Arab populations in solidarity with popular movements in the
    region s Arab countries. In Hamidieh and Ahvaz, demonstrations were more
    widespread and were therefore violently quashed by security and police
    forces, resulting in at least twelve dead and more than twenty injured
    (Human Rights Defenders.) Additionally, hundreds of other Arab citizens
    were arrested. International human rights organizations condemned the
    suppression of demonstrations and the ban on news coverage by Iranian
    authorities, and asked the Islamic Republic authorities to allow
    journalists and human rights organizations to independently investigate
    and freely send reports in order to identify the victims of the
    demonstration crackdowns in Ahvaz and other majority-Arab cities in
    Khuzestan (Reporters Without Borders, April 23, 2011; Human Rights Watch,
    April 29, 2011.)
