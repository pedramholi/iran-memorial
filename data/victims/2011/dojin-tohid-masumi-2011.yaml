    News of the execution of Mr. Tohid Ma sumi Dojin, along with two others,
    was published on the website of Mukrian news agency April 7, 2011. Arrest
    and Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest
    and detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges The charge against Mr. Tohid Ma sumi Dojin was announced as "in
    relation to narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available on the defendant's defence. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the defendant s execution. Mr. Tohid Ma sumi Dojin was
    hanged in Orumieh Central Prison on April 7, 2011.
