    News of the execution of Mr. D. S. along with six others was published on
    the websites of Alborz Provincial Courthouse and Central News Unit on
    January 27, 2011, quoting the Central News Unit of the Public and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office in Karaj. Arrest and Detention There is
    no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial
    This trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Karaj. No
    further information is available on this trail. Charges The charge against
    Mr. D. S. was announced as "possession of 397 grams of heroin in the
    prison." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. D. S. to death
    and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. The defendant s pardon
    request was denied by the Judiciary Pardon Committee. He was hanged at
    Qezelhesar prison in Karaj on January 27, 2011.
