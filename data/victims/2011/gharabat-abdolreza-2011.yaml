    News of the execution of Mr. Abdolreza Gharabat was published on the
    websites of Fars news agency on January 31, Al Arabiya on January 29,
    HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on January 28, and Human Rights
    and Democracy Activists in Iran on February 1, 2011. Mr. Abdolreza
    Gharabat, known as Sa ed, joined the Revolutionary Guards in 1980 and
    stayed with them until 2002. His final position was Sardar (General).
    Several members of his family were killed and he was injured during the
    Iran-Iraq war. He suffered from what was called the wave syndrome. He also
    suffered from severe psychological distress. He was commander of the Vali
    asr Division located on the Ahavaz-Andimesh road. He retired in 2002 and
    began teaching ethics. (Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran)
    According to Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran, he had been
    arrested twice before. The first time he was arrested by agents of the
    Intelligence Ministry and transferred to Golf detention center in Ahvaz
    for two months in1998. The second time he was arrested in 2005 and
    transferred to Shushtar prison where he was detained for ten months.
    According to Al Arabiya, quoting a family member of Mr. Gharabat, After
    the war was over, Abdolreza talked about his connection with the Occult
    Imam and claimed that he was dissatisfied with the regime under the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khamenei. His followers gradually increased, and
    several hundred individuals from various cities contacted him and created
    a group known as Conduct and Journey. According to this family member, the
    activities of the group discontinued after targeting the leader of the
    Islamic Republic. Mr. Abdolreza Gharabat was exiled to Ahvaz. Existing
    reports indicate that authorities in the Islamic Republic had been very
    sensitive regarding the case of Mr. Gharabat. As an example, Mohseni Eje
    i, the Chief Public Prosecutor, referred to this execution in Ahvaz and
    associated him with the deviant groups. Arrest and Detention Mr. Gharabat
    was arrested for the last time on the road between Hamidieh and Ahvaz in
    2007. He was transferred to the Karun prison in Ahvaz and detained there
    until he was executed. According to his family, they were rarely able to
    visit him. (Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran) Trial According
    to the Fars news agency, the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz tried
    Mr. Gharabat. (Some other sources indicated that the Special Cleric Court
    tried him.) No information is available on his trial. The media was not
    allowed to cover this case. According to the official Fars news agency,
    the reporter of Fars in Ahvaz tried unsuccessfully to get more information
    from the Public Prosecutor or other officials about this case. The Head of
    Public Relations Office of the Khuzestan Courthouse offered the
    possibility of interviewing the Public Prosecutor and providing
    information to a new reference for the Fars reporter, who was known to
    them, and requesting a permit from the higher ranking officials of the
    judiciary. Charges The charges against Mr. Gharabat were announced as
    "apostate and encouraging corruption." (Fars News- January 31, 2011) The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Gharabat.
    According to the state media and officials, he was accused of claiming a
    connection with the Occult Imam and creating deviant groups. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Gharabat's defense. According to the
    existing reports, it seems that he was only prosecuted for expressing his
    beliefs and having followers. According to Al Arabiya, quoting a family
    member of Mr. Abdolreza Gharabat, We heard the news of Abdolreza s
    execution from the media. We did not expect him to be executed because he
    served well during the war. During the Shah s regime, Abdolreza had no
    religious tendency. However, after the revolution and the start of the
    war, he became a member of the Revoutionary Guards and had a continuous
    presence at the front line during eight years war. This family member
    added, After the war was over, Abdolreza talked about his connection with
    the Occult Imam and announced that the Imam is not satisfied with the
    regime led by Ayatollah Khamene i. The regime promotes ideas regarding the
    Occult Imam and Ahmadinejad has claimed directly and indirectly having
    contact with the Occult Imam several times on television. Why have they
    just executed our son? A Summary of the Legal Defects in the Adjudication
    of Mr. Abdolreza Gharabat s Case According to what little information has
    been published regarding this case, Mr. Gharabat was opposed to the Leader
    of the Revolution, and had also gathered some followers. There was no
    mention of any armed or violent activities by him or his followers in any
    statements made by government officials. His activities were
