circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with five others
    including one Afghan citizen, was published on the website of Human Rights
    and Democracy Activists in Iran on October 16, 2011. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    charge against the defendant was announced as "possession of narcotics."
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant's defense. Judgment No specific information is available
    about the defendant s execution. This defendant was executed at Zahedan
    Central Prison on October 15, 2011.
