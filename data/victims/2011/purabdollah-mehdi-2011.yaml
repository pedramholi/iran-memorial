    News of the execution of Mr. Mehdi Purabdollah, along with 21 others, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on September 19, 2011, and on the website
    of Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran on September 18, 2011.
    Additional information was taken from the same website on September 16 and
    17, 2011. This case was related to the transportation and possession of
    narcotics and importing them into the prison. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Purabdollah was detained for three years. On September 17, 2011, he was
    transferred to solitary confinement either at the Evin Prison or in
    Gohardasht Prison where he was allowed to visit his family. According to
    Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran, seven prisoners could not
    visit their families in person and had to talk to them in booths. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Purabdollah. No information is available on
    his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Purabdollah was
    announced as possession of narcotics. (Iran newspaper) The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Purabdollah
    was possession of 67 kilograms of crack and 36 kilograms of opium. (Iran
    newspaper) Defense No information is available on Mr. Purabdollah s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court condemned Mr. Mehdi
    Purabdollah to death and the General Public Prosecutor s Office confirmed
    the ruling. He was hanged, along with 21 others, either at the Evin Prison
    yard in Tehran or in Gohardasht Prison in Karaj on September 18, 2011.
    Authorities told the families to go to the Kahrizak morgue to receive the
    bodies on September 18, 2011.
