    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with ten others, was
    published on the websites of the Fars Provincial Courthouse on November
    23, and Khabar-e Jonub on November 24, 2011, quoting the Revolutionary
    Public Prosecutor of Shiraz. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial The trials of
    these defendants took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Courts of Shiraz,
    Abadeh, Darab, and Neiriz. No further information is available about the
    defendant s trail. Charges The charges against the defendant and others
    were collectively announced as "possession and transportation of high
    volume narcotics including opium, heroin, crack, and morphine." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned the defendant to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor. The
    defendant s pardon request was denied by the Pardon Committee of the
    Judiciary and he was executed in Adelabad prison in Shiraz in November
    2011.
