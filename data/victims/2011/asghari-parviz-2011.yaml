    News of the execution of Mr. Parviz Asghari, son of Farrokh, along with
    six others, was published on the websites of the Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran on January 11, and IRNA (Islamic Republic
    News Agency) on January 12, 2011, quoting the Information Base of the
    Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial This
    trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran in 2009. No
    further information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Parviz Asghari was announced as "possession of over 6
    kilograms of heroin." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Parviz Asghari to death and he was hanged in Tehran on January 12, 2011 at
    dawn.
