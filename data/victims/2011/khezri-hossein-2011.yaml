    Hossein Khezri had been forced to drop out of school after eighth grade
    due to poverty, and had started to work in a carpet weaving shop in order
    to help his family make ends meet. According to his attorney, he lost 70%
    of his eyesight because of the shop s unfavorable work conditions. News of
    Mr. Hossein Khezri s execution was published by numerous sources including
    IRIB News (January 15, 2011) and HRANA (January 15, 2011). Additional
    information was obtained from Mr. Khezri s letter sent from Orumieh Prison
    (HRANA, January 15, 2011) and other sources.* Mr. Khezri was single and
    resided in [the city of] Orumieh. He had been forced to drop out of school
    after eighth grade due to poverty, and had started to work in a carpet
    weaving shop in order to help his family make ends meet. According to his
    attorney, he lost 70% of his eyesight because of the shop s unfavorable
    work conditions. (Oliayifar interview, Roj Press, November 20, 2010).
    According to this attorney, after fleeing the carpet weaving shop on
    several occasions and because of his hopeless situation, he joined the
    Free Life Party of Kurdistan (PEJAK) when he was still very young, and
    started his activities in the Party s education section. The Free Life
    Party of Kurdistan (PEJAK) is a leftist organization, established in
    December 2003-January 2004, with the goal of [reaching] a democratic,
    ecological, society, with equality of the sexes, in the framework of a
    democratic and federal Iran with autonomy for ethnic minorities. It had
    its first congress on April 25, 2004. Headed by Abdorrahman Haji Ahmadi,
    the Party has close ties to PKK in Turkey and considers Apo (Abdollah
    Ocalan), PKK s leader, its spiritual leader. PEJAK is mostly influential
    in the northern regions of Iranian Kurdistan, and is engaged in armed
    struggle against the Islamic Republic. PEJAK calls Iranian Kurdistan East
    of Kurdistan. A few years after joining PEJAK, Mr. Khezri decided to get
    married and go back to a normal life. Since he had not taken any actions
    against the Islamic Republic, he decided to return to Iran. (Oliayifar
    interview, Roj Press, November 20, 2010). According to his brother, he was
    a nice and personable individual and his social conduct was such that it
    invoked respect by most people. (Jaras, January 15, 2011). His prison mate
    also considers him a kind, devoted, and talented person who was very
    interested in learning, and enthusiastically participated in English
    classes in prison. (Massud Kordpur, Center for the Protection of Victims
    and Detainees Families, December 14, 2011). According to his brother, he
    was not a violent person at all and one cannot accuse him of being a
    terrorist. (Jaras, January 15, 2011, Hossein Khezri s brother). In his
    letter sent to his family from prison, he stated that, instead of repaying
    his debt to his family, he had chosen to repay his debt to his compatriots
    and be the entire society s son. (Hossein Khezri s letter from prison, Roj
    Press, April 25, 2011). While attending the Information Administration s
    News Headquarters to obtain news of his son, Mr. Khezri s father had a
    stroke in front of the Administration building and died at the hospital.
    (Hossein Khezri s letter from prison, HRANA, January 15, 2011). In his
    letter sent to his family from prison, he stated that, instead of repaying
    his debt to his family, he had chosen to repay his debt to his compatriots
    and be the entire society s son. The issuance and the implementation of
    Mr. Khezri s death sentence caused widespread reactions and protests in
    various countries, including Canada, Turkey, Germany, Sweden, and the
    United States. Amnesty International (April 21, 2010, January 14 and 20,
    2011), Human Rights Watch (January 26, 2011), and International Human
    Rights Campaign (January 16, 2011) issued communiqu s and calls to action
    for immediate action against the sentence. In the final protests, the city
    of Amed, Turkey s Mothers of Reconciliation group gathered in front of the
    Iranian Embassy in Ankara. Iranian Kurdish civil society organizations and
    activists also gathered in Iraqi Kurdistan s city of Suleimanieh and
    conducted a protest march. Furthermore, 25 members of Iraqi Kurdistan s
    Parliament issued a statement objecting to Mr. Khezri s execution. (HRANA,
    January 24, 2011). Arrest and Detention Mr. Khezri was arrested by Nabi
