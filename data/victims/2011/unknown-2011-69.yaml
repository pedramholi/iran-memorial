circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown Afghan, along with two others, was
    published on the website of the Iran newspaper on March 7, 2011. Arrest
    and Detention The defendant and two others were arrested after a custodian
    filed a complaint against three men for raping his wife, and one of them,
    a former co-coworker of the husband, was identified by the victim. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges
    against the defendant and two others were collectively announced as
    "rape." According to the Irannewspaper, they entered the custodian s house
    at midnight, and after tying the couple s hands and feet, raped the
    pregnant wife. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against the
    defendant and two others was their confessions and the identification of
    one of them by the victim. Defence No information is available on the
    defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned the defendant to death
    and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Judiciary. The defendant was
    hanged at the Evin prison in Tehran on March 5, 2011.
