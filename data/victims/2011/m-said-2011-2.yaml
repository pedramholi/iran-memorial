    News of the execution of Mr. Sa id M. along with six others, was published
    on the website of the Kerman Provincial Courthouse on March 1, 2011.
    Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s
    arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s
    trial. This trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Bam.
    Charges The charge against Mr. Sa id M. was announced as "participation in
    transporting 6 kilograms of morphine, 5 kilograms of heroin, and 23
    kilograms of crack." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Sa
    id M. to death and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public
    Prosecutor s Office. The defendant s pardon and sentence reduction request
    was denied by the Pardon Commission of Provincial Courthouse and he was
    hanged in Bam prison in 2011. The exact date of this execution is unknown.
