    News of the execution of an unknown individual, along with twelve others,
    was published on the website of IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on
    June 22, 2011, quoting the Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of Mashhad.
    Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s
    arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s
    trial. Charges The charges against the defendant and twelve others were
    collectively announced as "smuggling, transportation, possession, and
    distribution of 6 tons and 96 grams of narcotics including heroin, opium,
    and morphine." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant's defense. Judgment The court condemned the defendant to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Judiciary. The defendant
    was executed in Mashhad Central Prison in 2011. The exact date of this
    execution is unknown.
