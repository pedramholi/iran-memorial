    well-known secular author and journalist in the Republic of Azerbaijan. He
    had written articles on social issues and the effects of religion on
    society and its propagation as a political ideology, in which he had
    criticized the Islamic republic of Iran s influence in Azerbaijan and the
    world. (Lawsuit brought against the Republic of Azerbaijan before the

    Union . Mr. Taqi s daughter, who was very close to her father, says that
    he was a broad-minded and free-spirited man who loved writing very much.
    He would wake up at 5 o clock in the morning so he could have a chance to
    write before work, and he was on his computer, writing enthusiastically,
    on his days off. According to Mr. Taqi s daughter, he liked funny stories
    very much: He would recount a story with great enthusiasm and would laugh
    along with us He would laugh so hard that tears would roll down his eyes
    (English translation of Mr. Taqi s daughter s interview in Ms. Amanda
    Rivkin s weblog, June 7, 2017). Background On November 1, 2006, Mr. Taqi
    published an article in San at newspaper entitled Us and Europe , in which
    he wrote about Europe s human values and considered Islam an obstacle to
    progress: The importance of human freedom in the East is given the lowest
    priority. The human person is deprived of social freedoms and is promised
    imaginary fortunes and happiness through Islam s dark paths. Misery is
    shown as the path to Heaven and as a way out of social quagmires. Islam
    has created hypocritical principles in the structures of Eastern
    countries. The primitive tribal system will lead to the complete
    bankruptcy and disintegration of the East, and will render ineffective
    whatever is left of its progressive social ideas He believed that
    Christianity had resulted in human rights and democracy in the West,
    whereas Islam had turned into Eastern autocracy. He wrote an article in
    which he stated that Azerbaijanis needed to accept secularism if they
    desired freedom. He believed that Christianity had resulted in human
    rights and democracy in the West, whereas Islam had turned into Eastern
    autocracy. Whereas the West is going forward in leaps and bounds, the East
    is going backwards. All of Azerbaijan s efforts in creating a secular
    system are inspired by Europe Our relations with Islamic countries are
    dull and uninspiring, obligatory, and diplomatically artificial. Islam is
    understood by Azerbaijani intellectuals as a symbol of compulsion and
    necessity and a remnant of Eastern violence. In the course of history,
    even in our modern history, Azerbaijani leaders sincere respect for Islam
    has largely been a consequence of their interests stemming from the crown
    Every country in the world is in the process of securing freedom [for
    their people] one way or another. They use Europe as a model when
    considering human rights issues since European values are an unstoppable
    means of progress It was in Europe that mankind was first able to conquer
    himself, to get as far from evil as possible and come close to good.
    [There was also a time when] Europe too went through bloody revolutions,
    but it used those as a valuable experience, and this time, it said no to
    them before anyone else. This article angered a segment of Moslems in the
    Republic of Azerbaijan, particularly in Nardaran County, as well as in
    Iran. The Iranian Embassy in Baku reacte
