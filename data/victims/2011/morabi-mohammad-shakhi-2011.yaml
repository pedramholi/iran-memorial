    The information about Mr. Mohammad Shakhi Mo arabi is based on an
    electronic form sent to Omid (the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation
    memorial) by a person familiar with his case , an announcement by Amnesty
    International (04/19/2011), and a report by the European Human Rights
    Organization in Ahvaz. Additional information was collected from several
    sources including: a letter from Ms. Shirin Ebadi to Ms. Navi Pillay, the
    UN Human Rights Commissioner (04/18/2011), an announcement from Human
    Rights Watch (04/29/2011), the Ahwaz Human Rights Organization, Radio
    Farda (04/18/2011), BBC (04/18/2011), Fars News (04/16/2011), and HRANA
    (04/16/2011). Mr. Mo arabi was a young single Arab from Hamidieh.
    According to the information sent to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation
    (ABF), he had middle school education and was unemployed. Mr. Shakhi Mo
    arabi was killed by security forces in Kui-e Kargaran neighborhood in
    Ahvaz during a demonstration by Arab citizens in Khuzestan on April 15,
    2012. On the week leading up to the anniversary of the 2005 protests -
    according to Human Rights Watch - police and Basij forces had set up a
    series of checkpoints in different cities of Khuzestan, where they
    intended to arrest several of the Arab activists. In an announcement
    published some days after these incidents, Amnesty International mentioned
    that Mr. Mo arabi was thirty-years-old and had been killed in Ahvaz. The
    Officials Reaction Iranian judicial and state authorities did not provide
    a clear explanation about the number or names of those killed during the
    protests of April 2011 in different areas of the province. Fars news
    quoted the commander of the Shadegan Police station that one person was
    killed, and the head of the police station of the Abudi area of Shadegan
    was injured during clashes with "armed insurgents. In another response,
    the temporary leader of Ahvaz Friday prayers, Ayatollah Al-e Kasiri, said
    that people in Khuzestan are separated from limited anti-revolutionary
    groups, affiliated with the west (Fars News 04/16/2011). According to the
    information in Ms. Ebadi s letter to UN Human Rights Commissioner,
    security forces used threats to silence the families of those killed and
    arrested several family members who were interviewed by Arab media. The
    Family s Remarks No information regarding remarks or reactions by Mr.
    Shakhi Mo arabi's family is available. A Summary of the Legal Defects in
    the Adjudication of Mr. Mohammad Shakhi Mo'arabi s Case Pursuant to the
    Law on the Use of Arms by the Armed Forces in Exigent Cases, members of
    the armed forces may use their weapons only under conditions provided for
    by this Law. The Law states that first, use of a weapon must be necessary.
    Secondly, other means of dispersing the crowd must have been utilized, and
    if the objective has not been reached, a weapon can be fired as a last
    resort. As for firing the weapon, a warning must be given prior to firing,
    then a warning shot must be fired [in the air], and only then a shot may
    be fired aiming below the waist; and finally, [if none of the latter steps
    are successful in reaching the objective,] shots can be fired above the
    waist. Furthermore, the officer in question must have physical and mental
    competence, as well as the requisite training and skills [to fire a
    weapon]. In many of the shootings involving protesters, we notice that
    none of these steps and legal requirements are adhered to. The gathering
    in the course of which Mr. Mohammad Shakhi Mo'arabi was shot was by no
    means an armed one. The officers could easily have used other means, such
    as tear gas or pepper spray to disperse the protesters, and if that had
    not brought about the desired result, it was very easily possible to stop
    the targeted person without shooting at the sensitive parts of his body
    such as the head and the chest, and shoot him below the waist. Published
    reports of said demonstrations indicate that there was absolutely no need
    to resort to firing directly [at the subject], and that Mohammad Shakhi
    Mo'arabi's killing was, therefore, illegal. The shooters should have been
    criminally prosecuted. A Summary of the Khuzestan Protests Subsequent to
    the publication of a letter dated July 24, 1998, ascribed to
    then-President Khatami s Chief of Staff, Mohammad Ali Abtahi,
    demonstrations protesting the letter broke out on Friday, April 15, 2005,
    first in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in other cities, such as Mahshahr
    and Hamidideh, and continued for several days. The letter emphasized the
    modification of Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab population through
    promotion and encouragement of the migration of non-native populations to
    the province, [thus] reducing Khuzestan s Arab population to one third of
    the total population of the province. Although the government s
    spokesperson officially denied [the existence of] this letter on Saturday,
    April 16, the demonstrations that had been called for by the Coordination
    Committee for Popular Protests in Ahvaz * continued exte
