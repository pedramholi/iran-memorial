    News of the execution of Mr. M. S., along with three others, was published
    on the website of the Hormozgan Courthouse on April 21, 2011, quoting the
    Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan Courthouse, IRNA (Islamic
    Republic News Agency) on April 21, 2011, in the Sobhe-Sahel newspaper on
    April 23 and 24, 2011, and in the Neday Hormozgan newspaper on April 23,
    2011. Mr. M. S. was married. His case was related to the rape of a
    17-year-old shepherd girl from a village near Bandar-e Abbas on May 8,
    2009. Arrest and detention Mr. M. S. was arrested by judicial authorities
    after the victim filed a complaint. However, the circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. (Sobhe-Sahel newspaper) Trial Branch
    One of the Criminal Court of Hormozgan tried Mr. M. S. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges According to the Social Deputy of the
    Hormozgan Police, the charge brought against Mr. M. S. was announced as
    rape. (IRNA) According to the Sobhe-Sahel newspaper, Mr. M. S. and another
    person attacked a shepherd girl from behind and harassed her when she was
    returning to her home. The other defendant of this case was not charged
    with rape because before attempting to rape the victim, he had escaped
    upon hearing an approaching motorcycle. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    M. S. was being identified by the victim and her complaint, and his
    confession. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. M. S. s defense. However, according to the victim, both defendants had
    consumed alcoholic beverages. (Sobhe-Sahel newspaper) Judgment Branch One
    of the Criminal Court of Hormozgan condemned Mr. M. S. to death and 80
    lashes. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and the Head of Judiciary
    validated it. He was hanged, along with three others, in public near Dolat
    Park in Bandar-e Abbas on April 21, 2011. The lash ruling against him was
    carried out on the same day. The ruling against the other defendant was
    not published.
