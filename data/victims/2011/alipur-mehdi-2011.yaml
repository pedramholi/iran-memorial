    News of the execution of Mr. Mehdi Alipur, along with three others, was
    published on the websites of IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on May
    26, and Khabar-e Jonub on May 28, 2011. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. This trial took place
    in the Penal Court of Fars Province. Charges The charge against Mr. Mehdi
    Alipur was announced as "rape." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mehdi Alipur to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by Branch 27 of the Supreme Court. He
    was hanged at Shahrak Golestan in Shiraz on May 26, 2011. Mr. Mehdi Alipur
    was 22 years old.
