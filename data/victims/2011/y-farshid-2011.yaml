    News of the execution of Mr. Farshid Y. was published on the websites of
    RAHNA news agency and the Human Rights Reporter Committee on April 19,
    2011. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant s arrest and detention. This defendant had been imprisoned in
    Mashhad prison since 2007. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Farshid Y. was announced
    as "drug trafficking." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant's defense. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the defendant s execution. The court condemned Mr. Farshid
    Y. to death and he was hanged at Vakilabad prison in Mashhad in April of
    2011 without informing his family. After his execution, prison officials
    contacted his family to go to the prison for his body. Mr. Farshid s wife
    and two children resided in Talesh, Gilan.
