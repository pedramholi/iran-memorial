    News of the execution of Mr. Khalil Tajik, son of Faza-Ahmad, along with
    six others, was published on the websites of the Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran on January 11, and IRNA (Islamic Republic
    News Agency) on January 12, 2011, quoting the Information Base of the
    Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial This
    trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran in 2009. No
    future information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Khalil Tajik was announced as "possession of 2
    kilograms and 55 grams of crack." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Khalil Tajik to death and he was hanged in Tehran on January
    12, 2011 at dawn.
