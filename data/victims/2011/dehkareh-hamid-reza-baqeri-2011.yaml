    News of the execution of Mr. Hamidreza Baqeri Dehkareh, along with three
    others, was published on the websites of IRNA (Islamic Republic News
    Agency) on May 26, and Khabar-e Jonub on May 28, 2011. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and
    detention. Trial This trial took place in the Penal Court of Fars
    Province. No further information is available about the defendant s trial.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Hamidreza Baqeri Dehkareh and another
    defendant were collectively announced as "participation in armed
    robberies, kidnapping, robbery, destruction, drinking alcoholic beverages,
    assault and battery, and illegitimate relationships." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Hamidreza Baqeri Dehkareh to death and 15 years imprisonment. The ruling
    was confirmed by Branch 27 of the Supreme Court. He was hanged at
    Kuzehgari Square in Shiraz on May 26, 2011.
