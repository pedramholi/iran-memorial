circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Kh. R., along with another person, was
    published on the websites of Kurdistan Courthouse and IRNA (Islamic
    Republic News Agency) on February 15, 2011, quoting the Public Relations
    Office of the Kurdistan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Kh. R. were announced as "participation in purchasing,
    possession, transportation, and distribution of one kilogram and 600 grams
    of concealed heroin, purchasing, transporting, and possession of 690 grams
    of heroin, and addiction to narcotics." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defence No information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Kh. R. to death and the ruling was confirmed by
    the General Public Prosecutor s Office. The defendant s pardon request was
    denied and he was hanged in Sanandaj central prison on February 15, 2011.
