    News of the execution of Mr. M. H. along with another person, was
    published on the websites of the Kurdistan Courthouse and IRNA (Islamic
    Republic News Agency) on February 15, 2011, quoting the Public Relations
    Office of the Kurdistan Courthouse. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. M. H. were announced as "possession of 166 kilograms and 619
    grams of opium and hashish, selling 32 kilograms of opium and hashish, and
    purchasing 22 kilograms of heroin." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available on the defendant's defence. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. M. H. to death and the ruling was confirmed by the General
    Public Prosecutor s Office. The defendant s pardon request was denied and
    he was hanged in Sanandaj Central Prison on February 15, 2011.
