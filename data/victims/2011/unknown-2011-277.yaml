circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown man, along with three others, was
    published on the website of the Human Rights and Democracy Activists in
    Iran on October 19, 2011. His case was related to narcotics. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of the defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against the defendant was announced as
    possession of narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment This
    individual was hanged, along with three others, at the Esfahan Central
    Prison (Dastgerd) on October 16, 2011.
