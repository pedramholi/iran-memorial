    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad A., along with another person, was
    published on the website of the Central Provincial Courthouse on April 13,
    2011. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant s arrest and detention. Trial This trial took place in Branch
    Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Arak. No further information is
    available about the defendant s trial. Charges The charges against Mr.
    Ahmad A. were announced as " possession and transportation of 120 grams of
    extracted heroin, and possession of 5 kilograms and 65 grams of heroin."
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ahmad A. to
    death and he was hanged in Arak central prison on April 13, 2011.
