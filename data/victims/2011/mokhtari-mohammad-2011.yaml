    Mohammad Mokhtari was proficient in both piano and football. In his last
    Facebook post, he wrote: "O God, let me die standing up, for I am tired of
    living on my knees in humiliation." Information regarding the arbitrary
    execution of Mohammad Mokhtari, son of Esma'il, born in Tehran on
    September 10, 1989, was obtained through an interview with an informed
    source conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC) on June 14,
    2024. Also, HRANA, JARAS, and Fars News Agency published news of his death
    on February 15, 2011. Additional information was gathered from interviews
    with Mohammad's father, Esmail Mokhtari, published on Rooz Online (March
    18, 2011 and February 16, 2014), as well as reports by JARAS (February 22,
    2011), Fars News Agency (February 16, 2011), and "Mostanad88" on Masih
    Alinejad's Instagram page (March 1, 2023.) Mohammad Mokhtari was in his
    final year of Mining Engineering at Shahrood Azad University. He had a
    deep interest in music, especially piano, and soccer. He grew up in a
    religious family with three brothers and a sister. Although a modern young
    man, he observed Islamic practices such as prayer, fasting, and
    participation in religious ceremonies such as those held during Muharram.
    He was politically aware and concerned about social justice. He had become
    aware of student protests during his university years and had participated
    in the 2009 presidential election. He supported the Green Movement and
    rejected the election results. On his Facebook page, he regularly shared
    posts calling for protests on February 14, 2011, and was known to always
    wear a green protest wristband. In his last Facebook post, Mohammad wrote:
    "O God, let me die standing, for I am tired of living on my knees in
    humiliation. According to his brother, "Mohammad loved freedom and he
    loved life. (JARAS, February 22, 2011) Those close to him described
    Mohammad as a courageous, happy, and curious person. (ABC Interview, June
    14, 2024) 2009 Election - Background Election returns from Iran s June 12
    th , 2009, presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected
    with 62.63 percent of the vote. Following the announcement, citizens
    disputing these official results demonstrated in the streets. Text
    messaging services were disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night
    before the election and remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until
    July 1st. On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a
    ban on any gathering of presidential candidates supporters throughout the
    country. The same evening, security forces made a show of strength,
    increasing their presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security
    at polling stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting
    results soon after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the
    Interior that the first returns would not be announced until after the
    morning prayer (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential
    candidates came out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were
    made public, to protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election.
    Candidates Mir Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i,
    Ahmadinejad s competitors in the race, contested the election, alleging
    many instances of fraud. They filed complaints with the Council of
    Guardians, the constitutional body charged with vetting candidates before
    elections take place and approving the results afterwards, requesting an
    annulment and calling for a new election. Before the Council of Guardians
    could review their claims, however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah
    Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad on his re-election. In the meantime,
    many people active in Karubi s and Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On
    June 15th, unprecedented demonstrations filled the streets of central
    Tehran, in which an estimated three million protestors participated,
    according to statements attributed to the mayor of Tehran. As the
    demonstrations were ending, paramilitary forces attacked the marchers,
    injuring and killing several people. To prevent such news from being
    broadcast, the Iranian government expelled foreign journalists from the
    country and banned news agencies from reporting on the events. Over the
    next three days, protesters took part in peaceful demonstrations in
    Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on June 19th after Ayatollah
    Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced his support for
    Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were responsible for any
    disorder and its consequences. Amnesty International stated that the
    speech gave legitimacy to police brutality. The next day and thereafter,
    police and plainclothes paramilitary groups attacked the protesters.
    Public gatherings of any kind were declared illegal, and police,
    motorcycle-riding special units wearing black uniforms and helmets, and
    plainclothes agents brutally enforced this restriction. Individuals in
    civilian clothing, commonly referred to as plainclothes forces , are used
