circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown person, along with eight others, was
    published on the website of Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran
    on September 15, 2011. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges No information is available
    on the defendant s charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant's defense. Judgment No specific information is available
    about the defendant s execution. This defendant and four others were
    hanged in Taybad Central Prison on September 15, 2011.
