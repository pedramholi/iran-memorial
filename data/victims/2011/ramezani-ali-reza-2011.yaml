    News of the execution of Mr. Alireza Ramezani, along with nine others, was
    published on the websites of the Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s Office
    in Tehran and ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on January 19, and the
    Kayhan newspaper on January 20, 2011, quoting the Information Base of the
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention.
    Trial This trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran.
    No further information is available about the defendant s trial. Charges
    The charges against Mr. Ramezani were announced as "transportation and
    possession of 500 grams of heroin." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on the defendant's defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Alireza Ramezani to death and confiscation of his
    belongings, and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor
    s Office. The defendant s pardon request was denied by the Pardon
    Commission of the Judiciary and he was hanged in Raja ishahr prison in
    Karaj on January 19, 2011.
