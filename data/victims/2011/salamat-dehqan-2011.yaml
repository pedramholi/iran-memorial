    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center was informed of the execution of Mr. Dehqan
    Salamat, son of Tofiq, by one of his acquaintances who completed the
    Center s special electronic form (April 24, 2018). In addition, news of
    the execution of Mr. Dehghan Salamat, along with five other individuals,
    was announced by the website of Kurdpa (September 11, 2011). Additional
    information on this case was obtained from the website of Human Rights
    Activists for Democracy in Iran (September 11, 2011), and the news outlet
    of the Society for Defending Azari Political Prisoners in Iran ADAP
    (September 13, 2011). Mr. Salamat, born in 1966, was from the village of
    Suma-ye Baradoust in West Azarbaijan. He was married and had five
    children, but also provided for the wife and children of his deceased
    brother (electronic form, April 24, 2018). Mr. Salamat, who had finished
    secondary school, was a van driver and a truck driver s assistant
    (electronic form, April 24, 2018). Mr. Salamat used to have connections
    with the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan and the Komala Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan*, but his case pertains to purchase and sale of illegal
    drugs (electronic form, April 24, 2018). Arrest and detention Mr. Salamat
    was arrested in the city of Orumieh and spent some time in Orumieh Central
    Prison (Darya) (Kurdpa, September 11, 2011; electronic form, April 24,
    2018). However, there is no information available on the details of his
    arrest and detention. Trial There is no information available on the
    details of the session or sessions of Mr. Salamat s trial. Charges Mr.
    Salamat was charged with purchase and sale of illegal drugs (Kurdpa,
    September 11, 2011). The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on details of the evidence of guilt
    entered against Mr. Salamat. Defense Mr. Salamat was the sixth defendant
    of the case, and he had repeatedly denied any knowledge of the existence
    of illegal drugs. His fellow defendants had also testified that he had had
    no knowledge of the existence of the discovered illegal drugs (electronic
    form, April 24, 2018). However, there is no further information available
    on the details of Mr. Salamat s defense. Judgment Mr. Dehghan Salamat was
    hanged, along with five other individuals, in Orumieh Central Prison
    (Darya) in the afternoon of September 10, 2011 (Kurdpa, September 11,
    2011). The body of Mr. Salamat was buried in the border-area village of
    Sarv (electronic form, April 24, 2018).
    -------------------------------------- *During the 1960s, a few of the
    remaining members of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan in Iraq founded the
    revolutionary Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan. Esma il Sharifzadeh,
    Abdollah Mo eini, and Molla Auwrah were among the leaders of this party
    that, inspired by the Cuban Revolution, started their guerrilla campaisn
    in Kurdistan. After the defeat of this movement in 1969 and arrest of many
    of its members, guerrilla tactics were denounced and Maoist methods
    started to dominate the party. In 1979, after the release of some of the
    imprisoned Kurdish leaders, the Revolutionary Organization of the Laborers
    of Kurdistan, or the Komala, was established. Komala, given its Marxist
    approach to politics, was against the local landholders and capitalists,
    and would provoke the workers and farmers of Kurdistan to conduct
    guerrilla warfare against them as well as the central government. Komala
    regarded the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan as the representative
    of the opulent class of the Kurds. As such, it started an extensive
    campaign against the Democrats, which would repeatedly lead to armed
    struggle between the followers of the two parties that left hundreds of
    casualties. In 1982, the Komala coalesced with a Marxist group named
    Sahand whose activities proved to be more in the area of theory to
    establish the Communist Party of Iran. Since then, the organization
    changed its name to the Kurdistan Organization of the Communist Party of
    Iran Komala. However, in the coming years, Komala would withdraw from the
    Communist Party of Iran and then splinter into different cells, which
    include the Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan, led by Abdollah Mohtadi,
    and Komala the Kurdistan Organization of the Communist Party of Iran, led
    by Ibrahim Alizadeh.
