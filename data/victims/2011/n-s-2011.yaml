    News of the execution of Mr. S. N., along with three others, was published
    on the website of the Hormozgan Courthouse on April 21, 2011, quoting the
    Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan Courthouse, IRNA (Islamic
    Republic News Agency) on April 21, 2011, in the Sobhe-Sahel newspaper on
    April 23 and 24, 2011, and in the Neday Hormozgan newspaper on April 23,
    2011. Additional information was taken from the Amin-e Jame eh website on
    January 17, 2009. Mr. S. N. was single. His case was related, along with
    that of two other defendants, to the rape and murder of a 15-year-old boy
    at Dolat Park in Bandar-e Abbas on November 29, 2008. Arrest and detention
    Mr. S. N. was arrested, along with two others, as a follow-up by the
    inspector of Branch One of the Public Prosecutor s Office and the police
    several months after the incident (Hormozgan Courthouse). Agents of the
    Criminal Intelligence Police of the Hormozgan Province participated in his
    arrests (Amin-e Jame eh). However, the circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch One of the Criminal Court of
    Hormozgan tried Mr. S. N. and two other defendants. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges According to the Public Relations Office
    of the Hormozgan Courthouse, the charges brought against Mr. S. N. and two
    other defendants were collectively announced as rape (sodomy) and murder.
    According to reports, he took the victim to Dolat Park where two other
    defendants were present. They raped the victim after drinking alcoholic
    beverages. Then they suffocated him with a belt and dropped his body in
    the sea (Hormozgan Courthouse). The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. S. N. was his confession and the confession
    of his collaborators. According to the Public Relations Office of the
    Hormozgan Courthouse, as a follow-up by the inspector of Branch One of the
    Public Prosecutor s Office and the police agents, the defendants confessed
    to their crime during the preliminary interrogations. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. S. N. s defense. Judgment Branch One of
    the Criminal Court of Hormozgan condemned Mr. S. N. to death, and the
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and the Head of Judiciary validated it.
    He was hanged, along with three others, in public near Dolat Park in
    Bandar-e Abbas on April 21, 2011.
