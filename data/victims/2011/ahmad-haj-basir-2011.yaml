    News of the execution of Mr. Hajbasir Ahmad, son of Haj abdolja far and an
    Afghan citizen, along with eight others, was published on the website of
    Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran on September 15, 2011. Arrest
    and Detention There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest
    and detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges The charge against Mr. Ahmad was announced as "smuggling
    narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant's defense. Judgment No specific information is available
    about the defendant s execution. Mr. Hajbasir Ahmad and four others were
    hanged in Tayyebat Central Prison on September 15, 2011. Mr. Ahmad was 40
    years old.
