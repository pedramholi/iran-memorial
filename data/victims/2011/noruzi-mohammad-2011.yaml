    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Noruzi, along with 21 others, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on September 19, 2011 and on the website
    of Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran on September 18, 2011.
    Additional information was taken from the same website on September 16 and
    17, 2011. This case was related to the transportation and possession of
    narcotics and importing them into the prison. Mr. Noruzi, an Afghan
    citizen, was 17 years old when the crime took place. International laws
    have strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were under
    the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the
    Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of
    the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an
    offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Noruzi was detained in the Qezelhesar Prison for two and a half years. On
    September 17, 2011, he was transferred to solitary confinement either at
    the Evin Prison or in Gohardasht Prison where he was allowed to visit his
    family. According to Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran, seven
    prisoners could not visit their families in person and had to talk to them
    in booths. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Noruzi (Iran newspaper).
    No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought
    against Mr. Noruzi. was announced as transporting narcotics into the
    prison. (Iran newspaper) The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Noruzi. was possession of 480
    grams of heroin. (Iran newspaper) Defense Mr. Noruzi was under 18 when the
    crime was committed. No information is available on his defense. Judgment
    The Islamic Revolutionary Court condemned Mr. Mohammad Noruzi. to death
    and the General Public Prosecutor s Office confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged, along with 21 others, either at the Evin Prison yard in Tehran or
    in Gohardasht Prison in Karaj on September 18, 2011. Authorities told the
    families to go to the Kahrizak morgue to receive the bodies on September
    18, 2011.
