    News of the execution of Mr. Mahmud A la i was published on the website of
    IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on March 2, 2011. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. The primary
    trial had taken place in 2009. Charges The charges against Mr. Mahmud A la
    i were announced as "possession of 3.950 kilograms of opium and hashish,
    450 grams of heroin, 80 grams of crack, 133 pipes, and a special scale for
    narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defence No information is available on
    the defendant's defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mahmud A la i to
    death and the ruling was confirmed by the General Public Prosecutor s
    Office. He was hanged at the Khomeinishahr prison yard in Esfahan on March
    2, 2011. Mr. Mahmud A la i was 24 years old.
