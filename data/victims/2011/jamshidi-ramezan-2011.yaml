    News of execution of Mr. Ramezan Jamshidi alongside Mr. Nesar Mohammad
    Kamrani , was published on Fars News Agency, and the website of the
    Ministry of Justice office of Esfahan quoting the public relations office
    (February 20th, 2011). Additional information was obtained from
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interview with a person who knew about his
    case. (May 14, 2018) Mr. Jamshidi s case was related to drug charges.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Jamshidi was arrested in Esfahan. There no
    information on the details of his arrest and detention . Trial Mr.
    Jamshidi was tried in an Esfahan court. No information is available on his
    trial. Charges Mr. Jamshidi was charged with possession of narcotics. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt Evidence brought against
    Mr. Jamshidi and his co-defendant included the possession of 1.968 kilos
    of compressed heroin (Esfahan Ministry of Justice office and Fars News
    Agency online) (ABC Interview). Defense Mr. Jamshidi s two requests for
    pardon were denied by judicial authorities. No information is available on
    Mr. Jamshidi s defense. Judgment An Esfahan court issued Mr. Ramezan
    Jamshidi s the death penalty, a ruling that was later upheld in Supreme
    Court. Mr. Ramezani was hanged alongside his co-defendant on the 20th of
    February, 2011 in Central Esfahan Prison.
