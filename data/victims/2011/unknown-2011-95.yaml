    The news of an unknown person who was killed along with 11 other Arab
    residents of Khuzestan during the protests of 15 April 2011, quoted from
    Ms. Shirin Ebadi's letter to Ms. Navi Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for
    Human Rights, was published on several websites including Radio Farda (18
    April 2011) and BBC (18 April 2011). On the week leading up to the
    anniversary of the 2005 protests - according to Human Rights Watch -
    police and Basij forces had set up a series of checkpoints in different
    cities of Khuzestan, where they intended to arrest several of the Arab
    activists. Additional information was collected from several sources
    including: an announcement from Amnesty international (4/19/2011); an
    announcement from Human Rights Watch (4/29/2011); the Ahwaz Human Rights
    Organization; Fars News (04/16/2011) and HRANA (04/16/2011). The Officials
    Reaction Iranian judicial and state authorities did not provide a clear
    explanation about the number or names of those killed during the protests
    of April 2011 in different areas of the province. Fars news quoted the
    commander of the Shadegan Police station that one person was killed, and
    the head of the police station of the Abudi area of Shadegan was injured
    during clashes with "armed insurgents. In another response, the temporary
    leader of Ahvaz Friday prayers, Ayatollah Al-e Kasiri, said that people in
    Khuzestan are separated from limited anti-revolutionary groups, affiliated
    with the west (Fars News 04/16/2011). According to the information in Ms.
    Ebadi s letter to UN Human Rights Commissioner, security forces used
    threats to silence the families of those killed and arrested several
    family members who were interviewed by Arab media. The Family s Remarks No
    information regarding remarks or reactions by family is available. A
    Summary of the Khuzestan Protests Subsequent to the publication of a
    letter dated July 24, 1998, ascribed to then-President Khatami s Chief of
    Staff, Mohammad Ali Abtahi, demonstrations protesting the letter broke out
    on Friday, April 15, 2005, first in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in other
    cities, such as Mahshahr and Hamidideh, and continued for several days.
    The letter emphasized the modification of Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab
    population through promotion and encouragement of the migration of
    non-native populations to the province, [thus] reducing Khuzestan s Arab
    population to one third of the total population of the province. Although
    the government s spokesperson officially denied [the existence of] this
    letter on Saturday, April 16, the demonstrations that had been called for
    by the Coordination Committee for Popular Protests in Ahvaz * continued
    extensively in the coming days. In calling for demonstrations, [the
    organizers] highlighted various factors, including the central government
    s policies in expropriating Arab farmers lands for various projects such
    as sugar cane development, and marginalization of, as well as profound
    discontent among, Khuzestan s Arab [population], as a result of the regime
    s efforts to obliterate Arab identity. The demonstrations that had started
    in Kui-e Alavi (Shelangabad/Da ereh),, one of [the city of] Ahvaz s poor
    neighborhoods, quickly spread to the center of Ahvaz and to the cities of
    Mahshahr and Hamidieh. Citing Ahvaz News (a regional news organization)
    and eyewitnesses at the scene, the Ahvaz Human Rights Organization s
    bulletin, dated April 15, 2005, stated, Around three thousand Arab people
    of Ahvaz have gathered together and started extensive but peaceful
    demonstrations in Kordovani Street and Square, along with thousands of
    others in neighborhoods such as Shelangabad, Malashieh, Ameri, and Kut
    Abdollah, among others. Security forces are attacking the demonstrators,
    first with tear gas, and are subsequently firing on them in Da ereh and
    Malashieh neighborhoods. The degree of violence resorted to by security
    and police forces in quashing the demonstrations was such that it led to
    the death of a number of protestors. Dozens more were injured. Subsequent
    to these deaths, the intensity and magnitude of the protests increased. In
    a number of towns, demonstrators proceeded to cut off roads and to occupy
    government buildings and police posts. These protests continued for ten
    days in many Arab regions of Khuzestan. Protestors demanded a government
    apology to the region s Arabs. Official government sources, quoting the
    Islamic Republic s Defense Minister, announced the death toll as standing
    at three or four. (ISNA, April 19, 2005) Civil society activists, however,
    declared the number of people killed during these events to be between 50
    and 60. Amnesty International stated the number as 29; Human Rights Watch
    , 50; and the Ahvaz Human Rights Organization , 160. Dozens of others were
    injured. The Ahvaz General and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office announced
    the arrest and arraignment of 447 individuals. (IRNA, April 25, 2005)
    Local sources, however, announced the number as being greater than 1200.
