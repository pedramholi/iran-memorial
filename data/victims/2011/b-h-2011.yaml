    News of the execution of Mr. H. B., along with three others, was published
    on the website of the Hormozgan Courthouse on April 21, 2011, quoting the
    Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan Courthouse, IRNA (Islamic
    Republic News Agency) on April 21, 2011, in the Sobhe-Sahel newspaper on
    April 23 and 24, 2011, and in the Neday Hormozgan newspaper on April 23,
    2011. Additional information was taken from the Amin-e Jame eh website on
    January 17, 2009. Mr. H. B. was single and 17 years old when the incident
    occurred. His case was related, along with that of two other defendants,
    to the rape and murder of a 15-year-old boy at Dolat Park in Bandar-e
    Abbas on November 29, 2008. International laws have strictly prohibited
    capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time
    of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr. H. B. was arrested, along with
    two others, as a follow-up by the inspector of Branch One of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office and the police several months after the incident
    (Hormozgan Courthouse). Agents of the Criminal Intelligence Police of the
    Hormozgan Province participated in his arrests (Amin-e Jame eh). However,
    the circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch
    One of the Criminal Court of Hormozgan tried Mr. H. B. and two other
    defendants. No information is available on his trial. Charges According to
    the Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan Courthouse, the charges
    brought against Mr. H. B. and two other defendants were collectively
    announced as rape (sodomy) and murder. According to reports, these three
    defendants took the victim to Dolat Park and raped him after drinking
    alcoholic beverages. Then they suffocated him with a belt and dropped his
    body in the sea (Hormozgan Courthouse). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    H. B. was his confession and the confession of his collaborators.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense Mr. H. B. was under 18 years old when the crime was
    committed and he was under the influence of alcoholic beverages. No
    information is available on his defense. Judgment Branch One of the
    Criminal Court of Hormozgan condemned Mr. H. B. to death, and the Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling and the Head of Judiciary validated it. He was
    hanged, along with three others, in public near Dolat Park in Bandar-e
    Abbas on April 21, 2011.
