    Saleh and Mali'e, was born in 1946-47, in Kamyaran County s village of
    Afryan. He finished his primary and high school education in Kamyaran and
    in the city of Kermanshah. He entered Tehran University in 1965-66, and
    after initially studying literature, he obtained a bachelor s degree in
    law. He was married and had two children. He was an attorney in the city
    of Sanandaj before the 1979 Revolution and a member of the Iranian Bar
    Association. (Electronic form, November 14, 2007, Asoyroj website). In the
    1970 s, when the conflict between the farmers of Marivan County s Darsiran
    village and the region s landowners over the distribution of land
    intensified in Kurdistan, Sadiq Kamangar defended the farmers rights as an
    attorney . (Worker-Communist Party of Iran website (May 3, 2018). In the
    course of the Revolution, he became a well-known figure in Kurdistan s
    political struggles. In June-July 1978, he organized the first sit-in
    under the Pahlavi regime at the city of Snanadaj s Judiciary, in support
    of the city s political prisoners who had gone on a hunger strike. In the
    months leading up to the 1979 Revolution, he became a member of the Board
    of the Bar Association and the Iran Jurists Association, and played a role
    in the formation of The City of Sanandaj Teachers Association that same
    year. After the Revolution, Mr. Kamangar became the spokesman and the
    person in charge of the Sanandaj Revolution Council *, and played a
    significant role in organizing protests against the regime. In
    circumstances where, according to Mr. Kamangar, Sanandaj had multiple
    governances, and the Gendarmerie and many other military institutions had
    been disarmed by opponents under his support and other opposition
    activists in Sanandaj, he and a number of other leftist activists formed
    an entity called The Society for the Defense of Freedom and Revolution **
    in that city. Mr. Kamangar later said that this Society intervened in
    executive work and actions. We performed many of the functions of the
    Judiciary. It had gotten to a point where the Judiciary de facto
    recognized our letters and notices as official documents. Even though the
    Road Police (state traffic troopers) were [still in charge] on the
    surface, in practice, we were the ones who carried out their functions.
    Iraj Farzad website (September 5, 2011). Mr. Kamangar was one of the
    leaders and founders of Komala [Party], and subsequently the Communist
    Party of Iran. In 1984-85, Mr. Kamangar and his wife, Ms. Akhtar Kamangar
    who was also a political activist along with the other members of the
    Party, moved to Iraqi Kurdistan. Mr. Kamangar s family, especially his
    parents and one of his young children, were arrested and imprisoned
    several times because of his political activities, and were exiled for a
    time. (Boroumand Center interview, May 4, 2021; the book Highlights of a
    Life , p. 31). Party members and people close to Mr. Kamangar recall him
    as a political leader , a passionate and spirited speaker , a communist
    personality , popular with the workers and the downtrodden people of
    Kurdistan , and describe him as someone who had courage and guts in the
    face of [stark] realities and doubts. (Communist Party of Iran website;
