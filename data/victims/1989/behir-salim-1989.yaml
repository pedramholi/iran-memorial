    Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The
    Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated
    violence in Iran and around the world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic
    Republic operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in
    kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose
    activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of
    extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders
    began in February 1979 and have continued since then, both inside and
    outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far identified over
    540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran.
    Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic
    outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan,
    India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East;
    Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and
    Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean.
    In most cases, there has not been much published, and local authorities
    have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation, evidence, and traces
    obtained through investigations conducted by local police and judicial
    authorities confirm the theory of state committed crimes. In some
    instances, these investigations have resulted in the expulsion or arrest
    of Iranian diplomats. In a few cases outside Iran, the perpetrators of
    these murders have been arrested and put on trial. The evidence presented
    revealed the defendants connection to Iran s government institutions, and
    an arrest warrant has been issued for Iran s Minister of Information. The
    manner in which these killings were organized and implemented in Iran and
    abroad is indicative of a single pattern which, according to Roland
    Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor, contains common parameters and detailed
    planning. It can be ascertained from the similarities between these
    murders in different countries that the Iranian government is the
    principal entity that ordered the implementation of these crimes. Iranian
    authorities have not officially accepted responsibility for these murders
    and have even attributed their commission to internal strife in opposition
    groups. Nevertheless, since the very inception of the Islamic Republic
    regime, the Islamic Republic officials have justified these crimes from an
    ideological and legal standpoint. In the spring of 1979, Sadeq Khalkhali,
    the first Chief Shari a Judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts,
    officially announced the regime s decision to implement extrajudicial
    executions and justified the decision: These people have been sentenced to
    death; from the Iranian people s perspective, if someone wants to
    assassinate these individuals abroad, in any country, no government has
    any right to bring the perpetrator to trial as a terrorist, because such a
    person is the implementing agent of the sentence issued by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court. Therefore, they are Mahduroddam and their sentence is
    death regardless of where they are. More than 10 years after these
    proclamations, in a speech about the security forces success, Ali
    Fallahian, the regime s Minister of Information, stated the following
    regarding the elimination of members of the opposition: We have had
    success in inflicting damage to many of these little groups outside the
    country and on our borders. At the same time, various political, judicial,
    and security officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran have, at different
    times and occasions, confirmed the existence of a long term government
    policy for these extrajudicial killings and in some cases their
    implementation. Read more about the background of extrajudicial killings
