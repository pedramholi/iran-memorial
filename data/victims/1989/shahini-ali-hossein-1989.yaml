    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Hossein Shahini, along with two others,
    was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on February 19, 1989,
    quoting the News Unit of the Public Relations Office of the Supreme
    Judicial Council. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. It took place in Branch 13 of the
    Punitive Court of Bakhtaran. Charges The charge against Mr. Ali Hossein
    Shahini was announced as “murder.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defence No information is available on Mr.
    Ali Hossein Shahini’s defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ali
    Hossein Shahini to death and the Technical Section of the court and the
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in the presence of the
    judicial and security officials in the Dizelabad prison in Bakhtaran.
