    News of the execution of Ms. Soraya Jalalvand, along with four other
    women, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on February 1, 1989.
    Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. It took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Nahavand. Charges The charges against Ms. Soraya Jalalvand were announced
    as “spreading corruption and prostitution, and facilitating it by
    establishing various gangs.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms.
    Jalalvand’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Nahavand
    condemned Ms. Soraya Jalalvand to death and the Supreme Court confirmed
    the ruling. She was hanged in the Nahavand prison.
