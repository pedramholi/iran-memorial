    News of the execution of Mr. Khosro Validokht was published in the Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper on March 26, 1989. Arrest and Detention The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. It took place in the
    Punitive Court of Sari. According to the newspaper report, investigation
    of this case took several months. Charges The charge against Mr. Khosro
    Validokht was announced as “murder.” According to the report, the
    defendant entered the victims’ house at night and a fight broke out. He
    first murdered the father of the family by a knife. Then he murdered two
    children who awakened and recognized him. Only the mother of the family
    survived.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Validokht’s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Khosro Validokht to death and 75 lashes.
    The ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. He was hanged in public in
    Khazar Square of Sari after receiving 75 lashes on March 20, 1989.
    According to the newspaper report, “His body was left hanging from the
    gallows for several hours in order to deter others.”
