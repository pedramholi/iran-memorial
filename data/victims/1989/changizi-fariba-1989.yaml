    Information about Ms. Fariba Changizi was gathered from an electronic form
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a relative and a list of 1988 victims
    published by the Committee to Defend Human Rights in Iran. Ms. Fariba
    Changizi is also listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were reported by that
    organization in a book titled Crime Against Humanity . She is also one of
    1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission s Special
    Representative s Report published on January 26, 1989. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with witnesses and victims families, as
    well as the Bidaran website. * Ms. Fariba Changizi was born in Shiraz in
    1956. She had a bachelor s degree and was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. Her husband, Mr. Mohammad Khakijavan was also a
    sympathizer of this organization and was executed in Shiraz in 1982. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, whether by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. ** Arrest and Detention According to the electronic form report,
    Ms. Fariba Changizi was arrested on April 1, 1983. In a letter dated on
    January 29, 1983, while explaining why she was not allowed to visit, she
    wrote to her child, Hello, my dear little beauty. I hope you are well. I m
    sorry for all your troubles for coming here in the mornings. However,
    there are hopes that the problem will be resolved soon. No further
    information is available on Ms. Fariba Changizi's arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on Ms. Fariba Changizi's trial.
    According to the testimonies of some of the political prisoners who were
    tried during the executions of the summer of 1988, in some of the prisons.
    The trials took place in a room in the prison after a few weeks of
    isolation, during which prisoners were deprived of visitation, television
    and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and September, a
    three-member delegation composed of the public prosecutor, a religious
    judge, and a representative of the Ministry of Information. They asked
    prisoners questions about their views on the Mojahedin, whether they would
    renounce their beliefs and if they were ready to cooperate against the
    Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the prisoners would have been
    charged with counter-revolutionary, anti-religion and anti-Islam, or,
    associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders and would be sentenced to death. The authorities never
    informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose, and the serious
    implications of their responses. During the summer of 1988, according to
    survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or
    Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then-Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed when they were retried and sentenced to death.
