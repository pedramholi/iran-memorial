    News of the execution of Ms. Parvin Derakhshan, along with four other
    women, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on February 1, 1989.
    Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. It took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Nahavand (Hamedan province). Charges The charges against Ms. Parvin
    Derakhshan were announced as “spreading corruption and prostitution, and
    facilitating it by establishing various gangs.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Ms. Parvin Derakhshan’s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Nahavand condemned Ms. Parvin Derakhshan to death
    and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. She was hanged in the Nahavand
    prison.
