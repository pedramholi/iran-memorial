    News of the execution of Mr. Najm Navaser, along with another person, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on February 1, 1989 quoting a
    statement by the Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecution Office in Ahvaz.
    Mr. Najm Navaser was charged with espionage. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    According to the statement by the Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecution
    Office in Ahvaz, "People's cooperation and awareness of the agents of the
    Intelligence Office of the Khuzestan Province resulted in the defendant's
    arrest." Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The
    trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Ahvaz. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Najm Navaser were announced as follows: “1.
    Cooperation with the intelligence and espionage units of the Zionist
    Ba'ath regime of Iraq “2. Espionage and sending Iranian information and
    economy and military news to Iraq's embassy “3. Receiving financial
    support from the Iraq embassy for espionage purposes “4. Membership in the
    separatist groups loyal to the Ba'ath regime of Iraq “5. Attempting to
    organize anti-revolutionary forces in order to establish an espionage
    network for the Ba'ath regime of Iraq.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence provided against the defendant is reported as his own
    "confessions". International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees, and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. DefenSe No information is available on
    Mr. Navaser's defenSe. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Najm Navaser to
    death, and after the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Judiciary
    Council, he was executed in Ahvaz on January 31, 1989.
