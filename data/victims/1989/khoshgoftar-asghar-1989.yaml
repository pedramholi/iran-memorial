    The execution of Mr. Asghar Khoshgoftar, son of Gholam Hossein, along with
    49 other individuals who were executed in 15 different cities on one day
    for drug trafficking, was announced in the communiqué of the Center for
    Combating Narcotics and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March
    2, 1989. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial other than it took place in the Revolutionary Court of
    Qom. Charges The charges against Mr. Asghar Khoshgoftar were announced as
    “continuous participation in the supply and distribution of narcotics
    including more than 2 kilograms and 810 grams of heroin.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law, imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, methadone, or
    morphine). The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution
    mentioned that the defendant had a record of two similar previous
    offences. Defense No information is available on Mr. Khoshgoftar’s
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Asghar Khoshgoftar to death and
    he was hanged in Qom on March 1, 1989.
