    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Heidari, known as Zaman and son of
    Musa, along with 49 other individuals who were executed in 15 different
    cities on one day for drug trafficking, was announced in the communiqué of
    the Center for Combating Narcotics and published in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on March 2, 1989. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial other than it took place in the
    Revolutionary Court of Nishabur (in today’s Khorasan Razavi province).
    Charges The charges against Mr. Heidari, along with another person, were
    announced as “widespread activities in supplying, possession, and
    distribution of narcotics, specifically possession of more than 9
    kilograms of heroin.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law, imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, methadone, or morphine). The exact
    number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Heidari’s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Mohammad Reza Heidari to death and he was hanged in Nishabur
    on March 1, 1989.
