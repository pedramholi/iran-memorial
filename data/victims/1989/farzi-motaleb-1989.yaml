    News of the execution of Mr. Motaleb Farzi was published in the Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper on February 8, 1989 quoting a report by the Special
    Office of the Supreme Judiciary Council. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. It took place
    in Branch One of the Punitive Court of Tabriz. Charges The charge against
    Mr. Motaleb Farzi was announced as “murdering his sister-in-law.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Farzis defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Motaleb Farzi to death. After the ruling was confirmed by
    the Supreme Court, he was executed, in public, in Mianeh (East Azabaijan
    province) on February 7, 1989.
