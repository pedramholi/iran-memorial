    News of the execution of Mr. Davud Gudarzi, along with another person, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on February 2, 1989. Arrest and
    Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. According to the report, the defendant was arrested two years
    before his execution. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. The trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Malayer
    (Hamedan province). Charges The charges against Mr. Davud Gudarzi were
    announced as "repeated adultery and spreading corruption and
    prostitution." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Davud Gudarzi's
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Davud Gudarzi to death and the
    Supreme Judiciary Council confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public in
    the Central Square of Malayer on February 1, 1989.
