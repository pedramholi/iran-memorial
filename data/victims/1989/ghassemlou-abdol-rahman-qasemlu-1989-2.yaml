    He took up arms to defend his people's rights, but he knew that the
    solution for the Iranian Kurdish problem had to be political and not
    military. Information about the assassination of Mr. Abdol-Rahman Qasemlu,
    and two of his companions, Mr. Fadhil Rassoul and Mr. Abdollah Qaderi-Azar
    [Ghaderi-Azar] has been gathered from statements and documents (in Persian

    From World War II to the 1953 Iranian Coup d Etat Abdol-Rahman Qasemlu was
    born in 1930, in the village of Qasemlu, at the outskirts of Orumieh in
    the West Azerbaijan province of Iran. Dr. Qasemlu s life and the history
    of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) are indistinguishably
    tied to each other. His assassination, too, was planned precisely because
    of his central role in the Party. Abdol-Rahman Qasemlu was ten when,
    following the invasion of Iran by the Allied Forces in 1941 and the Soviet
    occupation of Northern Iran, independence movements took shape in
    Azerbaijan (led by Pishevari) and Kurdistan (led by Qazi Mohammad) with
    support from the Soviet Union.** Mr. Qasemlu became interested in politics
    during the reign of Qazi Mohammad in Mahabad and joined the Democratic
    Party of Kurdistan at the age of 15. After the fall of Qazi Mohammad and
    his and his comrades execution by the Iranian army, Abdol-Rahman s father
    sent him to Tehran to continue his education. In Tehran, Qasemlu developed
    an inclination towards communist ideas and became close to the Tudeh
    party. Upon finishing high school, Qasemlu moved to Paris for further
    studies. In 1948, he received a scholarship and moved to Czechoslovakia,
    where he studied at the School of Political and Economic Science, in
    Prague. He identified as a Marxist- Leninist during this time. (Krulich:
    27) After receiving his BA in 1953 (during Mossadeq s term as Prime
    Minister), Mr. Qasemlu returned to Iran and started his activities to
    revive the Democratic Party of Kurdistan, essentially, at the time, a
    branch of the pro-soviet communist Tudeh party. In 1955, the Democratic
    Party of Kurdistan officially severed its organizational ties with the
    Tudeh party. ( Iranica : Qāsemlu) The 1953 Iranian Coup d Etat, which
    reaffirmed the Shah s dictatorship and was followed by intensified
    political pressure and suppression in Iran, led the autonomist Kurdish
    forces to relocate to Iraq. From 1953 Coup d Etat to the 1979 Revolution
    Qasemlu stayed in Iraq for a year, in 1959, and then returned to
    Czechoslovakia to continue studying for his Master s and Ph.D. After his
    graduation, in 1962, he started teaching in the School of Economics in
    Prague. (Krulich: 193-194) Qasemlu was elected Secretary General of the
    Democratic Party at the party s third congress (1973) and stayed in this
    position for the rest of his life. In his capacity as Secretary General,
    and with the help of his comrades, Qasemlu devised a modern and democratic
    agenda for the party and changed its name to the Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI). The Party's slogan became Autonomy for Kurdistan
    and Democracy for Iran. The invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact
    forces in 1968, and the suppression of reformists in that country, led
    Qasemlu away from the Marxist-Leninist ideology and closer to Social
    Democracy. In 1976, Czechoslovakia officials canceled Qasemlu s and his
    family s residency in that country, and he left and took residence in
    Paris. (Krulich: 197) During the Revolution: Armed Struggle and Turning
    Away from It On August 31, 1978, Abdol-Rahman Qasemlu returned to Iran. At
    the time of his return, PDKI had no more than a few hundred members.
    However, in February 1979, a few months after Qasemlu s return, the number
    of members reached 50,000. During Khomeini s stay in Neauphle-le-Ch teau
    (6 October 1978-1stFebruary 1979), in the outskirts of Paris, Qasemlu
    tried to meet with him twice to exchange ideas, but Ayatollah Khomeini
    refused to meet him. (Krulich: 210-211) On March 3, 1979, after 32 years
    of clandestine activities, the PDKI started its public activities in Iran.
