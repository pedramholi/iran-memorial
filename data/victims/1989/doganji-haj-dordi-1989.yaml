    The execution of Mr. Haj Dordi Doganji was reported along with 9 others in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily (July 22, 1980) The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown. Trial
    Based on the report, the verdict was issued by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Gorgan. No specific information about the circumstances of the
    trial is available. Charges The report did not mention the specific charge
    leveled against Mr. Doganji. However, the defendants were collectively
    charged with the following: “continuous and active involvement in
    smuggling drugs and carrying them, armed, from the Eastern provinces to
    the Gorgan region; distributing drugs, particularly a total of more than
    1000 kilograms of opium; participation in smuggling guns and ammunitions;
    and possessing a total of three weapons.” Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain any information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the
    defendant’s defense. Judgment Mr. Doganji along with the rest of the
    defendants was sentenced to death. The report reads as follows: “To
    continue the ultimate battle against ‘death dealers’ and ‘corruptors on
    earth,’ 10 smugglers were hanged in public and in the presence of the
    Hezbollah Umma [community of Muslim people] this morning.”
