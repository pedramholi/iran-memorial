    Mr. Gholam Ali, was born in Esfahan. He was slim and energetic and he was
    interested in books. Information on the disappearance and killing of Mr.
    Sa'id Gholam Ali was published in Lajvar Website, as recounted by Mr.
    Farrokh Haydari, Mr. Gholam Ali s former cellmate (October 24, 2015). Mr.
    Gholam Ali was born in Esfahan. According to Mr. Haydari, Mr. Gholam Ali s
    former cellmate, he was slim, quite energetic, and interested in books.
    Mr. Gholam Ali was a supporter of the Mojahedin e Khalq Organization, and
    he had been incarcerated in Dast Gerd Prison in Esfahan from 1981 to 1986.
    According to Mr. Haydari, he had spent most of his time in prison in
    punitive conditions with few amenities. (Lajvar Website, October 24, 2015)
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as
    its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam
    was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. (1) Disappearance and Death of Mr. Sa'id
    Gholam Ali In early winter of 1989, Mr. Sa'id Gholam Ali and two of his
    former cellmates, Mr. Korosh Ledni and Mr. Mohammad Talebdoost, tried to
    cross the border and join Camp Ashraf (Mojahedin e Khalq Organization) in
    Iraq. Mojahedin Organization members never received news of his safe
    transit (Lajvar Website, October 24, 2015). According to available
    information, Mr. Gholam Ali was an MKO supporter who disappeared within
    the framework of a program within the Islamic Republic s Ministry of
    Information called Al-Ghadir, designed to kidnap and kill MKO members and
    supporters. There is no information regarding him and his fellow travelers
    who had fallen into the trap the Ministry of Information had set up for
    them to join the MKO in Iraq. Available investigations and research shows
    that Mr. Gholam Ali and many others that were kidnapped under this
    program, never reached MKO s camps in Iraq. A few months after Mr. Gholam
    Ali s kidnapping, thousands of prisoners, including members of the MKO,
    who were considered to be maintaining their [ideological] stance , had
    been executed in the course of the Summer of 1988 mass killings. (2)
    According to available information and the statements of Iranian
    officials, it is possible that Mr. Gholam Ali and others who disappeared
    were killed on the basis of that same logic. (Boroumand Center research).
    Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The
    Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated
    violence in Iran and around the world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic
    Republic operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in
    kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose
    activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of
    extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders
    began in February 1979 and have continued since then, both inside and
    outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far identified over
    540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran.
    Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic
    outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan,
    India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East;
    Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and
    Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean.
    In most cases there has not been much published and the local authorities
    have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation, evidence, and traces
    obtained through investigations conduct
