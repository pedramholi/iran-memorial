    The execution of Mr. Reza Ali Zabihi, son of Abdol’ali, along with 49
    other individuals who were executed in 15 different cities on one day for
    drug trafficking, was announced in the communiqué of the Center for
    Combating Narcotics and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March
    2, 1989. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The collective charges brought against Mr.
    Zabihi and seven other individuals, were announced as “continuous and
    persistent drug trafficking, importing narcotics from Zahedan to Tehran
    and Saveh, and possession of more than 32 kilograms of heroin and 3,306
    kilograms of opium.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law, imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, methadone, or morphine). The exact
    number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt According to the newspaper, Mr. Zabihi and seven
    co-defendants “had criminal records including murder, robbery, possession
    of arms, assault, and battery.” Defense No information is available on his
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Reza Ali Zabihi to death and he
    was hanged in Saveh (Markazi province) on March 1, 1989.
