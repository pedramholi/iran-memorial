    Mr. Abolfazl Purhabib is a victim of the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In addition to the
    Marxist-Leninist groups that opposed the Islamic Republic, such as the
    Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) Organization and the Peykar Organization,
    members of organizations who were not opposed to the Islamic Republic,
    including the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), were also
    among the victims of this mass killing. Additional information about Mr.
    Purhabib is taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001 by The
    Tudeh Party of Iran Publications. He was a sympathizer of this party.
    After the Revolution, he joined the Revolutionary Guards, but submitted
    his resignation before the attacks against the Tudeh Party began. The
    Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh's ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The
    Party played a major role on Iran's political scene until it was banned
    following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh
    actively supported Ayatollah Khomeini and his Islamic Republic calling it
    anti-imperialist. Although the Tudeh never opposed the Islamic Republic,
    it became the target of government attacks in 1982 when many members of
    the Party were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown. Mr. Purhabib was arrested in
    June, 1983. Trial There is no information about the trial sessions or its
    location. Also, there is no specific information about the circumstances
    of similar trials that condemned this thousands of other political
    prisoners to death in a few-months period. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in the executions of thousands throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly levelled against
    this defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the victims’
    families refer to the accusations charged against the prisoners
    (accusations that may have led to their execution) as being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the
    Tudeh members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war
    against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available about the defendant’s defence. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrilla troops operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. During the past seven years we
    witnessed that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed
    them to establish contact outside their prisons' walls." Under such
    conditions the families roundly reject the authorities’ claim that these
    prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside Iran. It
    is possible that the prisoners who belonged to the organizations other
    than the MKO were convicted for being “anti-religious”, defending their
    opinion, and refusing to repent. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the defendant’s execution. According to the book The Tudeh
    Martyrs , Abolfazl Purhabib was executed by a firing squad during the mass
    killing of political prisoners in the Evin prison on March 28, 1989.
