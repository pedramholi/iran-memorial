    The execution of Ms. Mehri Siavash, daughter of Mehrab, along with 67
    other individuals, was announced in the communiqué No. 5 of Iran Drug
    Control Headquarters, and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    February 15, 1989. The communiqué states: “This is another warning to
    those who continue their criminal activities, thinking this plan will be
    discontinued after awhile. They dream of continuous import and
    distribution of narcotics among our people, benefiting only the
    international powers. However, they must know that this fight will
    continue until this corruption is uprooted by God’s will and power. Once
    again those who are involved in this business of death are warned to stop
    their actions against the Islamic nation and begin an honest life.
    Otherwise, the Islamic Revolutionary courts will act decisively to try and
    condemn them to death as corruptors on earth and the rulings will be
    carried out immediately without any compassion for these traders death.
    Also, all the public places, hotels, restaurants, and coffee shops are
    warned to avoid serving such people and, if they recognize anyone, they
    must report him to the security forces. Otherwise, they will be treated
    harshly according to the law.” Arrest and Detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charges against Ms.
    Mehri Siavashi were announced as “continuous participation in supplying
    and distributing narcotics, specifically more than 12 kilograms of heroin;
    establishing a prostitution center in Tehran; corrupting young people, and
    upsetting public chastity.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution states:
    “These death merchants collectively distributed 13 tons of opium, 315
    kilograms of heroin, 92 kilograms of hashish and 10 kilograms of morphine.
    Also, a total of two RPG7 with 17 ammunition, 34 combat weapons, and 530
    bullets were recovered from them.” The communiqué states: “In addition to
    these crimes, the defendant also committed other crimes against chastity.”
    No explanation is offered about such crimes. Defense No information is
    available on Ms. Siavashi’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    court of Tehran condemned Ms. Mehri Siavashi to death as a corruptor on
    Earth. She received 125 lashes as punishment before being hanged in public
    on February 14, 1989 in Tehran.
