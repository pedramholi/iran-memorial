    News of the execution of Mr. Mirza Bahadorzehi, along with 80 other
    individuals who were executed in 27 different cities on one day, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March 11, 1988 quoting
    Announcement Number 7 from the Headquarters for Combating Narcotics. This
    execution was reported previously in the same newspaper on March 4. The
    Announcement No. 7 concludes: “The Headquarters for Combating Narcotics
    warns traitors and elements of colonialism and imperialism, who are
    actively involved in importing and distributing destructive narcotics, to
    stop their wicked activities before they are captured by the claws of
    Islamic justice, to surrender to the security forces, to provide all
    information they have on professional smugglers, and help arrest these
    merchants of death. Certainly, the Islamic Revolutionary Court does not
    hesitate to uproot corruptors and distributors of narcotics and will issue
    and execute God’s ruling against them.” Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. It took place
    in the Revolutionary Court of Torbat-e Heidarieh (Khorasan Razavi
    province). Charges The charges against Mr. Mirza Bahadorzehi, along with
    another individual, were announced as “membership in an armed smuggling
    gang, participation in dealing and distribution of narcotics, specifically
    9 kilograms of opium, 12 kilograms of hashish, sedition, and fighting
    against the security forces resulting in the death of a Revolutionary
    Guardsman” ( Jomhuri Eslami , Mar. 4). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, morphine, or
    methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The newspaper report of March 4 did
    not mention any evidence against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Bahadorzehi’s defense. Judgment Based on the court’s
    ruling, Mr. Mirza Bahadorzehi was hanged in Torbat-e Heidarieh.
