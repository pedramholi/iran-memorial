    News of the execution of Mr. Hajimorad Moradi, along with two others, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on February 19, 1989, referring
    to the News Unit of the Public Relations Office of the Supreme Judicial
    Council. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. It took place in Branch 13 of the Punitive Court of
    Bakhtaran. Charges The charge against Mr. Hajimorad Moradi was announced
    as “murder.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defence No information is available on Mr. Hajimorad Moradi’s
    defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hajimorad Moradi to death and
    the Technical Section of the court and the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged in the presence of the judicial and security
    officials in the Dizelabad prison in Bakhtaran.
