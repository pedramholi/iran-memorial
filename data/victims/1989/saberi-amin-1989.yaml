    News of the execution of Mr. Amin Saberi, along with 80 other individuals
    who were executed in 27 different cities on one day, was published in the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper in 1989 quoting Announcement Number 7 from the
    Headquarters for Combating Narcotics. The announcement concludes: “The
    Headquarters for Combating Narcotics warns traitors and elements of
    colonialism and imperialism, who are actively involved in importing and
    distributing destructive narcotics, to stop their wicked activities before
    they are captured by the claws of Islamic justice, to surrender to the
    security forces, to provide all information they have on professional
    smugglers, and help arrest these merchants of death. Certainly, the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court does not hesitate to uproot corruptors and
    distributors of narcotics and will issue and execute God’s ruling against
    them.” Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. It took place in the Revolutionary Court of Mashhad.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Amin Saberi were announced as “intensive
    activity in dealing and distribution of narcotics, specifically 13
    kilograms and 380 grams of opium.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, morphine, or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution states that he had “two
    criminal convictions for the mentioned charges, and conviction to 12 years
    imprisonment and being released by pardon.” Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Saberi’s defense. Judgment Based on the court’s ruling,
    Mr. Amin Saberi was hanged in Mashhad.
