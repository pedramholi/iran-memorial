    News of the execution of Mr. Seyed Rajab Parvandi was published in the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March 5, 1989. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Seyed Rajab Parvandi were announced as “murdering his
    wife and his brother-in-law.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Parvandi’s defense. Judgment Mr. Seyed Rajab Parvandi was hanged in the
    presence of the Public Prosecutor of Bijar, victims’ families, and police
    officers in Bijar (Kordestan province) on March 4, 1989.
