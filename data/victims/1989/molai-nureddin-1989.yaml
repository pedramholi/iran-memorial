circumstances: >
    News of the execution by stoning of Mr. Nureddin Mola’i, along with three
    others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on February 23,
    1989. According to the same source, two other members of this gang had
    been previously stoned. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. It took place in the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Zanjan. Charges The charges against Mr. Nureddin
    Mola’i were announced as “adultery, establishing a gang of corruption and
    prostitution, and taking advantages of women and girls.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mola’i’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Nureddin Mola’i to death by stoning. The Supreme Court and the Supreme
    Judiciary Council confirmed the ruling. He was stoned on February 22, 1989
    in the presence of the religious judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    and some people in Zanjan.
