    The execution of Mr. Nurmohammad Shahbakhsh, son of Mangol, along with 67
    other individuals, was announced in the communiqué No. 5 of Iran Drug
    Control Headquarters, and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    February 15, 1989. The communiqué cautions: “This is another warning to
    those who continue their criminal activities, thinking this plan will be
    discontinued after awhile. They dream of continuous import and
    distribution of narcotics among our people, benefiting only the
    international powers. However, they must know that this fight will
    continue until this corruption is uprooted by God’s will and power. Once
    again those who are involved in this business of death are warned to stop
    their actions against the Islamic nation and begin an honest life.
    Otherwise, the Islamic Revolutionary courts will act decisively to try and
    condemn them to death as corruptors on earth and the rulings will be
    carried out immediately without any compassion for these traders death.
    Also, all the public places, hotels, restaurants, and coffee shops are
    warned to avoid serving such people and, if they recognize anyone, they
    must report him to the security forces. Otherwise, they will be treated
    harshly according to the law.” Arrest and Detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The collective charges
    against Mr. Shahbakhsh and another individual were announced as
    “establishing an armed gang for drug trafficking, carrying five loads of
    opium by camel and car with a total weight of more than 2000 kilograms, of
    which 62 kilograms and 350 grams were recovered; continuous participation
    in selling weapons and ammunition, and having previous convictions for
    similar crimes.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant other
    than what was stated in the Announcement against 68 defendants: “These
    merchants of death collectively distributed 13 tons of opium, 315
    kilograms of heroin, 92 kilograms of hashish and 10 kilograms of morphine.
    Also, a total of two RPG7’s with 17 ammunition, 34 combat weapons, and 530
    bullets were recovered from them.” Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Shahbakhsh’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary court of Yazd
    condemned Mr. Nurmohammad Shahbakhsh to death as a corruptor on earth. He
    was hanged in public on February 14, 1989.
