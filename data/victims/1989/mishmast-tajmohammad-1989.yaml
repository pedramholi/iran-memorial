    The execution of Mr. Tajmohammad Mishmast, son of Delavar, along with 49
    other individuals who were executed in 15 different cities on one day for
    drug trafficking, was announced in the communiqué of the Center for
    Combating Narcotics and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March
    2, 1989. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial other than it took place in the Revolutionary Court of
    Mashhad. Charges The charges against Mr. Tajmohammad Mishmast were
    announced as “widespread activity in the dealing and importing of
    narcotics, including distribution of 70 kilograms of opium and more than 4
    kilograms of heroin.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law, imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, methadone, or morphine). The exact
    number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Mishmast’s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Tajmohammad Mishmast to death and he was hanged in Mashhad
    on March 1, 1989.
