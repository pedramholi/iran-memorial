circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Abdollah Shiri, son of Habibollah, along with 49
    other individuals who were executed in 15 different cities on one day for
    drug trafficking, was announced in the communiqué of the Center for
    Combating Narcotics and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March
    2, 1989. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial other than it took place in the Revolutionary Court of
    Birjand (North Khorasan province). Charges The charges against Mr. Shiri
    were announced as “continuous participation in dealing, possession, and
    distribution of narcotics, possession of 78 kilograms of opium,
    participation in selling and buying weapon and ammunition, possession of a
    Kalashnikov with 3 magazines.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law,
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, methadone, or morphine). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The newspaper reported the defendant had a “conviction
    record for drug dealing, acts incompatible with chastity, and selling
    explosives.” Defense No information is available on Mr. Shiri’s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Abdollah Shiri to death and he was hanged
    in Birjand on March 1, 1989.
