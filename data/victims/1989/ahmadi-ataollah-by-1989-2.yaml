    September 9, 1989); Sarbazan weblog (undated); and Paygah-e Jahani-e
    Terrorism (undated). Additional information about this case was obtained
    from a video interview with Manuchehr Ganji, founder of the Derafsh-e

    the United Nations office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (November

    in [the port town of] Bandar Gaz in Mazandaran Province. He was a colonel
    in the Iran Imperial Armed Forces who had graduated in 1957-58 from the
    Officers School, and was transferred to Bozorg Arteshtaran (
    Commander-in-Chief ) Headquarters ** Second Bureau upon completing
    preliminary training in the field of engineering in 1965-66. After
    completing the intelligence and counter-intelligence advanced program at
    the Command and Headquarters School, he became the head of the
    counter-espionage and counter-intelligence unit. He was then appointed to
    the position of the Head of the Imperial Army s Counter Intelligence
    Department s General Administration for Operations. (Sarbazan weblog,
    undated). After the fall of the Pahlavi Dynasty, Mr. By Ahmadi lived in
    hiding in Iran for a time, and subsequently, secretly left the country and
    went to France. (The article The Nojeh Coup d tat and Iran s Policy ,
    November 2002). He took an active part in the Nojeh Coup d tat*** on 18
    Tir 1359 (July 9, 1980), and after the Coup s failure, he left Iran
    (Sarbazan weblog, undated) and took up residence in Paris, France.
    (Manuchehr Ganji interview, undated). Mr. By Ahmadi was a member of the
    Derafsh-e Kaviani Organization ( The Flag for Freedom of Iran ) and was in
    charge of all of the Organization s activities and programs, including the
    creation and activation of resistance cells against the [Islamic Republic]
    regime, inside Iran. (The book Disobeying the Iranian Revolution: From the
    Shah s Minister to the Head of the Resistance , 2002-03, page 196) The
    Derafsh-e Kaviani Organization carried out several secret operations
    inside Iran, including hacking and interrupting all of Iran s television
    stations at 9 o clock in the evening of September 7, 1986, and
    broadcasting Prince Reza Pahlavi s 11-minute message **** to the people of
    Iran. Mr. By Ahmadi played a role in preparing this operation, and was in
    contact with opposition groups within the Iranian Army; he had secretly
    gone back inside Iran on two separate occasions prior to his
    assassination. (The Washington Post, August 2, 1989). Two of Mr. By Ahmadi
    s sisters were arrested and charged with participating in the Nojeh Coup d
    tat. One of them was executed in Tehran on August 9, 1981. (Sarbazan
    weblog, undated). The Derafsh-e Kaviani Organization The Derafsh-e Kaviani
    Organization ( The Flag for Freedom of Iran ) was a constitutional
    monarchist organization opposed to the Islamic Republic of Iran regime,
    founded in 1987 in Paris, France, by Manuchehr Ganji, Minister of
    Education under Prime Ministers Amir Abbas Hoveyda and Jafar Sharifemami
    [during Mohammad Reza Shah s reign]. At the time of its establishment, the
    Organization also started a radio station in Cairo, Egypt, called The
    Voice of Iran s Derafsh-e Kaviani that broadcast programs in Persian for
    four hours a day. The Organization actively opposed the regime of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran through distribution of audio and video cassettes
    inside Iran, and broadcasting radio programs on Derafsh-e Kaviani Radio.
    In 1998-99, the Derafsh-e Kaviani Organization changed its name to The
    Organization for Human Rights and Fundamental Rights for Iran . Background
    of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic
    Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated violence in
    Iran and around the world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic
    operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in kidnapping,
    disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose activities
    they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial
    killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders began in
    February 1979 and have continued since then, both inside and outside Iran.
    The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings
    outside Iran attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have
    been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
    in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France,
    Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in
    Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases
