    The information about Mr. Mojtaba Mottale Sarab, member of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization (Majority branch), has been drawn from an interview
    with his sister-in-law. A former cellmate has sent additional information
    to Omid via an electronic form. Mr. Mottole Sarab began his political
    activism in the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization during the previous regime. He
    was arrested and condemned to five years imprisonment, but freed in 1979,
    when political prisoners were released from prison. After the 1979
    Revolution, he continued his activism in the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization,
    and when the Organization split, he joined the Majority branch. At the
    time of his arrest, he was an advisor to the central committee of the
    Organization in the Tashkent (Uzbekistan) plenum. Mr. Mottale Sarab
    studied medicine in Esfahan University and, having completed the
    course-work, he was an resident intern until dismissed after the Cultural
    Revolution before he could receive his degree. He was married and had a
    child who was born soon after he and his wife were arrested. The family
    looked after the child while Ms. Mottale Sarab was in prison. In a letter
    to his family that he had smuggled out of prison, Mr. Mottale Sarab stated
    that he had three wishes in life, only one of which came true: finding the
    love of his life. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist
    group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements
    of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to
    the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the Organization, which
    had renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic
    Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority considered
    the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime and
    supported it. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic
    targeted its members solely because of their political beliefs. The
    Cultural Revolution began after Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech in March
    1980 and ordered that universities be purged of all those who opposed his
    regime and be transformed into learning environments [as opposed to
    political forums] where an all-Islamic curriculum would be taught. The
    first wave of violence began on April 15, 1980 during a speech by Akbar
    Hashemi Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and
    Minister of Interior] at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech,
    students supporting the regime took control of the University s central
    building and demanded that the university be purged from pro-Shah elements
    and other sellouts. On April 18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution
    issued a communiqu accusing political groups of converting higher
    education institutions into headquarters of discordant political
    activities and naming them as obstacles to the radical transformation of
    the universities. The communiqu gave these groups three days (Saturday
    April 19 to Monday April 21) to shut down their activities in the
    universities. The Council stressed that the decision included libraries
    along with activities related to arts and sports. Political groups, which
    recruited members and had strong support in the universities, refused to
    evacuate. Before the end of the Council s deadline, serious clashes took
    place between leftist groups and Islamist Associations, in opposition to
    the Associations, sometimes supported by security forces and paramilitary
    groups. These clashes, which peaked at the end of the three-day deadline,
    resulted in the deaths of several people and the wounding of hundreds of
    others on university campuses around the country. On April 21, the Islamic
    Republic authorities announced the victory of the Cultural Revolution and
    the closure of all universities in order to Islamicize the curricula. The
    universities remained closed for two years. One of the outcomes of the
    Cultural Revolution was the purging of many university professors and
    students based on their political beliefs. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Mottale Sarab was arrested in his house in Tabriz on September 24, 1986.
    His pregnant wife was also arrested. In a letter to his family, which Mr.
    Mottale Sarab smuggled out of prison, he stated that he was transferred to
    the Joint Committee in Tehran (also known as Tohid prison, which is today
    the Ebrat Museum) where he was tortured. Three days after the arrest, he
    had a visit with his sister-in-law; she remembers that his upper body and
    clothes had blood stains on them. He looked pale and his face muscles
    twitched. She concluded that, based on what she saw, he had been tortured.
    Moreover, his former cellmate confirmed this conclusion, saying that when
    he met Mr. Mottale Sarab, his feet were very swollen. After his execution,
    his family found out that the body appeared very frail, although Mr.
    Mottale Sarab had a strong body before his arrest. During his
    imprisonment, which lasted for about two years, Mr. Mottale Sarab had two
    other visits. These visits took place
