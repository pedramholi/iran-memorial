circumstances: >
    News of the stoning of Ms. Servat Rasuli, along with another person, was
    published in a report about the stoning of four individuals in the Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper on February 23, 1989. This report indicated that these
    individuals had been members of a gang. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. It took place
    in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Zanjan. Charges The charges against
    Ms. Servat Rasuli were announced as “spreading corruption and
    prostitution.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms. Rasuli’s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Ms. Servat Rasuli to death. She was stoned to
    death in Zanjan. The exact date of this execution is not known.
