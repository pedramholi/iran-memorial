    The execution of Mr. Ali Samareh, son of Mashallah, along with 49 other
    individuals who were executed in 15 different cities on one day for drug
    trafficking, was announced in the communiqué of the Center for Combating
    Narcotics and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March 2, 1989.
    Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial other than it took place in the Revolutionary Court of
    Kerman. Charges The charges against Mr. Ali Samareh were announced as
    “continuous participation in dealing and distribution of narcotics,
    possession of more than 770 kilograms of opium.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law, imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, methadone, or
    morphine). The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The newspaper reported that he had a
    criminal record for distribution of narcotics. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Samareh’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ali
    Samareh to death and he was hanged in Kerman on March 1, 1989.
