    The execution of Mr. Habibollah Darvish, son of Haqdad, along with 49
    other individuals who were executed in 15 different cities on one day for
    drug trafficking, was announced in the communiqué of the Center for
    Combating Narcotics and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March
    2, 1989. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial other than it took place in the Revolutionary Court of
    Hamadan. Charges The charges against Mr. Habibollah Darvish, along with
    another person, were announced as “establishing a gang for smuggling of
    narcotics and continuous participation in dealing and distribution of
    narcotics, specifically possession of more than 15 kilograms of heroin
    and14 kilograms of extracted opium.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law,
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, methadone, or morphine). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Darvish’s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Habibollah Darvish to death and he was hanged in Hamadan on
    March 1, 1989.
