    News of the execution of Ms. Aqdas Hesarbu’i, Mr. Ali Reza Toliat and
    another individual, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March
    8, 1989. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. The trial took place in the Public Court of Karaj.
    Charges The charges against Ms. Hesarbui were announced as “adultery, and
    participation in the murder of her husband” along with her co-defendant
    Mr. Ali Reza Toliat. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms.
    Hesarbu’i’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Ms. Aqdas Hesarbu’i to
    death by stoning. The Supreme Judiciary Council confirmed the ruling. She
    was stoned to death by bystanders in Rajaishahr near Karaj. In the
    newspaper report, the date of the execution is not mentioned.
