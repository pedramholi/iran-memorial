    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Hassani, along with three other
    individuals, was published in an interview with the Head of the Abhar
    Court (Zanjan province) by a reporter of the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    February 6, 1989. In explaining the ruling, the Head of the Court said,
    "When part of a human body decays it must be removed to save the whole
    body. The same is true about the human society. When Moslems notice the
    decay in a part of the human society and this decay is spreading, the root
    must be dried out." Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. According to the statement by the Head
    of the Abhar Court, the legal process of these cases finished in 18 days.
    In explaining the speed of the investigation, he said, "As the honorable
    Chief of the Supreme Court mentioned in the Friday prayer, some of the
    cases took long for judicial process and caused dissatisfaction among the
    people. Therefore, Imam said, 'The cases against the criminals should be
    investigated immediately and the necessary rulings must be carried out
    without delaying formalities.' Based on this statement, the judges of the
    Public Prosecution Office in Abhar were able, in cooperation with the
    police and intelligence officers of the city, to make the case, and
    complete and confirm it by the Supreme Judiciary Council in 18 days after
    the arrest." Charges The charges against Mr. Mohammad Hassani were
    announced as "kidnapping and deluding children." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mohammad Hassani's defense. Judgment The court condemned
    Mr. Mohammad Hassani to death and the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme
    Judiciary Council. He was hanged in public in Abhar on January 23, 1989 at
    4 pm.
