    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) in Europe. He was born in
    1952, in Naqadeh, in the West Azerbaijan province of Iran. He finished his
    elementary and high school education in Naqadeh and then moved to Orumieh
    to continue his education in the Orumieh Industrial Vocational School. Mr.
    Qaderi-Azar served his compulsory military service with the Sepah Danesh
    (Literacy Corps), teaching village students. He had a passion for teaching
    and sought employment as a teacher with the Ministry of Education after
    finishing his compulsory service. He had been interested in making art
    since childhood, thus he also completed a two-year apprenticeship at the
    Fine Arts Institute in Tehran, before continuing his job as a high school
    teacher in Naqadeh. According to his comrades, Mr. Qaderi-Azar s love of
    teaching stemmed from his love of service to the disenfranchised children
    of his homeland. Mr. Qaderi Azar became involved in political issues
    during the Islamic Revolution and joined the PDKI after learning about its
    Charter and programs. During his ten year association with the party,
    Abdollah Qaderi Azar held various responsibilities, including the
    management of the party s hospital in Naqadeh and the Naqadeh Committee.
    He also served in the radio department, the financial department, and
    later, the foreign relations department of the party. In 1985, he became a
    member of the Party s central committee and moved to Paris as the party s
    representative in Europe. It was in this capacity that he accompanied the
    Secretary General of the party, Dr. Abdol-Rahman Qasemlu, on a trip to
    Vienna to attend negotiations with representatives of the Islamic
    Republic. ( Kurdistan : 13-14) His companions knew him as a dedicated and
    hardworking comrade. He accompanied Abdol-Rahman Qasemlu, Secretary
    General of PDKI, during all of his European trips and had once told Mr.
    Qasemlu s wife, Nasrin (Helen), Do not forget, dear sister Nasrin, I will
    be with Dr. Qasemlu on the day he will be murdered. (Krulich: 250)
    Historical background When Mr. Qaderi Azar joined PDKI, the party was
    promoting autonomy for Kurdistan, democracy for Iran. Ayatollah Khomeini s
    political program, which sought to establish the Absolute Guardianship of
    the Jurist ( Valayat e Faqih ) and to limit the political freedoms of
    different-minded individuals, was at odds with PDKI s agenda. The latter
    advocated the separation of church and state and, therefore, boycotted the
    referendum for the establishment of the Islamic Republic (30-31st March
    1979). From spring to summer of 1979, armed conflicts ensued between
    supporters of PDKI and forces connected to Ayatollah Khomeini gradually
    intensified. In the election (3 August 1979) for members of the Assembly
    of Experts (restricted Constituent Assembly), Abdol-Rahman Qasemlu, the
    leader of PDKI, earned 80% of the votes in Orumieh and was elected
    representative of that city. On August 18, in a gathering of the members
    of the Assembly of Experts, Khomeini called the PDKI, a terrorist
    association, a corrupted association, and a corrupter association and
    announced Qasemlu as corrupted. ( Sahifeye Nur: 8/253) On August 20, 1979,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, in a message to the people of Kurdistan, banned the
    PDKI for being the party of Satan. ( Sahifeye Nur: 8/257) In this way, the
    Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran blocked the road to any peaceful
    resolution possible for the Kurdish problem. The army was sent to the
    region to suppress the Kurds. The Revolutionary Guard Corps and the army
    fought the Kurdish peshmerga fighters for three months in order to gain
    control over Kurdish cities and more or less succeeded at the end. On
    October 20, 1979, Qasemlu announced in Mahabad that the armed struggle of
    the Kurds would continue in the form of a guerilla warfare. ( Iranica:
    Qāsemlu) For three years after this announcement, the Democratic Party
    forces had control over a si
