    News of the execution by stoning of Mr. Hossein Irantalab was published in
    the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on February 1, 1989. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. It took place
    in the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Bandar Anzali. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Hossein Irantalab were announced as “adultery, membership in a
    prostitution gang, and spreading corruption.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Irantalab’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Hossein Irantalab to death by stoning. After the ruling was confirmed by
    the Supreme Court, he was stoned, in public, in Bandar Anzali on January
    31, 1989.
