    News of the execution of Mr. Khaz'al Baledi, along with another person,
    was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on February 1, 1989 quoting
    a statement by the Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecution Office in
    Ahvaz. Mr. Khaz'al Baledi was charged with espionage. Arrest and Detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    According to the statement by the Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecution
    Office in Ahvaz, "People's cooperation and awareness of the agents of the
    Intelligence Office of the Khuzestan Province resulted in the defendant's
    arrest." Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The
    trial took place in the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Ahvaz. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Khaz'al Baledi were announced as follows: “1. Active
    cooperation with the Zionist Ba'ath regime of Iraq before and after the
    revolution “2. Acquiring explosives through the Ba'ath regime of Iraq and
    exploding the oil pipelines of Ahavaz and Abadan, as well as Darkhovin's
    pumping station “3. Penetration in the imposed war fronts and activity
    against the Islamic forces “4. Having military and espionage training in
    Iraq “5. Membership in the reconnaissance and destruction teams for Iraq’s
    Ba'ath regime in battle fronts of the imposed war “6. Translation of the
    radio transmission conversations of the Islamic forces in the battle
    fronts.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided against the
    defendant is reported as his own "confessions". International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees, and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Khaz'al Baledi's defense. Judgment The court condemned
    Mr. Khaz'al Baledi to death, and after the ruling was confirmed by the
    Supreme Judiciary Council, he was executed in Ahvaz on January 31, 1989.
