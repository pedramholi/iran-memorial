    News of the execution of Mr. Davud Goli, along with two others, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on February 23, 1989. Arrest and
    Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. It
    took place in the Punitive Court of Markazi Province. Charges The
    colletive charges against Mr. Goli and 5 other individuals were announced
    as “kidnapping and adultery.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defence No information is available on Mr. Goli’s
    defence. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Davud Goli to death and he was
    hanged, in public, in the Raja’i Square of Khomein (Markazi province).
