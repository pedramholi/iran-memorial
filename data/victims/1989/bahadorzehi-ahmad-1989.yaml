    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad Bahadorzehi, along with 80 other
    individuals who were executed in 27 different cities on one day, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March 11, 1988 quoting
    Announcement Number 7 from the Headquarters for Combating Narcotics. This
    execution was reported previously in the same newspaper on March 4. The
    Announcement No. 7 concludes: “The Headquarters for Combating Narcotics
    warns traitors and elements of colonialism and imperialism, who are
    actively involved in importing and distributing destructive narcotics, to
    stop their wicked activities before they are captured by the claws of
    Islamic justice, to surrender to the security forces, to provide all
    information they have on professional smugglers, and help arrest these
    merchants of death. Certainly, the Islamic Revolutionary Court does not
    hesitate to uproot corruptors and distributors of narcotics and will issue
    and execute God’s ruling against them.” Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. It took place
    in the Revolutionary Court of Torbat-e Heidarieh (Khorasan Razavi
    province). Charges The charges against Mr. Bahadorzehi, along with three
    other individuals, were announced as “membership in an armed smuggling
    gang, participation in dealing and distribution of narcotics, specifically
    84.3 kilograms of opium, 3.7 kilograms of heroin, and 89 Kalashnikovs,
    sedition, and causing insecurity area near national borders” ( Jomhuri
    Eslami , Mar. 4). The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, morphine, or methadone). The exact
    number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt According to the Headquarters for Combating Narcotics,
    “4 combat weapons were discovered in the possession of the defendants.”
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Bahadorzehi’s defense. Judgment
    Based on the court's ruling, Mr. Ahmad Bahadorzehi was hanged in Torbat-e
    Heidarieh.
