    The execution of Ms. Ma’sumeh Gereftar, daughter of Darmohammad, along
    with 49 other individuals who were executed in 15 different cities on one
    day for drug trafficking, was announced in the communiqué of the Center
    for Combating Narcotics and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    March 2, 1989. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial other than she was tried at the Revolutionary Court
    of Tehran. Charges The collective charges brought against Ms. Gereftar and
    five other individuals, were announced as “drug trafficking, importing and
    distribution of 15 kilograms of heroin and more than 26 kilograms of opium
    from the east of the country to Tehran, having previous criminal records
    for acts incompatible with chastity, robbery, hooliganism, and assault and
    battery.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law, imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine, methadone, or morphine). The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on her defense. Judgment The court condemned Ms. Ma’sumeh
    Gereftar to death and he was hanged in Tehran on March 1, 1989.
