    Sulaymaniyah, in Iraq, Mr. Fazel Rasul completed his primary and secondary
    studies there. At the age of fifteen, he was reportedly arrested and
    tortured, for the first time, because of his political activism in a
    communist organization. At the age of twenty, while studying law and
    political science, he became Secretary General of the Student Union of
    Iraqi Kurdistan (Institut Kurde: 9). After graduation, in 1978, Fazel
    continued his clandestine political activism. He tried to revive the Iraqi
    communist party, along with those militants who had joined the Iraqi Kurds
    in their armed struggle against the central government (KurdishMedia). In
    the late 1970s, Mr. Rasul moved to Beirut, where he worked for a while at
    the Center for Palestinian Studies. This was the time of the Islamic
    Revolution in Iran, and Mr. Rasul, along with many former young leftists
    in the region, became attracted to the revolutionary Islam promoted by
    Iran s new leaders. In 1980, Mr. Rasul moved to Vienna (Austria), where he
    completed his PhD in political science. During the eighties, Mr. Rasul
    maintained relations with Kurdish organizations without adhering to any of
    them. At the time of his murder, Fazel Rasul was editor of the Algerian
    magazine El Hiwar (Dialogue), created by Ahmed Ben Bella, former President
    of Algeria. Mr. Rasul took a particular interest in the resolution of the
    Kurdish question and the end of the Kurds enmity with the Islamic Republic
    of Iran (IRI), to which he was sympathetic. His dual sympathy for the
    Kurds and the Islamic Republic of Iran, prompted the Iranian authorities
    to choose him as an intermediary and to use him in their conspiracy
    against Dr. Abdol- Rahman Qasemlu, the charismatic leader of the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI). Though a friendly Kurd who
    had facilitated the IRI agents' meeting with Mr. Qasemlu, Fazel Rasul was
    not spared by the killers who killed him to eliminate a witness and with
    him any evidence of IRI involvement in the crime. Ahmad Ben Bella, the
    former President of Algeria and the owner of El Hiwar magazine, remembered
    Mr. Fazel Rasul as an amiable, well read, and cultured man, who was, above
    all, a man of dialogue. Historical Background The historical background on
    PDKI and its relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran helps shed light
    on the political motives underlying the triple murder of Vienna. During
    the Islamic Revolution of Iran (1978-1979), the Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI)** was promoting autonomy for Kurdistan, democracy
    for Iran. Ayatollah Khomeini s political program, which sought to
    establish the Absolute Guardianship of the Jurist ( Valayat e Faqih ) and
    to limit the political freedoms of different-minded individuals, was at
    odds with PDKI s agenda. The latter advocated the separation of church and
    state and, therefore, boycotted the referendum for the establishment of
    the Islamic Republic (30-31st March 1979). From spring to summer of 1979,
    armed conflicts ensued between supporters of PDKI and forces connected to
    Ayatollah Khomeini gradually intensified. In the election (3 August 1979)
    for members of the Assembly of Experts (restricted Constituent Assembly),
    Abdol-Rahman Qasemlu, the leader of PDKI, earned 80% of the votes in
    Orumieh and was elected representative of that city. However, on August
    18, in a gathering of the members of the Assembly of Experts, Khomeini
    called the PDKI, a terrorist association, a corrupted association, and a
    corrupter association and announced Qasemlu as corrupted. ( Sahifeye Nur:
    8/253) On August 20, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini, in a message to the people
    of Kurdistan, banned the PDKI for being the party of Satan. ( Sahifeye
    Nur: 8/257) In this way, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran
    blocked the road to any peaceful resolution po
