    News of the execution of Mr. Khosro Qolizadeh, along with two others, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March 8, 1989. Arrest and
    Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The
    trial took place in the Public Court of Karaj. Charges The charge against
    Mr. Khosro Qolizadeh was announced as “murder.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence provided against the defendant was his own “confession”.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Qolizadeh’s
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Khosro Qolizadeh to death and
    the Supreme Judiciary Council confirmed the ruling. He was executed in the
    Shahid Kochu’i prison in Karaj. In the newspaper’s report, the date of the
    execution is not mentioned.
