circumstances: >
    Mr. Shahriar Seifi Sanjabi is among 3208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization whose execution was reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book
    documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. The majority
    of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs.
    Mr. Seifi Sanjabi’s name is also mentioned in the book 67 Massacre by Mr.
    Masud Ansari. Additional information about Mr. Seifi Sanjabi has been sent
    to Omid through an electronic form by an individual familiar with this
    case. He was born in Kermanshah in 1963 and was a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He was a high school diploma in mathematics.
    He was a bright student and had a good sense of humor. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Seifi Sanjabi was arrested in 1984 in Kermanshah. Trial Mr.
    Seifi Sanjabi was tried and condemned to imprisonment. Whether or not a
    second trial condemned him to death is not known. According to the
    available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of
    the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense
    lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee, composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No
    charge was ever publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass
    execution. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the accusations against the prisoners that may have led
    to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the Mojahedin Khalq members as "hypocrites" who do not believe
    in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still
    approve of the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war
    against God" and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves
    in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with
    guerrilla forces operating near the borders, the families submit the
    isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our
    children lived in most difficult conditions. Our visits were limited to 10
    minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. Over
    the past seven years we witnessed that they were denied access to anything
    that would have allowed them to establish contacts outside their prison
    walls." Under such conditions the families reject the claim of the
    authorities that these prisoners were able to engage with the political
    groups outside Iran. Judgment No specific information is available about
    the death sentence. Mr. Shahriar Seifi Sanjabi was executed during the
    mass killings of political prisoners in March of 1989.
