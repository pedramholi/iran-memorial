    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Khan Khosravi, son of Mahmud, along with 49
    other individuals who were executed in 15 different cities on one day for
    drug trafficking, was announced in the communiqué of the Center for
    Combating Narcotics and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March
    2, 1989. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial other than it took place in the Revolutionary Court of
    Bakhtaran. Charges The charges against Mr. Khosravi were announced as
    “active participation in the supply and distribution of narcotics: several
    times he purchased 5,000 kilograms of opium from Zahedan, transported and
    sold it in Bakhtaran; participation in smuggling weapon and ammunition
    including possessing and selling 16 combat weapons.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law, imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, methadone, or
    morphine). The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The newspaper called Mr. Khosravi a
    “professional drug dealer” and reported that he had “several criminal
    convictions for dealing narcotics and escaping from prison.” Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Khosravi’s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Mohammad Khan Khosravi to death and he was hanged in
    Bakhtaran on March 1, 1989.
