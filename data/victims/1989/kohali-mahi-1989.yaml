circumstances: >
    News of the execution by stoning of Ms. Mahi Kohali, along with another

    Ms. Mahi Kohali were announced as “spreading corruption and prostitution.”
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.

    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.

    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
