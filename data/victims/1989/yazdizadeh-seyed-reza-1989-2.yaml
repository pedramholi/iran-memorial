    The execution of Mr. Seyed Reza Yazdizadeh, son of Seyed Qasem, along with
    49 other individuals who were executed in 15 different cities on one day
    for drug trafficking, was announced in the communiqué of the Center for
    Combating Narcotics and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March
    2, 1989. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial other than it took place in the Revolutionary Court of
    Kerman. Charges The charges against Mr. Yazdizadeh were announced as
    “continuous activities in the supply and distribution of narcotics,
    specifically more than 105 kilograms of opium.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law, imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, methadone, or
    morphine). The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the newspaper report,
    the defendant has been arrested for carrying 76 kilograms of extracted
    opium in 1982, but he escaped. At the time of his second arrest, he
    possessed 30 kilograms opium. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Yazdizadeh’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Seyed Reza
    Yazdizadeh to death and he was hanged in Kerman on March 1, 1989.
