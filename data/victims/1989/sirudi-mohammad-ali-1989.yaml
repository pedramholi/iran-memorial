    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Sirudi, along with another
    person, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March 26, 1989.
    Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Mohammad Ali Sirudi was
    announced as “murdering three members of a family.” According to the
    newspaper report, the defendants, residents of Dargaz (Khorasan Razavi
    province), were in-laws of the victims. The motivation for murder was to
    acquire the victims’ belongings. It took place in the village of
    Hazratesoltan near the Nokhandan District of Dargaz. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Sirudi’s defense. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the defendant’s execution. According to the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper, Mr. Mohammad Ali Sirudi was hanged in public in Takhti Stadium
    of Dargaz.
