    The execution of Mr. Khodabakhsh Shahbakhsh, son of Hossein, along with 49
    other individuals who were executed in 15 different cities on one day for
    drug trafficking, was announced in the communiqué of the Center for
    Combating Narcotics and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March
    2, 1989. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial other than it took place in the Revolutionary Court of
    Gonbad (Golestan province). Charges The charges against Mr. Khodabakhsh
    Shahbakhsh were announced as “widespread and continuous activities in
    distribution of narcotics, transporting and selling 12 kilograms of heroin
    from Zahedan to the region.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law, imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, methadone, or morphine). The exact
    number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The newspaper reported that Mr. Shahbakhsh had “5
    previous criminal convictions since 1967 for carrying narcotics, smuggling
    goods, and robbery.” Defense No information is available on his defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Khodabakhsh Shahbakhsh to death and he
    was hanged in Gonbad on March 1, 1989.
