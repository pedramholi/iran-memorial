    A strong-minded young man who rebelled against both his country's despotic
    rule and the dictates of his own political party Mr. Ebadollah Fathi is
    among 3,208 members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) whose
    execution was reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    against Humanity . This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. Supplemental information, including documentation
    regarding Mr. Fathi s execution and burial, was provided to the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) by his brother, Vazir Fathi. Mr.
    Vazir Fathi, who himself was imprisoned for ten years was one of the few
    prisoners that met with Mr. Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, the United Nations
    Special Rapporteur on Iran, in his third visit to Iran in December of
    1992. In his visit with Mr. Galindo Pohl, Mr. Vazir Fathi mentioned his
    brother s execution. Mr. Fathi was born in Rasht. His family was
    politically active. His political beliefs were shaped by the writings of
    Mr. Ali Shariati (a contemporary Iranian revolutionary and sociologist).
    In 1983, he formed a political study group with his friends. He had been
    imprisoned in 1983 at the Revolutionary Guards prison in Rasht for six
    months for these political activities. He was later released on bail due
    to lack of evidence against him. According to the information sent to the
    ABF, Shortly after his release, Mr. Fathi left the country and, under the
    pseudonym Yaser, joined the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in Iraq (MKO). He
    was badly injured in a military operation by a bullet in his chest and a
    piece of shell in his thigh. After the Mojahedin s ideological revolution,
    Mr. Fathi became discontent with the Mojahedin ideology and as a result
    spent three months in a MKO s prison in Iraq. After these three months
    imprisonment, Masud Rajavi (one of the leaders of Mojahedin) personally
    came to speak with him in order to convince him to return to the
    Mojahedin. Mr. Fathi, however, did not agree and ended up leaving the MKO.
    In February of 1989, after five years in Iraq, Mr. Fathi left the camp of
    the Democratic Kordestan Party, where he was staying as a guest, and
    returned to Iran illegally. He began living underground in Rashat and
    immediately purchased a large number of books including all of Shariati s
    writings. Mr. Fathi s brother, who was in Evin prison since February 1983,
    tried to convince him to leave the country. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention Based on
    the supplemental information sent to the Boroumand Foundation, 17 days
    after entering Iran, Mr. Fathi went to visit his parents. On his way back
    from his parents house, Mr. Fathi was identified and attacked by three
    Hezbollah individuals. He tried to escape, but was arrested by the
    Revolutionary Guards and taken to the Navy prison in Rasht. For two months
    in this prison, Mr. Fathi was kept in solitary confinement without any
    visitation and was viciously tortured. Later he was transferred to a
    prison in Tehran for more interrogation and torture. After four months
    imprisonment in Tehran, Mr. Fathi was transferred back to the Navy prison
    in Rasht, where he was again kept in solitary confinement without any
    visitation. Finally, after eight months in solitary confinement, Mr. Fathi
    was allowed to visit his family in December of 1989. The visit was
    conducted from a distance and over a screen, but his family were allowed
    to bring some food and fruits for him and pass it on through
