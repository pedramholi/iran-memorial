circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Hossein Ali Khaza’i, son of Haji Ali, along with 49
    other individuals who were executed in 15 different cities on one day for
    drug trafficking, was announced in the communiqué of the Center for
    Combating Narcotics and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March
    2, 1989. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial other than it took place in the Revolutionary Court of
    Nahavand (Hamedan province). Charges The charges against Mr. Khaza’i were
    announced as “establishing a gang of drug dealers, buying and selling of
    633 kilograms of opium, persistent activities in smuggling weapons and
    ammunition, including selling 3 combat weapons.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law, imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, methadone, or
    morphine). The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The newspaper reported that the
    defendant had “criminal record related to narcotic drug from the time of
    the Revolution until his arrest.” Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Khaza’i’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hossein Ali
    Khaza’i to death and he was hanged in Nahavand on March 1, 1989.
