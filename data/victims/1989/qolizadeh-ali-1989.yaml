    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Qolizadeh, along with 80 other
    individuals who were executed in 27 different cities on one day, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper in 1989 quoting Announcement
    Number 7 from the Headquarters for Combating Narcotics. The announcement
    concludes, “The Headquarters for Combating Narcotics warns traitors and
    elements of colonialism and imperialism, who are actively involved in
    importing and distributing destructive narcotics, to stop their wicked
    activities before they are captured by the claws of Islamic justice, to
    surrender to the security forces, to provide all information they have on
    professional smugglers, and help arrest these merchants of death.
    Certainly, the Islamic Revolutionary Court does not hesitate to uproot
    corruptors and distributors of narcotics and will issue and execute God’s
    ruling against them.” Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. It took place in the Revolutionary
    Court of Tehran. Charges The collective charges against Mr. Ali Qolizadeh,
    along with 26 other individuals, were announced as “continuous
    participation in dealing and distribution of narcotics, specifically 58
    kilograms and 172 grams of heroin, more than one thousand kilograms of
    opium, and 1,770 kilograms of morphine, association with the international
    smugglers, participation in smuggling weapons and ammunition, robbery, and
    acts incompatible with chastity. Some of the defendants had previous
    convictions for the above charges.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, morphine, or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Qolizadeh’s defense. Judgment Based on
    the court’s ruling, Mr. Ali Qolizadeh was hanged in Tehran.
