    Mr. Zahra Bijanyar is among 3208 members and sympathizers of the People's
    Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity. This book
    documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. Additional
    information was drawn from the Bidaran website. Ms. Bijanyar is also one
    of 1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission's Special
    Representative's Report, "Names and particulars of persons allegedly
    executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the period July-December
    1988," published January 26, 1989. The report specifies that although 1000
    names are mentioned, "in all probability" there were several thousand
    victims. "Most of the alleged victims were members of the Mojahedin.
    However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe
    Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among
    the alleged victims." Further information about Ms. Bijanyar’s case was
    sent to Omid via an electronic form by an individual familiar with this
    case. Based on this form, one of Ms. Bijanyar’s former cellmates had told
    her family, that when Ms. Bijanyar returned from her trial she had said,
    “I know that they are going to execute me. They have identified my
    husband’s body; he had been killed during the operation [Mersad] and they
    think I was a part of it too.” On July 22, 1988, the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) forces based in Iraq carried out an attack (The Forugh
    Javidan Operation) in Iran with the aim of overthrowing the government of
    the Islamic Republic of Iran. The attack, which took place near the city
    of Kermanshah, was quelled in 3 days by the Iranian army in an operation
    called Mersad. Arrest and detention No specific information is available
    on Ms. Bijanyar's arrest and detention. Trial The circumstances that led
    to this defendant's execution are unknown. However, relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is the proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving, at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners;
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available regarding the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense
    In their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants
    were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerillas operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed during the past seven
    years that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed
    them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such
    conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that these
    prisoners were able to engage with any political group outside Iran.
    Judgment No sentence was issued publicly.
