circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Qasem Ayashi, son of Baqer, along with 49 other
    individuals who were executed in 15 different cities on one day for drug
    trafficking, was announced in the communiqué of the Center for Combating
    Narcotics and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March 2, 1989.
    Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial other than it took place in the Revolutionary Court of
    Shiraz. Charges The collective charges against Mr. Ayashi, along with four
    others, were announced as “participation in supplying, possession, and
    distribution of narcotics, specifically possession of 11,985 kilograms of
    opium.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law, imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine, methadone, or morphine). The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The
    newspaper called the five defendants “professional smugglers in the region
    with previous criminal records for similar crimes, distribution of
    alcoholic beverages, and attempting to escape during his arrest.” Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Ayashi’s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Qasem Ayashi to death and he was hanged in Shiraz on March
    1, 1989.
