    News of the execution of Mr. Mahmud Qomian Hamadani, along with 80 other
    individuals who were executed in 27 different cities on one day, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper in 1989 quoting Announcement
    Number 7 from the Headquarters for Combating Narcotics. The announcement
    concludes: “The Headquarters for Combating Narcotics warns traitors and
    elements of colonialism and imperialism, who are actively involved in
    importing and distributing destructive narcotics, to stop their wicked
    activities before they are captured by the claws of Islamic justice, to
    surrender to the security forces, to provide all information they have on
    professional smugglers, and help arrest these merchants of death.
    Certainly, the Islamic Revolutionary Court does not hesitate to uproot
    corruptors and distributors of narcotics and will issue and execute God’s
    ruling against them.” Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. It took place in the Revolutionary
    Court of Jiroft or Kohnuj (both in Kerman province). Charges The
    collective charges against Mr. Mahmud Qomian Hamadani, along with three
    other individuals, were announced as “widespread and active participation
    in supply and import of narcotics, specifically heroin.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine, morphine, or
    methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the Headquarters for
    Combating Narcotics, “88 kilograms of heroin was discovered in the
    possession of the defendants.” Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Qomian’s defense. Judgment Based on the court’s ruling, Mr. Mahmud Qomian
    Hamadani was hanged in Jiroft or Kohnuj.
