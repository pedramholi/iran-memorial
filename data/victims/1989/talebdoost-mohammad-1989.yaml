    Mr. Talebdoost was of slight build and he was patient. He loved to play
    soccer. He was quick and he had good technique. Information on the
    disappearance and killing of Mr. Mohammad Talebdoost was published in
    Lajvar Website, as recounted by his former cellmate, Mr. Farrokh Haydari
    (October 24, 2015). Mr. Talebdoost was from the Ghazian area of Bandar e
    Anzali in Gilan Province. His father was a sailor and he had grown up in a
    middle-class family. According to Mr. Haydari, he was of slight build and
    he was patient. He loved to play soccer. He was quick and he had good
    technique. Mr. Talebdoost started his political activities in 1978 with
    membership in The Organization of Pioneer Warriors of Mostaz afin of Iran
    (Cause of the Oppressed). He was arrested in 1982 for his activities, he
    was sentence to 20 years in prison, and he was sent to Dast Gerd Prison in
    Esfahan. While in prison, Mr. Talebdoost became a supporter of the
    Mojahedin e Khalq Organization. In the winter of 1986, he was held in a
    separate building at Dast Gerd Prison in Esfahan, together with a number
    of members and supporters of the Mojahedin Organization. Due to the
    conditions they were held in, he sustained physical injuries to his back
    and to his spine area, such that according to his former cellmat Mr.
    Haydari, Even simple walking in prison and in the exercise yard was very
    difficult for him. Mr. Talebdoost was released from prison on July 23,
    1988, on the condition that he would seek medical treatment. At that time,
    he returned to Bandar e Anzali. In early August 1988, one of the
    information officials in Esfahan called Mr. Talebdoost s home and asked
    his family members to tell him to report to the prison in Esfahan. After
    this phone call, Mr. Talebdoost left Bandar e Anzali and went into hiding
    (Lajvar Website, October 24, 2015). Arman-e Mostaza fin Organization
    Arman-e Mostaza fin Organization was founded in the summer of 1976 before
    the Islamic Revolution. This organization, just like the MKO, were
    followers of Ali Shariati s ideology, and started their ideological
    activities after the revolution by publishing a magazine called Arman or
    Payam-e Mostaz afin . There are a few members in this group and they were
    mainly active in Dezful (in Khuzestan Province). They were against armed
    struggle and their ideological activities lasted until February 1982 when
    their leaders and members were arrested. Although the leaders were not
    executed, some of the members were executed in different cities. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. (1) Disappearance and Death of Mr.
    Mohammad Talebdoost In early winter of 1989, Mr. Mohammad Talebdoost and
    two of his former cellmates, Mr. Saeed Gholam Ali and Mr. Korosh Ladonni,
    tried to cross the border and join Camp Ashraf (Mojahedin e Khalq
    Organization) in Iraq. Mojahedin Organization members never received news
    of his safe transit (Lajvar Website, October 24, 2015). According to
    available information, Mr. Talebdoost was an MKO supporter who disappeared
    within the framework of a program within the Islamic Republic s Ministry
    of Information called Al-Ghadir, designed to kidnap and kill MKO members
    and supporters. There is no information regarding him and his fellow
    travelers who had fallen into the trap the Ministry of Information had set
    up for them to join the MKO in Iraq. Available investigations and research
    shows that Mr. Talebdoost and many others that were kidnapp
