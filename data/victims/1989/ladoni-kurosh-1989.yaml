    Mr. Ladoni was born in Ahvaz. He was arrested for supporting The Cause of
    the Oppressed Organization, and in prison, he joined the Mojahedin e Khalq
    Organization. Information about the disappearance and killing of Mr.
    Korosh Ladonihas been published in Lajvar Website, as recounted by his
    former cellmate, Mr. Farrokh Haydari (October 24, 2015). Mr. Ladoniwas
    born in Ahvaz. Initially, he was a supporter of the Organization of
    Pioneer Warriors of Mostaz afin of Iran (Cause of the Oppressed). He was
    arrested in 1985 for his activities, and he was sent to Dast Gerd Prison
    in Esfahan. In prison, Mr. Ladonibecame a supporter of the Mojahedin e
    Khalq Organization. He was released from prison in the spring of 1988
    (Lajvar Website, October 24, 2015). Arman-e Mostaza fin Organization
    Arman-e Mostaza fin Organization was founded in the summer of 1976 before
    the Islamic Revolution. This organization, just like the MKO, were
    followers of Ali Shariati s ideology, and started their ideological
    activities after the revolution by publishing a magazine called Arman or
    Payam-e Mostaz afin . There are a few members in this group and they were
    mainly active in Dezful (in Khuzestan Province). They were against armed
    struggle and their ideological activities lasted until February 1982 when
    their leaders and members were arrested. Although the leaders were not
    executed, some of the members were executed in different cities. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. (1) Disappearance and Death of Mr. Korosh
    Ladonni In early winter of 1989, Mr. Korosh Ladoniand two of his former
    cellmates, Mr. Saeed Gholam Ali and Mr. Mohammad Talebdoost, tried to
    cross the border and join Camp Ashraf (Mojahedin e Khalq Organization) in
    Iraq. Mojahedin Organization members never received news of his safe
    transit (Lajvar Website, October 24, 2015). According to available
    information, Mr. Ladoniwas an MKO supporter who disappeared within the
    framework of a program within the Islamic Republic s Ministry of
    Information called Al-Ghadir, designed to kidnap and kill MKO members and
    supporters. There is no information regarding him and his fellow travelers
    who had fallen into the trap the Ministry of Information had set up for
    them to join the MKO in Iraq. Available investigations and research shows
    that Mr. Ladoniand many others that were kidnapped under this program,
    never reached MKO s camps in Iraq. A few months after Mr. Ladonni s
    kidnapping, thousands of prisoners, including members of the MKO, who were
    considered to be maintaining their [ideological] stance , had been
    executed in the course of the Summer of 1988 mass killings. (2) According
    to available information and the statements of Iranian officials, it is
    possible that Mr. Ladoniand others who disappeared were killed on the
    basis of that same logic. (Boroumand Center research). Background of
    Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic
    Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated violence in
    Iran and around the world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic
    operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in kidnapping,
    disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose activities
    they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial
    killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders began in
    February 1979 and have continued since then, both inside and outside Iran.
