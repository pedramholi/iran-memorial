    The execution of 6 unknown individuals was announced in the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on February 2, 1989. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. According to the
    report, the defendant was arrested two years before his execution. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant’s trial. The trial took place
    in the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Malayer (Hamedan province). Charges
    The defendants were charged with “perverting youth through the
    establishment of two extensive networks of corruption and prostitution.”
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Sadroddin Razavi's defense. Judgment
    The 6 defendants were executed in Malayer on January 31, 1989.
