    The execution of Mr. Davud Mazina’i, son of Asghar, along with 49 other
    individuals who were executed in 15 different cities on one day for drug
    trafficking, was announced in the communiqué of the Center for Combating
    Narcotics and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on March 2, 1989.
    Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial other than he was tried at the Revolutionary Court of
    Tehran. Charges The collective charges brought against Mr. Mazina’i and
    five other individuals, were announced as “drug trafficking, importing and
    distribution of 15 kilograms of heroin and more than 26 kilograms of opium
    from the east of the country to Tehran, having previous criminal records
    for acts incompatible with chastity, robbery, hooliganism, and assault and
    battery.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law, imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine, methadone, or morphine). The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on his defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Davud Mazinan’i
    to death and he was hanged in Tehran on March 1, 1989.
