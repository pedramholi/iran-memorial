    Mr. Eftekharju was 31 years old. He was a supporter of the People s
    Mojahedin Organization, and he had survived the massacre of Summer 1988.
    Information about the killing of Mr. Hasan Eftekharjoo has been published
    on the People s Mojahedin Organization of Iran website (December 27,
    2016), and the book Neither Life Nor Death , Volume 4 Until the Dawn of
    the Grape, by Iraj Mesdaqi (2004 Edition). Additional information about
    this case was collected from Freedom of Expression website (August 17,
    2019), People s Mojahedin Organization Martyrs Biography (April 7, 2008),
    Begoonah News Network (August 10, 2019), Haghighat e Mana News Network
    (December 30, 2020), and Iran Wire (May 13, 2022). Mr. Eftekharjoo was
    about 31 and he was a supporter of the People s Mojahedin Organization of
    Iran (People s Mojahedin Organization of Iran website, April 7, 2008). He
    spent part of the 1980s in prison, and having served his sentence, he was
    released from Evin Prison on December 4, 1989 ( Neither Life Nor Death ,
    2004; Haghighat e Mana website, December 30, 2020). The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to the split of the
    Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the
    imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with other
    political prisoners. They began to reorganize the MKO and recruit new
    members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. (1) Background of Extrajudicial Killings
    by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long
    history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world.
    Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside
    the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since
    then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has
    so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases, there has not been much published, and
    local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
    evidence, and traces obtained through investigations conducted by local
    police and judicial authorities confirm the theory of state committed
    crimes. In some instances, these investigations have resulted in the
    expulsion or arrest of Iranian diplomats. In a few cases outside Iran, the
    perpetrators of these murders have been arrested and put on trial. The
    evidence presented revealed the defendants connection to Iran s government
    institutions, and an arrest warrant has been issued for Iran s Minister of
    Information. The manner in which these killings were organized and
    implemented in Iran and abroad is indicative of a single pattern which,
    according to Roland Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor, contains common
    parameters and detailed planning. It can be ascertained from the
    similarities between these murders in different countries that the Iranian
    government is the principal entity that ordered the implementation of
    these crimes. Iranian authorities have not officially accepted
    responsibility for these murders and have even attributed their commission
    to internal strife in opposition groups. Nevertheless, sinc
