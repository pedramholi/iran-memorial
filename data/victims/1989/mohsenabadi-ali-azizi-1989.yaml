    The execution of Mr. Ali Azizi Mohsenabadi was reported along with 9
    others in the Jomhuri Eslami daily (July 22, 1980) The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The validity of the criminal
