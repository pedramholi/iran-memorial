    The execution of Mr. Seyed Hassan Sharaf Razavi, son of Hashem, along with
    67 other individuals, was announced in the communiqué No. 5 of Iran Drug
    Control Headquarters, and published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    February 15, 1989. The communiqué states: “This is another warning to
    those who continue their criminal activities, thinking this plan will be
    discontinued after awhile. They dream of continuous import and
    distribution of narcotics among our people, benefiting only the
    international powers. However, they must know that this fight will
    continue until this corruption is uprooted by God’s will and power. Once
    again those who are involved in this business of death are warned to stop
    their actions against the Islamic nation and begin an honest life.
    Otherwise, the Islamic Revolutionary courts will act decisively to try and
    condemn them to death as corruptors on earth and the rulings will be
    carried out immediately without any compassion for these traders death.
    Also, all the public places, hotels, restaurants, and coffee shops are
    warned to avoid serving such people and, if they recognize anyone, they
    must report him to the security forces. Otherwise, they will be treated
    harshly according to the law.” Arrest and Detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The collective charges
    against Mr. Sharaf Razavi and three other individual were announced as
    “establishing a criminal gang, which distributed narcotic drugs, including
    more than 60 kg heroin in 10 and 100 gram packages.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution states: “These death merchants collectively distributed 13 tons
    of opium, 315 kilograms of heroin, 92 kilograms of hashish and 10
    kilograms of morphine. Also, a total of two RPG7 with 17 ammunition, 34
    combat weapons, and 530 bullets were recovered from them.” The communiqué
    states: “the [four] above mentioned individuals had a criminal record, for
    murder, robbery, as well as possession and trafficking of narcotics.”
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Sharaf Razavi’s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary court of Tehran condemned Mr. Seyed
    Hassan Sharaf Razavi to death as a corruptor on earth. He was hanged in
    public on February 14, 1989 in Tehran.
