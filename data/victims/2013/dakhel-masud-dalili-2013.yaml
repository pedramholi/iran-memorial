    Mr. Dalili Dakhel was born in 1961 in the village if Dakhel, near Astaneh
    Ashrafieh in Gilan. His 50 year old father and 17 year old brother were
    shot and killed and their house was set on fire. Information Information
    regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Mas ud Dalili Dakhel, son of
    Ali, was published on the website of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of
    Iran (March 27, September 14, September 18, and 23, 2013, and September 7,
    2017); Beh Guneh website (September 3, 2013); National Council of
    Resistance Women s Commission (September 1, 2017); Women [are] a Force for
    Change (September 1, 2017), quoting the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
    General Office of Public Relations in Mehr News Agency (September 1, and
    5, 2013); and Radio Farda (September 21, 2013). Additional information
    about this case was obtained from the Washington Times English language
    News Agency (September 1, 2013); Khabar Network (September 4, 2013); Fars
    News Agency (September 7, 2013); Defa Moqaddass ( Sacred Defense ) News
    Agency (July 28, 2014); Jamaran website (October 5, 2021); Human Rights
    Watch (July 31, 2009, and April 15, 2011); Foreign Policy magazine
    (December 17, 2013); and Council to Human Rights Association for Migrants
    Rights for Migrants (Perseus) report (October 30, 2013). According to
    available information, Mr. Dalili Dakhel was born in 1961, in the village
    of Dakhel, near Astaneh Ashrafieh, in Gilan Province. He started his
    activities in the Mojahedin Khalq Organization* in 1979, and he was
    arrested in 1981. He was imprisoned for 2 years in Malik Ashtar Prison in
    Lahijan, and he was released in 1983. He was able to rejoin the Mojahedin
    Organization and form a group with his comrades in the suburb of Astaneh
    Ashrafieh. That same year, due to killings and arrests of Mojahedin
    supporters, he escaped to Kurdistan with one of his friends. In
    Kermanshah, they were exposed at the inn where they were staying, and they
    were arrested. They were immediately taken by plane to Rasht and then to
    astaneh Ashrafieh. According to one of his friends, They were tortured
    severely and unbelievably in the Astaneh Ashrafieh torture chambers. In
    court, these two were condemned to death. They escaped one or two days
    before they were to be executed. (Pezhvak Khavari Lahiji) Mr. Dalili
    Dakhel and one of his comrades escaped from prison one day before they
    were to be executed and joined the armed cells of the Mojahedin
    Organization in Gilan. After their great escape, they were directed by
    Mojahedin Organization to carry out harassment and writing propaganda
    pamphlets, rather than participation in widespread propaganda against the
    Iran Iraq War, which had reached its peak in War Week 1984 in Gilan.
    (Pezhvak Khavari Lahiji) In their search for Mr. Dalili Dakhel, the
    Revolutionary Guard pressured his family. When they raided his family home
    in 1986, they shot and killed his 50 year old father and his 17 year old
    brother on the spot, and they set fire to their house. (Pezhvak Khavari
    Lahiji) In 1986, Mr. Dalili Dakhel joined the Mojahedin Organization in
    Iraq. He was trained in the Liberation Army, Mojahedin Organization
    section, and became Mr. Rajavi s bodyguard. He served in this organization
    for 25 years. (Pezhvak Khavari Lahiji) According to available information,
    on September 16, 2011, Mr. Dalili Dakhel left the Mojahedin Organization
    by his own volition and surrendered himself to the Iraqi and United
    Nations Forces under the name Bahman Afrazeh**. The next day, the legal
    counsel for the inhabitants of Camp Ashraf wrote a letter to UNAMI (United
    Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq) in which they reported that Bahman
    Afrazeh and two other people had left Camp Ashraf because they could no
    longer tolerate the restrictive and difficult conditions. In this letter
    they also requested Iraqi officials to respect their rights (Crime Against
    Humanity, book by Mojahedin Organization). The United Nations High
    Commissioner for Refugees and the government of Iraq issued an identity
    card in the name of Bahman Afrazeh. The Mojahedin did not respond to his
    friends in Iran who wanted to contact him and arrange for his transfer to
    Europe. According to available information, after he left the Mojahedin
    Organization, Mr. Dalili Dakhel first went to Hotel Mohajer in Baghdad,
    and then quickly moved to Hotel Mansur in Baghdad. These two hotels are
    used by the International Organization for Refugees, by the government of
    Iraq, and by other Iranian Refugees. From the day he requested asylum in
    Iraq until September 1, 2013, there is no information on Mr. Dalili Dakhel
    that could determine his place of residence. It should be noted that there
    is a difference of opinion between Mr. Dalili Dakhel s friends and
    acquaintances and the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran about his fate
    after he requested asylum. Background In 1986, the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran s leadership, members, and supporters went to Iraq
    after they were expelled from France, and settled
