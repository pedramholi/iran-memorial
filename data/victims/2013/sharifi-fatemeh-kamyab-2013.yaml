    National Council of Resistance) Her brother, Mr. Bijan Kamyab Sharifi, was
    executed by firing squad in Tehran on February 9, 1982, when he was 19.
    Another brother, Esfandiar, was killed during the Forough Javidan
    Operation. At the time [it was decided that] the Ashraf Base* would be
    evacuated in 2013, so that Mojahedin Khalq members could be transferred to
    Camp Liberty** which was under the protection of the United States 100 (or
    101) of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran members remained at
    Ashraf Base, among whom was Ms. Kamyab Sharifi. According to the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization of Iran, she and 99 of her cohorts, none of whom were
    armed , were in charge of selling the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran
    s assets at the Ashraf Base. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization(MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adopted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in an
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive economic and social analysis method but considered Islam their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975 following
    a profound ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology, and after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to the split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977.
    In January 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began re-organizing the MKO and
    recruiting new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities. Still, its
    efforts to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were
    vehemently opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.*** Background In 1986,
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran's leadership, members, and
    supporters went to Iraq after they were expelled from France and settled
    in the Ashraf Base. The Ashraf Base was located north of Diala Province,
