    News of the execution of Mr. Habibollah Riginejad Shuraki and 15 other
    people was reported by several sources including the Ministry of Justice
    of Sistan and Baluchistan Province (October 27, 2013), Fars News Agency
    (October 26, 2013), Central News Agency (October 26, 2013), and HRANA
    (December 11, 2013). Additional information was obtained from an interview
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with one of Mr.
    Riginejad s relatives (ABF interview), his brother interview with the
    Baluchi Activists Campaign, and Mr. Riginejad s letter from Zahedan prison
    addressed to United Nations special rapporteur (October 22, 2012), and
    other resources*. Mr. Riginejad was a young Baluch who lived in Zahedan.
    He had a middle-school education and made his living selling textiles (ABF
    interview). Mr. Riginejad was married and had a three-year-old daughter
    (Riginejad s letter). Background Following the armed attack by Jaish
    ul-Adl* on a border station in Sarvan, Sistan and Baluchistan (Friday
    night, October 25, 2013), as a result of which at least 14 border guards
    were killed and seven injured, the Ministry of Justice of the province
    reported the execution of 16 prisoners on Saturday, October 26. The Public
    and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Zahedan referred to the execution of the
    16 villains connected to enemy groups as retaliation . According to the
    Chief Justice of Sistan and Baluchistan, the execution of these convicts
    had been postponed due to Islamic compassion but due to Jaish ul-Adl s
    assault on provincial border guards and continued cowardly terrorist
    attacks , the sentences were at last carried out (Asrehamoon, Fars News
    Agency). The convicts had been arrested during the few preceding years and
    were not connected to Jaish ul-Adl s armed attack, which took place only a
    few hours before their execution. They faced various charges across
    different cases: according to provincial judicial authorities, eight of
    them had been accused of drug dealing (Ministry of Justice of Sistan and
    Baluchistan). Human rights organizations and activists called this mass
    summary execution a reprisal and protested against the execution of the
    prisoners who were not directly connected to the armed attack. Ahmad
    Shahid, United Nations Special rapporteur on the Human Rights situation in
    Iran, called the execution of these people a kind of retaliation in-kind
    and an illegal act according to international human rights laws. Shirin
    Ebadi, lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, and Sarah Leah Whitson,
    Human Rights Watch expert, also considered the execution of the 16
    prisoners in retaliation for border guards killing as a violation of legal
    norms and an example of the lack of independence of Iran s judiciary. Both
    experts condemned the executions. Amnesty International, Human Rights
    Watch, human rights activists, and the International Federation for Human
    Rights also issued announcements protesting the reprisal. Arrest and
    detention Agents of the Zahedan Ministry of Intelligence arrested Mr.
    Riginejad in Zibashahr, Zahedan on August 31, 2009. They did not possess a
    warrant. Mr. Riginejad was then sent to the detention center of the
    Ministry of Intelligence in Zahedan. Here he was held in solitary
    confinement for a duration of 15 months (Riginejad s letter). During this
    time he was not allowed to call or meet with his lawyer; his only family
    contact was a five-minute meeting with his mother granted after three
    months of detention (ABF interview). After the 15-month solitary
    detention, Mr. Riginejad was transferred to Zahedan Central Prison and
    finally allowed to meet his wife and daughter for the first time in a year
    and a half (ABF interview). Mr. Riginejad reported in his letter from
    prison that he was subjected to regular physical and mental tortured by
    agents of the Ministry of Intelligence during his initial 15-month
    solitary detention. He explained the details of the abuse accordingly: The
    tortures included the miracle bed (one of the most brutal forms of
    torture,) pulling off my toenails, electric shocks, lashing with a cable,
    and mental tortures. Besides this, some soldiers would kick and punch me
    every time I was taken away for interrogation. I was in solitary
    confinement at the Ministry detention center for 15 months, during which
    time I was questioned by the interrogator and the judge himself while on
    the miracle bed. He stated that the purpose of all these tortures was to
    obtain false confessions: In that situation, I had to accept everything
    they said to me. Being in a bad physical and mental condition, I agreed to
    say what they wanted me to in front of the camera. They would give me a
    text to memorize and repeat out loud in front of the camera. They would
    ask me questions and I would answer them (Riginejad s letter). Mr.
    Riginejad was also denied his rights as a prisoner at Zahedan Central
    Prison. He was transferred to solitary confinement on a number of
    occasions for various reasons such as staying in the prayer room of th
