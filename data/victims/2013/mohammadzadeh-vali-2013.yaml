    News of the execution of Mr. Vali Mohammadzadeh, along with ten others of
    whom four were unknown and two were female, was published on the website
    of Mukrian news agency on October 30, 2013 and on the website of HRANA
    (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on November 4, 2013. He was a Kurd.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Mohammadzadeh s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Mohammadzadeh s trial. Charges According to reports, the charge brought
    against Mr. Mohammadzadeh was announced as selling narcotics. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Mohammadzadeh. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Mohammadzadeh s defense. Judgment Mr. Vali Mohammadzadeh was
    hanged, along with six others, in the Orumieh Central Prison on Wednesday
    October 30, 2013.
