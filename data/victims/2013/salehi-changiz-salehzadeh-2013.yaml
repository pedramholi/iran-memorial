    News of the execution of Mr. Changiz Salehzadeh (Salehi), son of Kamal,
    along with two others, was published on the websites of HRANA (Human
    Rights Activists News Agency), Kurdpa News Agency on December 19, 2013,
    and, along with 17 others, on the website of Mukrian news agency on
    December 18, 2013. He was a Kurd, 30, from the Disej-Mergur village in
    Ajerbaijan-e Gharbi. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Salehzadeh (Salehi) s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Salehzadeh (Salehi) s trial. Charges
    According to HRANA, the charge brought against Mr. Salehzadeh (Salehi) was
    announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Salehzadeh (Salehi). Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Salehzadeh (Salehi) s defense. Judgment Mr. Changiz
    Salehzadeh (Salehi) was hanged, along with two others, in the Orumieh
    Central Prison yard on Wednesday December 18, 2013.
