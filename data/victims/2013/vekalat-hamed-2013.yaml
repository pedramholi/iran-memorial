    News of the execution of Mr. Hamed Vekalat and fifteen other prisoners was
    published by a number of sources including the Prosecutor General of
    Sistan and Baluchistan Province (October 27, 2013,) Fars News Agency
    (October 26, 2013,) Central News Unit (October 26, 2013,) and HRANA
    (December 11, 2013.) Further information on the case was obtained from
    interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with a person
    familiar with Mr. Vekalat (ABF interview,) the letter Mr. Vekalat
    addressed to the United Nation s Human Rights Commissioner from inside
    Zahedan prison (May-June 2013,) transcripts of the audio file Mr. Vekalat
    recorded in prison (Baluch Activists Campaign, January 5, 2012) as well as
    other sources.* Mr. Vekalat was a young, married member of Iran s Baluch
    minority and a native of the village of Kuhban-e Zarabad in the Konarak
    County jurisdiction of Sistan and Baluchistan province. He worked as a
    guard at a dock construction company (ABF interview). Background Following
    an armed attack by Jaish ul-Adl* on a border station in Saravan, Sistan
    and Baluchistan (Friday night, October 25, 2013), as a result of which at
    least 14 border guards were killed and seven injured, the Ministry of
    Justice of the province reported the execution of 16 prisoners on
    Saturday, October 26. The Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Zahedan
    referred to the execution of the 16 villains connected to enemy groups as
    retaliation. According to the Chief Justice of Sistan and Baluchistan, the
    execution of these convicts had been postponed out of Islamic compassion
    but due to Jaish ul-Adl s assault on provincial border guards and
    insistence on cowardly terrorist attacks, the sentences were at last
    carried out (Asr-e Hamoon, Fars News Agency.) The convicts had been
    arrested during the preceding few years and were not connected to Jaish
    ul-Adl s armed attack, which took place only a few hours before their
    execution. They faced various charges across different cases: according to
    provincial judicial authorities, eight of them had been accused of drug
    offenses (Ministry of Justice of Sistan and Baluchistan.) Human rights
    organizations and activists called this mass summary execution a reprisal
    and protested against the execution of the prisoners who were not directly
    connected to the armed attack. Ahmed Shaheed, United Nations Special
    rapporteur on the Human Rights situation in Iran, called the execution of
    these people a type of retaliation in-kind and an illegal act according to
    international human rights laws. Shirin Ebadi, lawyer and Nobel Peace
    Prize Laureate, and Sarah Leah Whitson, Human Rights Watch expert, also
    considered the execution of the 16 prisoners in retaliation for the border
    guards killing as a violation of legal norms and an indicator of the lack
    of independence of Iran s judiciary. Both experts condemned the
    executions. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, human rights
    activists, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued
    statements protesting the reprisal. Arrest and Detention Intelligence
    Ministry Operatives took Mr. Vekalat into custody on June 9, 2010, as he
    was in route to the city of Chabahar from his village. He was taken to the
    Ministry of Intelligence detention facility in Zahedan. Mr. Vekalat wrote
    that he was held in a solitary cell here for three months, after which
    time he was transferred to the incommunicado solitary wing of Zahedan
    Prison where he would be confined for nine months. During his time in the
    solitary cell, Mr. Vekalat was deprived of the right to meet with his
    family and lawyer. He reported being subjected to physical and mental
    torture in the Intelligence facility, referring to beatings with cables,
    electric shock, knockout spray, the miracle bed, and being left alone for
    long periods of time as being among such tortures: Which of these tortures
    could I speak of that you d understand, that you could give form to in
    your mind, that wouldn t make your hair stand on end? For three months in
    the Intelligence facility I was subjected to the worst, most brutal
    tortures Three times they tied me down to the miracle bed. My feet were
    ruined. For two or three months they wouldn t fit in my slippers. I prayed
    sitting down. Besides these physical tortures, Mr. Vekalat also spoke of
    mental and psychological abuses which caused him to forget the name of his
    own child while in solitary: I said I was disgusted with myself, that I d
    tell him anything he wanted, lies or whatever. He said No, not lies the
    truth. They threw me into solitary, forcing me mentally and
    psychologically: for three months I was there all by myself. I said,
    Execution has an upside compared to all this torture you re doing. With
    execution, it s all over in a couple minutes. They said Aren t you afraid
    of execution? I said Execution has an upside: two minutes and a person is
    over and done with. With this stuff you guys are doing to my back and
    feet, my eyes are gonna burst. I ve lost my fear of
