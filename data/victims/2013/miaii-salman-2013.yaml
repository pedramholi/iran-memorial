    News of the execution of Mr. Salman Miaii was reported by a number of
    sources including the Prosecutor General of Sistan Va Baluchestan (October
    27, 2013,) Kurdpa (October 29, 2013,) the Baluch Activists Campaign
    (October 30, 2013,) and HRANA (October 28, 2013.) Further information on
    the case was obtained from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation with a relative of Mr. Miaii (ABF interview) and
    other sources.* Mr. Miaii was a young Baluch and native of Chabahar in
    Iran s Sistan Va Baluchestan province. He was married and the father of
    two young children. He was a seminarian studying hadith in his final year
    at the Sunni Harmin and Sharfin madrasah in Chabahar; apart from these
    scholarly activities he also served as the Imam at a local mosque.
    According to a source close to Mr. Miaii, he was a pious person of calm
    demeanor and held no extremist sectarian views. He was no affiliated with
    any political group (ABF interview.) Background Following an armed attack
    by Jaish ul-Adl* on a border station in Saravan, Sistan Va Baluchestan
    (Friday night, October 25, 2013), as a result of which at least 14 border
    guards were killed and seven injured, the Ministry of Justice of the
    province reported the execution of 16 prisoners on Saturday, October 26.
    The Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Zahedan referred to the
    execution of the 16 villains connected to enemy groups as retaliation.
    According to the Chief Justice of Sistan Va Baluchestan, the execution of
    these convicts had been postponed out of Islamic compassion but due to
    Jaish ul-Adl s assault on provincial border guards and insistence on
    cowardly terrorist attacks, the sentences were at last carried out (Asr-e
    Hamoon, Fars News Agency.) The convicts had been arrested during the
    preceding few years and were not connected to Jaish ul-Adl s armed attack,
    which took place only a few hours before their execution. They faced
    various charges across different cases: according to provincial judicial
    authorities, eight of them had been accused of drug offenses (Ministry of
    Justice of Sistan Va Baluchestan.) Human rights organizations and
    activists called this mass summary execution a reprisal and protested
    against the execution of the prisoners who were not directly connected to
    the armed attack. Ahmed Shaheed, United Nations Special rapporteur on the
    Human Rights situation in Iran, called the execution of these people a
    type of retaliation in-kind and an illegal act according to international
    human rights laws. Shirin Ebadi, lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate,
    and Sarah Leah Whitson, Human Rights Watch expert, also considered the
    execution of the 16 prisoners in retaliation for the border guards killing
    as a violation of legal norms and an indicator of the lack of independence
    of Iran s judiciary. Both experts condemned the executions. Amnesty
    International, Human Rights Watch, human rights activists, and the
    International Federation for Human Rights also issued statements
    protesting the reprisal. Arrest and detention According to comments made
    by a source close to Mr. Miaii, he was taken into custody by agents of the
    Intelligence Ministry while returning home from school in mid-winter 2010
    in the course of mass arrests made following the Taso ah bombings of
    December 15 (ABF interview.) He was freed a week after the initial arrest;
    three days later, however, he was again taken into custody, where he would
    spend four months in solitary confinement in an Intelligence detention
    facility under physical and mental torture. Here he was deprived of the
    right to contact his family and lawyer. After being transferred to Zahedan
    prison he was granted permission for a 20-minute in-person meeting before
    prison officials with his mother, father, and wife (ABF interview.) In
    October-November 2012, following inmate protests against degrading
    treatment from prison staff which ended with the violent intervention of
    the special guard, Mr. Miaii was relocated to Khorramabad prison. Owing to
    the distance and difficulty of travel, it became practically impossible
    for the family to visit their child: their requests to have Mr. Miaii
    transferred a closer facility were denied by authorities in the case
    (Baluch Activists Campaign.) Trial Branch 1 of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Zahedan sentenced Mr. Miaii in a closed session. No precise
    information is available on trial sessions. Charges The court found Mr.
    Miaii guilty of membership and collaboration with the Jundullah
    organization (ABF interview.) A statement from the Sistan Va Baluchestan
    Prosecutor General details the charges brought against Mr. Miaii and seven
    other codefendants as moharebeh ( war against God, ) corruption on earth
    through collaboration with and membership in Jundullah, and effective
    participation in terrorist incidents in the province in recent years
    (October 27, 2013.) The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
