    Information regarding the murder of Mr. Ataollah Rezvani, son of
    Enayatollah, was taken from various sources. His cousin, Mr. Navid Aqdasi,
    sent several emails to the Boroumand Foundation. Several other reports
    were published on the websites of Rooz on August 27, 2013, HRANA on August
    25 and October 17, 2013, Radio Zamaneh on August 25 and October 1, 2013,
    Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse on August 28, Farsi Deutsche Welle on
    August 27, 2013, Darolershad on August 12, 2010, and Baha i International
    Community on August 29, 2013. The Bahai International Community also
    raised the extra-judicial killing of Mr. Rezvani to the 24th Regular
    Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on September 17, 2013.
    According to the information sent to the Boroumand Foundation, Mr. Rezvani
    was born in Birjand on March 19, 1961. After completing elementary and
    high school in his birthplace, he was accepted as a mechanical engineering
    major at Elm-o San at (Science and Technology) University in Tehran in
    1979. However, he was expelled from the university a year later during the
    Cultural Revolution. He then worked in Tehran for four years. Finally, he
    moved to Bandar Abbas to build water treatment units in Minab and Bandar
    Abbas where he resided until his death. He was married with two children.
    Mr. Rezvani s cousin, Mr. Navid Aqdasi, provided ABF with detailed
    information about Mr. Rezvani s case. Mr. Rezvani was an active member of
    the Baha i Community in Bandar Abbas and was popular in this city for his
    assistance to Baha is and non-Baha is. He was once arrested and detained
    for two weeks in 1983 during which he lost hearing in his left ear due to
    slaps he received. In addition to Mr. Rezvani, some other members of his
    family had been arrested and detained for being Baha i at various times.
    For instance his sister, Ms. Sahba Rezvani, was sentenced to three and a
    half years imprisonment in Semnan and Tehran for being a Baha i. In
    addition, officials disrupted Mr. Rezvani s work in Bandar Abbas by
    preventing his participation in contract bids. Many of his colleagues and
    customers were forced to discontinue their business transactions with him
    due to pressure from authorities. The Intelligence officials imposed this
    pressure through various institutions such as Amaken (Places) Office and
    the Security Section of the Department of Water and Wastewater in Bandar-e
    Abbas. According to Mr. Aqdasi, on one occasion, the Intelligence Office
    in Bandar Abbas demanded that the Department of Water and Wastewater not
    purchase their goods from Mr. Rezvani. According to the same source,
    security officials threatened Mr. Rezvani several times including sending
    him a message through other interrogated Baha is as, tell Rezvani that his
    turn will come. According to Radio Zamaneh, during the past few years, the
    Intelligence Office in Bandar Abbas and the Emam Jom eh (Friday Imam)
    threatened Mr. Rezvani several times. Rezvani sent a letter to Ayatollah
    Gholam ali Na imabadi, Bandar Abbas s Friday Imam, requesting that the
    rights of Baha i citizens be respected and asked the Ayatollah not to
    provoke people against Baha is during his Friday sermons. During an
    interview with Rooz, Mr. Rezvani s son referred to the multiple speeches
    of Bandar Abbas s Friday Imam against Baha is and added that his father
    and two other friends wrote a letter to the office of the Friday Imam
    objecting to his speech. Mr. Rezvani and his friends also filed a
    complaint with security and military authorities explaining that such
    speech could cause tension and bloodshed. However, these appeals proved
    fruitless. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
