    of Mojahedin Khalq Organization*. She worked in the personnel section of
    this organization until June 20, 1981. She also collaborated with Mojahed
    Publication and Radio Mojahed. After that she worked on providing

    Khalq Organization of Iran and Women as an Agent of Change) The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization(MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adopted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary,
    and they believed in an armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They
    valued Marxism as a progressive economic and social analysis method but
    considered Islam their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975 following a profound ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology, and after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to the split of the
    Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January 1979, the
    imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with other
    political prisoners. They began re-organizing the MKO and recruiting new
    members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities. Still, its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were vehemently
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.*** Background In 1986, the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran's leadership, members, and supporters
    went to Iraq after they were expelled from France and settled in the
    Ashraf Base. The Ashraf Base was located north of Diala Province, 80
    kilometers (50 miles) from Baghdad. In 1987, the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran established the national liberation army at this
    base, and the Organization's members were trained there. The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization of Iran had several bases in Iraq in the years the
    Organization remained in that country, and from there, they were able to
    attack Iran four times in operations called Aftab (March 28, 1988),
    Chelcheragh (June 18, 1988), Forugh-e Javidan (July 25, 1988), and
