    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Aqazadeh, along with 17 others, was
    published on the website of Mukrian news agency on December 18, 2013. He
    was from Orumieh. Arrest and detention According to the report, Mr.
    Aqazadeh was detained for several years. The circumstances of his arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Aqazadeh s trial. Charges According to the report, the charge brought
    against Mr. Aqazadeh was announced as murder. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Aqazadeh. Defense No information is available on Mr. Aqazadeh s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Hossein Aqazadeh was hanged, along with three others, in the
    Orumieh Central Prison yard on Monday December 16, 2013.
