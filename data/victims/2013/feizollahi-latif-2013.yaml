    News of the execution of Mr. Latif Feizollahi, son of Ahmad Morad, was
    published on the Kurdistan-Kordpa News Agency s website. Additional
    information about this case was obtained through an Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center interview with a person close to Mr. Fezollahi, and from documents
    available at the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, including a brief written
    by Mr. Feizollahi s attorney, the Court Decision, and the Decision of the
    Supreme Court of Iran. Mr. Feizollahi was born in 1965-66 in the town of
    Ravansar s village of Dolatabad in Kermanshah Province. He had a seventh
    grade education, was married and had two children, and was a farmer.
    According to a person close to him, Mr. Feizollahi was a quiet, dignified,
    and religious man. Mr. Feizollahi s case is related to the murder of his
    cousin in a collective family brawl in the Banchian Sofla village in
    1998-99. Arrest and detention On November 30, 1998, following a complaint
    brought by the next of kin, Dolatabad village police officers arrested Mr.
    Feizollahi, his wife, his father, sister, and two of his brothers and took
    them into custody at the police post. The next morning, Mr. Feizollahi was
    transferred to Kermanshah s Diesel Abad Prison. Mr. Feizollahi spent 16
    years and 21 days at Kermanshah s Diesel Abad Prison and was allowed
    weekly in-person visitations with his family. Trial The Town of Ravansar
    General Court, Branch One, was the first court to try Mr. Feizollahi.
    Following an appeal of the court s decision by Mr. Feizollahi s attorney,
    Supreme Court Branch Seven remanded the case to the Town of Javanrud
    General Court, Branch Two. Javanrud Court s decision was upheld by Supreme
    Court Branch 16, and upon the Head of the Judiciary s opposition to the
    implementation of the ruling, Supreme Court Branch 40 examined the case
    once again and upheld Supreme Court Branch 16 s decision. Upon a request
    for a de novo trial submitted by three of the Supreme Court judges
    considering the case and the approval of the Head of the Judiciary, the
    case was ultimately remanded by Supreme Court Branch 20 to the Town of
    Ravansar Criminal Court, Branch 101. (Documents available at the Boroumand
    Center). According to available information, Mr. Feizollahi s attorney
    accompanied him in the court sessions. (Boroumand Center interview).
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Feizollahi was being the principal
    in intentional murder . During a collective scuffle between several
    members of Mr. Feizollahi s family, using shovels, pickaxes, and stones,
    Mr. Feizollahi s cousin sustained injuries to the neck and the spinal cord
    and died five days later, on November 29, 1998, at Kermanshah s Taleqani
    Hospital. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The Police report naming Mr. Feizollahi as
    the perpetrator of the injuries, a complaint brought by the injured person
    while undergoing medical treatment at the hospital along with the next of
    kin s complaint, the Medical Examiner s report, and Mr. Feizollahi s own
    statements and admissions were among the evidence presented against him at
    trial. (Documents available at the Boroumand Center). International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    Although Mr. Feizollahi made admissions and confessions in the preliminary
    investigations stage, he later denied his confessions at trial and stated
    that they were made under threats and duress. He stated that he had
    accepted the charge of murder so that his wife and sister who had been
    arrested at the same time he was, could be released. Mr. Feizollahi stated
    that his father had been the one who had struck the victim, and even
    though his father accepted the charge of murder at trial, the court did
    not accept Mr. Feizollahi s denial and his father s confession. The
    Javanrud General Court, Branch Two judge cited Mr. Feizollahi s father s
    physical frailty and advanced age as the only reason for dismissing his
    confession, and conducted no other examination and/or investigations in
    this regard. (Interview and Documents available at the Boroumand Center).
    According to available information, no witness in court confirmed Mr.
    Feizollahi striking the victim. The fact that this case was tried in three
    separate trial courts and was examined by four separate Supreme Court
    Branches in a span of over 16 years is indicative of the lack of
    sufficient evidence against Mr. Feizollahi, as well as doubt by, and lack
    of agreement among, the judges of various courts in attributing the
    charges to him. Judgment On February 18, 2010, the Town of Ravansar
    Criminal Court, Branch 101, sentenced Mr. Feizollahi to Qesas of life (the
    death penalty as retribution) on
