    News of the execution of Ayub ( Ahmad ) Bahramzehi was published by a
    number of sources, including the Sistan Va Baluchestan Judiciary (October
    27, 2013,) The Baluch Activists Campaign (March 15, 2014,) and Human
    Rights Activists for Democracy in Iran (October 30, 2013.) Additional
    information on the case was obtained from an interview conducted by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with a source close to Mr. Bahramzehi
    (ABF interview,) a Baluch Activists Campaign interview with a relative of
    Mr. Bahramzehi (October 26, 2015,) and other sources.* Mr. Bahramzehi, son
    of Golmohammad, was a young Baluch bachelor and native of the village of
    Nasirabad, Sarbaz county in Iran s Sistan Va Baluchestan province (ABF
    interview, Baluch Activists interview.) He had obtained a high school
    diploma with a concentration in literature and was engaged in religious
    studies at the Kuhvan Religious School. According to his family, he was an
    ordinary young man who was not politically active or involved with any
    party or group (ABF interview.) Bahramzehi was first arrested in June 2008
    in the course of clashes between Nasirabad residents and security forces
    intent on entering residents houses without a warrant. He spent a year in
    the Intelligence Office detention facility in Zahedan and Zahedan Central
    Prison before being released on bail (Baluch Activists, October 26, 2015.
    Background Following an armed attack by Jaish ul-Adl* on a border station
    in Saravan, Sistan and Baluchistan (Friday night, October 25, 2013), as a
    result of which at least 14 border guards were killed and seven injured,
    the Ministry of Justice of the province reported the execution of 16
    prisoners on Saturday, October 26. The Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor
    of Zahedan referred to the execution of the 16 villains connected to enemy
    groups as retaliation. According to the Chief Justice of Sistan and
    Baluchistan, the execution of these convicts had been postponed out of
    Islamic compassion but due to Jaish ul-Adl s assault on provincial border
    guards and insistence on cowardly terrorist attacks, the sentences were at
    last carried out (Asr-e Hamoon, Fars News Agency.) The convicts had been
    arrested during the preceding few years and were not connected to Jaish
    ul-Adl s armed attack, which took place only a few hours before their
    execution. They faced various charges across different cases: according to
    provincial judicial authorities, eight of them had been accused of drug
    offenses (Ministry of Justice of Sistan and Baluchistan.) Human rights
    organizations and activists called this mass summary execution a reprisal
    and protested against the execution of the prisoners who were not directly
    connected to the armed attack. Ahmed Shaheed, United Nations Special
    rapporteur on the Human Rights situation in Iran, called the execution of
    these people a type of retaliation in-kind and an illegal act according to
    international human rights laws. Shirin Ebadi, lawyer and Nobel Peace
    Prize Laureate, and Sarah Leah Whitson, Human Rights Watch expert, also
    considered the execution of the 16 prisoners in retaliation for the border
    guards killing as a violation of legal norms and an indicator of the lack
    of independence of Iran s judiciary. Both experts condemned the
    executions. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, human rights
    activists, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued
    statements protesting the reprisal. Arrest and Detention According to
    comments made by a source close to Mr. Bahramzehi, agents of the
    Intelligence Ministry took him into custody on April 19, 2010. Mr.
    Bahramzehi was subject to beatings during the arrest, and a friend of his
    was fatally shot by security operatives (Baluch Activists.) Mr. Bahramzehi
    spent nine months in solitary confinement at the Intelligence Ministry
    facility in Zahedan before being transferred to Zahedan Central Prison
    (ABF interview.) During his time at the Ministry detention center he was
    denied rights to contact with his family and access to a lawyer and was
    subjected to physical and psychological torture. Later on, in general
    population at Zahedan Central, he turned his attention to Qoranic studies
    and assisting other prisoners; after some time he managed to memorize the
    Qoran in its entirety (ABF interview.) Trial No information is available
    regarding the details of Mr. Bahramzehi s trial. Charges According to
    comments made by a source close to Mr. Bahramzehi, the charges brought
    against him comprised resisting security agents, incitement against
    intelligence agents, collaboration with Jundullah, and meeting with
    criminals on Pakistani soil (Baluch Activists, October 26, 2015.) A
    statement from the Sistan Va Baluchestan Judiciary details the charges
    brought against Mr. Bahramzehi and seven other codefendants as moharebeh (
    war against God, ) corruption on earth through collaboration with and
    membership in Jundullah, and effective participation in terrorist
    incidents in the province in recent years (
