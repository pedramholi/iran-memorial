    Kurdistan (The Free Life Party of Kurdistan) is a leftist organization
    established in January of 2004 with the goal of creating a democratic,
    ecologic, and gender equal society in a democratic and federal Iran with
    self-determination for ethnic minorities. Its first congress took place on
    April 25, 2004. This party, headed by Abdollrahman Hajiahmadi, has a close
    connection with the PKK in Turkey and considers the PKK leader, Abdollah
    Ojalan (Apu), as its inspirational leader. PJAK has influence mostly in
    the northern Kurdistan region of Iran and fights the Islamic Republic
    militarily. PJAK refers to Kurdistan of Iran as Eastern Kurdistan.
