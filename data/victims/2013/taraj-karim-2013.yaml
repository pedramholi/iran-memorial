    News of the execution of Mr. Karim Taraj, along with seven others of whom
    only three names are known, was published on the website of the Human
    Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran on July 4, 2013. Additionally, news
    of the execution of 25 individuals with only four names was published on
    the websites of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) and the Iran
    Human Rights Organization on July 3, 2013. According to these reports, 4
    individuals were from the Gohardasht Prison and the other 21 from the
    Qezelhesar Prison. The official media in Iran did not report these
    executions. Mr. Taraj, 32, was from Ilam. His brother was killed during an
    armed clash with the governor of Ilam. According to the Human Rights and
    Democracy Activists in Iran, this caused the execution of Mr. Taraj to be
    expedited. Arrest and detention According to the existing information, Mr.
    Taraj was detained for four years in Section 3 of the Raja ishahr Prison
    in Karaj (HRANA). The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Taraj s trial. Charges
    According to the Iran Human Rights Organization, the charge brought
    against Mr. Taraj was announced as murder. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Taraj. Defense No information is available on Mr. Taraj s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Karim Taraj was hanged, along with three others, in the
    Gohardasht (Raja ishahr) Prison yard on July 3, 2013 in the morning.
