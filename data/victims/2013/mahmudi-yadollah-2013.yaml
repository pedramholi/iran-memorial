    News of the execution of Mr. Yadollah Mahmudi, along with ten others of
    whom four were unknown and two were female, was published on the website
    of Mukrian news agency on October 30, 2013 and on the website of HRANA
    (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on November 4, 2013. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Mahmudi s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Mahmudi s trial. Charges
    According to the Mukrian news agency, the charge brought against Mr.
    Mahmudi was announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Mahmudi. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mahmudi s defense. Judgment Mr. Yadollah Mahmudi was
    hanged, along with six others, in the Orumieh Central Prison on Wednesday
    October 30, 2013.
