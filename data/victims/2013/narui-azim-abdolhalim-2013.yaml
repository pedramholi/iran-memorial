    General Office of Public Relations in Mehr News Agency (September 1, and
    5, 2013); and Radio Farda (September 21, 2013). Additional information
    about this case was obtained from the Washington Times English language
    News Agency (September 1, 2013); Khabar Network (September 4, 2013); Fars
    News Agency (September 7, 2013); Defa Moqaddass ( Sacred Defense ) News

    (December 17, 2013); and Council to Human Rights Association for Migrants
    Rights for Migrants (Perseus) report (October 30, 2013). According to
    information published on the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran's
    websites, Mr. Naru'i was born in Zabol. He was 58 and had a high school
    diploma. He was accepted to the Shir-o-Khorshid Medical College in Tehran.
    Despite finishing the fourth year of medical school, he had to return to
    his hometown, Zahedan, after the cultural revolution and the closure of
    universities following the Islamic revolution. He was hired at the Public
    Health Office of Zahedan and began working at BooAli Hospital. At that
    time, he sympathized with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran and
    cooperated with the Organization in distributing publications and
    collecting funds for them. "In 1981, with the emergence of the nationwide
    revolutionary resistance," Mr. Naru'i" was engaged in responding to the
    Organization's needs in that region. When the location he had used for
    partisan activities was exposed, he inevitably turned to a secret life.
    Sometime later, in September 1981, he and his comrades left the country
    through the eastern borders and were sent to Pakistan. Since 1981, they
    have devoted themselves entirely to the goals of the Organization they
    loved." He retained various responsibilities in Pakistan until 1987, then
    moved to Iraq and continued cooperation with the Organization's Liberation
    Army. At the time [it was decided that] the Ashraf Base* would be
    evacuated in 2013, so that Mojahedin Khalq members could be transferred to
    Camp Liberty** which was under the protection of the United States 100 (or
    101) of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran members remained at
    Ashraf Base, among whom was Mr. Naru i. According to the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran, he and 99 of his cohorts, none of whom were armed ,
    were in charge of selling the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran s
    assets at the Ashraf Base. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization(MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adopted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in an armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    economic and social analysis method but considered Islam their source of
    inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened
    when many members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975 following a
    profound ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology, and after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to the split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977.
    In January 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began re-organizing the MKO and
    recruiting new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities. Still, its
    efforts to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were
    vehemently opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.*** Background In 1986,
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran's leadership, members, and
    supporters went to Iraq after they were expelled from France and settled
    in the Ashraf Base. The Ashraf Base was located north of Diala Province,
    80 kilometers (50 miles) from Baghdad. In 1987, the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran established the national liberation army at this
    base, and the Organization's members were trained there. The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization of Iran had several
