    News of the execution of an unknown individual was published by various
    sources including the Iranelect website (September 22, 2013) and Tabnak
    (September 25, 2013.) This defendant was from Kazerun, Fars, and only 14
    years old when the crime took place. International laws have strictly
    prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18
    at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil
    and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran
    has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed
    before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. The defendant was detained
    for four years (from the age of 14 to 18.) Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charge brought against
    this unknown individual was announced as murder. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against the defendant. Defense The unknown individual
    was under 18 years old when the incident occurred. No information is
    available on the defendant s defense. Judgment The court in which the case

    2013. No specific information is available about the defendant s
    execution.
