    General Office of Public Relations in Mehr News Agency (September 1, and
    5, 2013); and Radio Farda (September 21, 2013). Additional information
    about this case was obtained from the Washington Times English language

    News Agency (September 7, 2013); Defa Moqaddass ( Sacred Defense ) News

    (December 17, 2013); and Council to Human Rights Association for Migrants
    Rights for Migrants (Perseus) report (October 30, 2013). According to
    available information, Ms. Hosseini was 49 years old. She was born in
    Tehran, and she had a high school diploma. According to her comrades, She
    became familiar with political ideas in her childhood. She was very smart,
    and she was an honor student in Tehran schools. She was kind and
    compassionate and she always tried to help people in need. They add, One
    of Maryam s outstanding qualities was that she accepted every
    responsibility whole heartedly and she carried it through. This is how she
    was able to accept different responsibilities with high spirits and a
    can-do attitude. She was able to accomplish her goals with the least
    amount of materials, around the clock effort, in record time, and to the
    best of her ability. Ms. Hosseini joined the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    through her brother, in 1979, when she was 15. Her activities in this
    organization included selling journals and books. On June 13, 1981, she
    was arrested during a peaceful street demonstration. She suffered 4 years
    in Qezel Hesar and Evin Prisons, and she was released in 1985. She left
    Iran in 1988 and joined the Mojahedin in Ashraf Base in Iraq. Background
    In 1986, the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran s leadership, members,
    and supporters went to Iraq after they were expelled from France, and
    settled in the Ashraf Base. The Ashraf Base was located in the north of
    Diala Province, 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Baghdad. In 1987, the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran established the national liberation
    army at this base, and the Organization s members were trained there. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran had several bases in Iraq in the
    years the Organization remained in that country, and from there, they were
    able to attack Iran four times in operations called Aftab (March 28,
    1988), Chelcheragh (June 18, 1988), Forugh-e Javidan (July 25, 1988), and
    Morvarid (March 9, 1991). In the three decades the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran was in Iraq, the Ashraf Base was repeatedly the
    subject of missile, air, and ground attacks by the Iranian regime, which
    resulted in the killing and wounding of Mojahedin Khalq members. The base
    was also bombed several times during the United States war with Iraq in
    2003, inflicting casualties as well as property and financial damage.
    After the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) attack on Iraq,
    and the disarming of the Mojahedin members, the residents of the Ashraf
    Base came under the protection of U.S. forces. A number of intelligence
    services, including the FBI, went to the Ashraf Base on behalf of the
    United States government and conducted one on one interviews with every
    single member of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran. All of the
    Mojahedin Khalq members backgrounds and records of activities were
    investigated in the course of these interviews. Once the investigations
    were over, it became clear that Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran
    members had not violated any laws, and had also remained impartial during
    the war. Therefore, in 2004, the multinational forces led by the United
    States, recognized all of ashraf s residents as protected persons under
    the Fourth Geneva Convention. With the gradual withdrawal of the U.S.
    forces from Iraqi cities in the summer of 2009, the United States
    relinquished protection of Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran members to
    Iraq. The settlement of Iraqi armed forces around the base was accompanied
    by clashes and bloodshed. After Iraqi authorities announced several times
    their intention to take Ashraf Base and evict its residents, Iraqi forces
    attacked the base on July 28, and 29, 2009, using bulldozers, tear gas,
    water cannons, and clubs. According to available information, Mojahedin
    Khalq members formed a human chain in front of the attackers and tried to
    prevent them from entering the base. In the course of this attack, which
    resulted in the installation of a police post inside the base
