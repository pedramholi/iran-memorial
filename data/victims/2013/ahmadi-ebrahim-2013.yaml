    Provincial Criminal Court of Tehran tried Mr. Ahamadi. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges According to the existing information, the
    charge brought against Mr. Ahmadi was announced as murder. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    The evidence presented against Mr. Ahmadi was testimonies of witnesses who
    were present at the crime scene, and his confession. Testimonies of
    witnesses to the murder and drawing the defendant s portrait, confessions
    of the defendant during interrogations, an injury on the defendant s hand
    and his visit to the nearby clinic for treatment, and 36 marks of a knife
    on the victim s body were all considered evidence against Mr. Ahmadi.
    (Hamshahri Online and the E temad newspaper) International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Ahmadi s defense. He expressed regret for the murder
    and stated that he never intended to kill the victim. He owed the victim
    money and could not pay him back due to his financial problems, and he had
    been under psychological pressure. According to Mr. Ahmadi, he had met the
    victim to discuss his debt when their argument escalated in the victim s
    car and he committed the murder when he was very angry and had no control
    over his actions. (E temad newspaper) Judgment The Provincial Criminal
    Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Ebrahim Ahmadi to death. The Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was transferred to solitary confinement in
    Section 5 of the Gohardasht Prison on January 15, 2013 and was hanged in
    the Gohardasht Prison in Karaj on January 16, 2013 at dawn.
