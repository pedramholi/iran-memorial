    Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Ahmad Bustani was
    published on the website of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran
    (March 27, September 14, September 18, and 23, 2013, and September 7,
    2017); Beh Guneh website (September 3, 2013); National Council of
    Resistance Women s Commission (September 1, 2017); Women [are] a Force for
    Change (September 1, 2017), quoting the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
    General Office of Public Relations in Mehr News Agency (September 1, and
    5, 2013); and Radio Farda (September 21, 2013). Additional information
    about this case was obtained from the Washington Times English language
    News Agency (September 1, 2013); Khabar Network (September 4, 2013); Fars
    News Agency (September 7, 2013); Defa Moqaddass ( Sacred Defense ) News
    Agency (July 28, 2014); Jamaran website (October 5, 2021); Human Rights
    Watch (July 31, 2009, and April 15, 2011); Foreign Policy magazine
    (December 17, 2013); and Council to Human Rights Association for Migrants
    Rights for Migrants (Perseus) report (October 30, 2013). According to
    information published on the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran
    websites, Mr. Boostani, 62, was born in Shiraz. He entered Sharif
    (Aryamehr) University of Technology in Tehran in 1969. He studied
    Electrical Engineering. In 1972, he was arrested for political activities
    at the university and spent two months in prison. He was hired as an
    electrical engineer at the National Customs electrical engineering
    section. He was in direct contact with the Mojahedin Organization starting
    in 1978. Mr. Boostani started to work in the Workers Section of the
    Mojahedin Organization, and he was one of the producers of the workers
    publication Bazooye Enghelab (Arm of the Revolution). When the
    Revolutionary Guards of the Islamic Republic attacked several bases of the
    Mojahedin Organization on August 1, 1982, Mr. Boostani escaped these
    attacks and was subsequently sent out of the country. In Iraq, at Camp
    Ashraf, he was engaged in facilities engineering, technical support, and
    procurement. He was also a member of the National Council of Resistance.
    Background In 1986, the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran's leadership,
    members, and supporters went to Iraq after they were expelled from France
    and settled in the Ashraf Base. The Ashraf Base was located north of Diala
    Province, 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Baghdad. In 1987, the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization of Iran established the national liberation army at
    this base, and the Organization's members were trained there. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran had several bases in Iraq in the
    years the Organization remained in that country, and from there, they were
    able to attack Iran four times in operations called Aftab (March 28,
    1988), Chelcheragh (June 18, 1988), Forugh-e Javidan (July 25, 1988), and
    Morvarid (March 9, 1991). In the three decades the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran was in Iraq, the Ashraf Base was repeatedly the
    subject of missile, air, and ground attacks by the Iranian regime, which
    resulted in the killing and wounding of Mojahedin Khalq members. The base
    was also bombed several times during the United States' war with Iraq in
    2003, inflicting casualties, property, and financial damage. After the
    International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) attack on Iraq and the
    disarming of the Mojahedin members, the residents of the Ashraf Base came
    under the protection of U.S. forces. Several intelligence services,
    including the FBI, went to the Ashraf Base on behalf of the United States
    government and conducted one-on-one interviews with every member of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran. The Mojahedin Khalq members'
    backgrounds and activity records were investigated during these
    interviews. Once the investigations were over, it became clear that
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran members had not violated any laws and
    remained impartial during the war. Therefore, in 2004, the multinational
    forces led by the United States recognized Ashraf's residents as protected
    persons under the Fourth Geneva Convention. With the gradual withdrawal of
    the U.S. forces from Iraqi cities in the summer of 2009, the United States
    relinquished the protection of Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran
    members to Iraq. The settlement of Iraqi armed forces around the base was
    accompanied by clashes and bloodshed. After Iraqi authorities repeatedly
    announced their intention to take Ashraf Base and evict its residents,
    Iraqi forces attacked the base on July 28, 29, 2009, using bulldozers,
    tear gas, water cannons, and clubs. According to available information,
    Mojahedin Khalq members formed a human chain before the attackers and
    tried to prevent them from entering the base. During this attack, which
    resulted in installing a police post inside the base, at least seven
    Mojahedin members were killed, and many were wounded and arrested.
