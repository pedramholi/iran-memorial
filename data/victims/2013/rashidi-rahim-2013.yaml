    News of the execution of Mr. Rahim Rashidi, son of Jafar, was obtained
    from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with a
    person close to him (September 10, 2017). Additional information about the
    execution of Mr. Rashidi and two other individuals was obtained from
    Kordpa and Forat News Agencies (October 30, 2013). Mr. Rashidi was married
    and had three sons and two daughters. He was an ethnic Kurd, adherent of
    the Sunni branch of Islam, and was from the village of Jatar in Suma-ye
    Beradust District, located in Orumieh County in West Azarbaijan Province.
    He was a clergyman and was the Prayer Imam in the village of Qolanji. From
    1979 to 1983-84, Mr. Rashidi was a member of the secret organization of
    the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan. According to available
    information, Mr. Rashidi was arrested in 1993 for drug trafficking and was
    pardoned and released from jail after spending 11 years in Orumieh and
    Bandar Abbas prisons. My uncle was a very patriotic man. He was zealously
    proud of being a Kurd [and of his Kurdish heritage]. He tried to bring up
    the subject of and talk about Kurdish rights and the Kurds right to
    self-determination in every village or gathering he went to. He had even
    been warned a couple of times not to get involved in politics and to just
    do his job as a cleric and not talk to people about political matters and
    not try to bring them toward you and your positions]. (Boroumand Center
    Interview with Mr. Rashidi s nephew). Mr. Rashidi s case is related to
    drug-related crimes in 2009 in the city of Shiraz. Arrest and detention I
    early 2010, the Police stopped Mr. Rashidi s car at a stop and search post
    on the Shiraz-Tehran highway, and arrested him after searching his car.
    (Boroumand Center Interview). Mr. Rashidi was taken to the Information
    Administration detention center in the city of Shiraz. After a while,
    security agents transferred him to Shiraz Central Prison. He was
    incarcerated for four years at the Shiraz Central Prison. Because his
    family lived far away, Mr. Rashidi could only have in-person visitations
    his family once a month. His family hired an attorney for him after his
    arrest and he had the opportunity to have access to and meet with his
    attorney. (Boroumand Center Interview with Mr. Rashidi s nephew). Trial
    Mr. Rashidi s trial convened in mid-October 2013, but there are no details
    available regarding the details of the trial session(s). Charges The
    charges brought against Mr. Rashidi were possession and transportation of
    narcotic drugs . According to available information, Mr. Rashidi was owed
    money by a person in Shiraz and had gone there in order to get his money
    back. After paying his debt, the debtor concealed four or five kilos of
    Morphine in Mr. Rashidi s car without his knowledge, and then informed the
    police. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Rashidi was stated as discovery of four or five kilograms of
    the narcotic Morphine in his car, and his prior criminal record . Defense
    According to Mr. Rashidi s nephew, he had no knowledge of the drugs having
    been concealed in his car. In order to confirm his lack of knowledge, he
    asked the court to conduct a fingerprint test but the court did not grant
    the request. The judge had also told Mr. Rashidi at trial that he would
    get a reduced sentence if he changed his religion from Sunni Islam to
    Shiite Islam. Mr. Rashidi did not accept that offer. No further
    information is available regarding Mr. Rashidi s other defenses. Judgment
    On October 30, 2013, Mr. Rahim Rashidi and two other individuals were
    hanged at Shiraz Adelabad Prison. In his last days in prison, Mr. Rashidi
    was in a dire mental state, [partially] due to the fact that they had
    changed the date of his hanging several times. He did not recognize his
    family members and laughed for no reason. The authorities informed Mr.
    Moradi s family of his execution in the afternoon of the day of the
    hanging so they could turn his body over to them. Mr. Rashidi s family
    buried him in the village of Jatar. A large crowd had shown up for Mr.
    Rashidi s burial. The Revolutionary
