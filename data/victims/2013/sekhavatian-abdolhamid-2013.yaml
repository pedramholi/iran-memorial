    News of the execution of Mr. Abdolhamid Sekhavatian, known as Mehdi, was
    published on the websites of Fars Provincial Courthouse, IRNA (Islamic
    Republic News Agency), and the Central News Unit on August 21, 2013. Mr.
    Sekhavatian s case was related to the kidnapping and murder of an
    individual, in collaboration with two others, near Jahrom in 2000. (IRNA)
    Arrest and detention According to the Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of
    Jahrom, Mr. Sekhavatian was arrested by Jahrom police several months after
    the murder incident in 2000. He was able to escape the prison after a
    while and was on the run for three years before being arrested again.
    (IRNA) The circumstances of his arrests and detention are not known.
    According to the Central News Unit report, Mr. Sekhavatian was 28 years
    old when executed. If this information is accurate, he had been 15 years
    old when arrested. International laws have strictly prohibited capital
    punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Trial Branch 102 of the Criminal Court of Jahrom tried
    Mr. Sekhavatian and his two collaborators. No information is available on
    his trial. Charges According to the Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of
    Jahrom, the charge brought against Mr. Sekhavatian was announced as
    murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Sekhavatian was his confession and the confession of his collaborators,
    being identified by a witness, and recovery of the crime evidence.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Sekhavatian s
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Abdolhamid Sekhavatian to death.
    Branch 37 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling, and the Head of
    judiciary approved the public execution. He was hanged in public at Shahid
    Chamron Square in Jahrom on August 21, 2013. According to the Fars
    Provincial Courthouse, another defendant of this case was condemned to 10
    years imprisonment and 50 lashes for participation in murder, to an
    additional 15 years imprisonment for participation in kidnapping, to six
    months imprisonment and 50 lashes for robbery with harassment, and to
    another six months imprisonment for hiding the victim s body.
