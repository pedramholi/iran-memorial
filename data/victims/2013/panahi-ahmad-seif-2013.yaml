    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad Seifpanahi, son of Ali, was published
    on the website of Kurdpa, Kurdistan Press Agency, on November 7, 2013. He
    was a single Kurd residing at Pardis Town in Sanandaj. According to the
    existing information, Mr. Seifpanahi s case was related to the killing of
    a citizen during a street fight in Sanandaj in 2005. He was only 16 years
    old at the time. International laws have strictly prohibited capital
    punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr. Seifpanahi was detained for
    eight years. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Seifpanahi s trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Seifpanahi was murder. He was charged with
    killing a citizen with blows of a knife at Pardis Town in Sanandaj during
    a street fight. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Seifpanahi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Seifpanahi s
    defense. However, he was only 16 years old at the time of committing the
    crime. A Summary of the Defects of Mr. Ahmad Seifpanahi s Legal
    Proceedings According to certain reports, Ahmad Seifpanahi was 16 years
    old at the time of the murder. Although the age of criminal responsibility
    in Iranian law is the age where an individual reaches puberty, and Mr.
    Seifpanahi had reached puberty at the time of the murder, the change in
    the Islamic Penal Code in 2013, provides individuals under the age of 18
    with the possibility of being exempt from the death penalty. Pursuant to
    Article 91 of said Law, In crimes requiring Hadd or Qesas, if the
    individuals under the age of 18 who have attained puberty cannot
    comprehend the nature of the crime or the prohibition thereof, or if there
    is doubt as to their mental development [and capacity] and maturity, they
    will be sentenced to the punishments prescribed in this chapter on a case
    by case basis. In order to ascertain mental development and maturity, the
    court may obtain the medical examiner s opinion, or utilize any other
    method it deems appropriate. Although the murder occurred prior to the
    passage of said Law, the Law does, however, apply retroactively, and
    covers final judgments issued prior to the passage of the Law. According
    to a Supreme Court General Council Uniform Procedure Decision, Whereas
    Article 10(b) of the Islamic Penal Code of April 21, 2013, provides for
    exemption from crimes requiring Hadd and Qesas punishments in said Article
    s opening provision, and whereas the powers prescribed for the sentence
    implementation judge in amending a sentence and/or the convicted
    individual s right to ask the court for a reduced sentence as provided for
    in said paragraph is not in conflict with the Law on General and
    Revolutionary Courts Rules of Criminal Procedure Article 272, Paragraph 7,
    and does not nullify the same, therefore, in the event that individuals
    sentenced to Qesas, who were under the age of 18 at the time of the
    commission of the crime, and the final sentences in their cases were
    issued prior to the Islamic Penal Code of April 21, 2013, coming into
    force, claim the applicability of Article 91, since the modification and
    reduction of the sentence as provided for in said article ultimately
    constitutes a reduced sentence and a more favorable punishment, they may
    ask for de novo adjudication pursuant to Article 272(7) of the
    aforementioned Rules of Procedure... (Uniform Procedure Decision number
    737, December 2, 2014, Supreme Court General Council). In the present
    case, it appears that judicial authorities did not believe that Amad
    Seifpanahi was not mentally developed and mature at the time of the
    murder. Generally speaking, however, a 16-year-old individual can hardly
    understand the nature of his/her actions as would an adult. There is no
    unified procedure in Iranian courts to ascertain a person s mental
    development and maturity. What courts generally take into account is the
    defendant s conduct at the time of the murder and thereafter. Lack of a
    unified procedure, and not making proper use of specialized medical and
    psychological capabilities, has resulted in certain defendants under the
    age of 18 being found as lacking mental development and maturity in
    certain cases, and as mentally developed and mature in other similar
    cases, and therefore subject to the death penalty. It therefore appears
    that Article 91 is not applied to certain juvenile offenders in a
    methodical and well thought out manner. Furthermore, pursuant to Article
    37 of the Convention on the Ri
