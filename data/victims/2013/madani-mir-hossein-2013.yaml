    about this case was obtained from the Washington Times English language

    News Agency (September 7, 2013); Defa Moqaddass ( Sacred Defense ) News

    Rights for Migrants (Perseus) report (October 30, 2013). According to
    information published on the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran
    websites, Mr. Madani was born in Malayer. He was 53 and had a high school
    diploma. He was born in a fairly well-to-do family. In his early youth,
    when he was 16, he went to the United States to continue his education. He
    was studying electrical engineering at Virginia State University. He
    dropped out because of the Islamic revolution of 1978 and the clashes
    between the Mojahedin and the Islamic regime. He participated full-time
    with the association of university students sympathetic to the Mojahedin
    Organization. In 1986, he went to the border regions and participated in
    Aftab, Chelcheragh, and Forough Javidan Operations against Iran. He was
    one of the people responsible for public relations at Camp Ashraf* and a
    member of the National Council of Resistance. At the time [it was decided
    that] the Ashraf Base would be evacuated in 2013, so that Mojahedin Khalq
    members could be transferred to Camp Liberty** which was under the
    protection of the United States 100 (or 101) of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran members remained at Ashraf Base, among whom was Mr.
    kermanian. According to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran, he and
    99 of his cohorts, none of whom were armed , were in charge of selling the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran s assets at the Ashraf Base. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization(MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adopted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary, and they believed in an armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive economic and social analysis
    method but considered Islam their source of inspiration, culture, and
    ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many members were
    imprisoned and executed. In 1975 following a profound ideological crisis,
    the organization refuted Islam as its ideology, and after a few of its
    members were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization
    proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to the split of the
    Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January 1979, the
    imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with other
    political prisoners. They began re-organizing the MKO and recruiting new
    members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities. Still, its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were vehemently
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.*** Background In 1986, the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran's leadership, members, and supporters
    went to Iraq after they were expelled from France and settled in the
    Ashraf Base. The Ashraf Base was located north of Diala Province, 80
    kilometers (50 miles) from Baghdad. In 1987, the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran established the national liberation army at this
    base, and the Organization's members were trained there. The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization of Iran had several bases in Iraq in the years the
    Organization remained in that country, and from there, they were able to
    attack Iran four times in operations called Aftab (March 28, 1988),
    Chelcheragh (June 18, 1988), Forugh-e Javidan (July 25, 1988), and
    Morvarid (March 9, 1991). In the three decades the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran was in Iraq, the Ashraf Base was repeatedly the
    subject of missile, air, and ground attacks by the Iranian regime, which
    resulted in the killin
