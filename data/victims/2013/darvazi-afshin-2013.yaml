    News of the execution of Mr. Afshin Darvazi, son of Sadeq, was published
    on the website of Kurdpa (Kurdistan Press Agency) on December 7, 2013. He
    was a Kurdish young man from the Gangchin Village near Orumieh. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Darvazi was arrested in 2010. The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Darvazi s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Darvazi was
    announced as dealing narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Darvazi. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Darvazi s defense. Judgment Mr. Afshin
    Darvazi was hanged at Bam Central Prison on December 7, 2013 at dawn. No
    specific information is available about this execution. According to
    Kurdpa, on the day before his execution, his family and the representative
    of Orumieh in parliament had gone to the Supreme Court to stop his
    execution.
