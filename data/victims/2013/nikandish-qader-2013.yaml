    News of the execution of Mr. Qader Nikandish, along with 17 others, was
    published on the website of Mukrian news agency on December 18, 2013 and,
    along with two others, on the website of Kurdpa News Agency on December
    19, 2013. According to Kurdpa, he was a Kurd from the Gugjelu village near
    Miandoab and according to Mukrian, he was from Shahindej. Arrest and
    detention According to the Mukrian news agency, Mr. Nikandish was detained
    for several years. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Nikandish s trial. Charges
    According to reports, the charge brought against Mr. Nikandish was
    announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Nikandish. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Nikandish s defense. Judgment Mr. Qader Nikandish was
    hanged, along with three others, in the Orumieh Central Prison yard on
    Monday December 16, 2013.
