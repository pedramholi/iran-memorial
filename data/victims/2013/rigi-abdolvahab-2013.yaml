    News of the execution of Mr. Abdolvahab Rigi and 15 other people was
    reported by several sources including the Ministry of Justice of Sistan
    and Baluchistan Province (October 27, 2013), Fars News Agency (October 26,
    2013), Central News Agency (October 26, 2013), and HRANA (December 11,
    2013). Additional information was obtained from an interview conducted by
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with one of Mr. Rigi s relatives (ABF
    interview), and Mr. Rigi s letter from Zahedan prison (June, 2013), and
    other resources*. Mr. Rigi was a young, unmarried Baluch living in
    Zahedan. He was a religious person and a student at the Zahedan Darul
    Uloom Seminary (Makki) (ABF interview). Background Following the armed
    attack by Jaish ul-Adl* on a border station in Sarvan, Sistan and
    Baluchistan (Friday night, October 25, 2013), as a result of which at
    least 14 border guards were killed and seven injured, the Ministry of
    Justice of the province reported the execution of 16 prisoners on
    Saturday, October 26. The Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Zahedan
    referred to the execution of the 16 villains connected to enemy groups as
    retaliation . According to the Chief Justice of Sistan and Baluchistan,
    the execution of these convicts had been postponed due to Islamic
    compassion but due to Jaish ul-Adl s assault on provincial border guards
    and continued cowardly terrorist attacks , the sentences were at last
    carried out (Asrehamoon, Fars News Agency). The convicts had been arrested
    during the few preceding years and were not connected to Jaish ul-Adl s
    armed attack, which took place only a few hours before their execution.
    They faced various charges across different cases: according to provincial
    judicial authorities, eight of them had been accused of drug dealing
    (Ministry of Justice of Sistan and Baluchistan). Human rights
    organizations and activists called this mass summary execution a reprisal
    and protested against the execution of the prisoners who were not directly
    connected to the armed attack. Ahmad Shahid, United Nations Special
    rapporteur on the Human Rights situation in Iran, called the execution of
    these people a kind of retaliation in-kind and an illegal act according to
    international human rights laws. Shirin Ebadi, lawyer and Nobel Peace
    Prize Laureate, and Sarah Leah Whitson, Human Rights Watch expert, also
    considered the execution of the 16 prisoners in retaliation for border
    guards killing as a violation of legal norms and an example of the lack of
    independence of Iran s judiciary. Both experts condemned the executions.
    Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, human rights activists, and the
    International Federation for Human Rights also issued announcements
    protesting the reprisal. Arrest and detention On Saturday September 25,
    2003, agents of the Zahedan Ministry of Intelligence of arrested Mr.
    Abdolvahhab Rigi at the intersection of Moalem and Bozorgmehr Boulevard in
    Zahedan. They possessed no warrant, and beat Rigi while taking him into
    custody. He was then transferred to the Ministry of Intelligence detention
    center in Zahedan. Here Mr. Rigi was imprisoned in solitary confinement
    for 50 days. Rigi reports that during this time he was subjected to
    different physical and mental tortures in order to elicit a confession for
    crimes (he) hadn t committed (letter from prison). Later he was
    transferred to a two-person cell at the detention center. Mr. Rigi was
    deprived of the right to meet his family and access to a lawyer during
    this period. After five months, his family was allowed to meet with him
    for ten minutes. Following this brief exchange, he was again held
    incommunicado for four months (ABF interview). In addition to the
    incarceration of Mr. Rigi and his brother, the Rigi family was put under
    pressure by agents of the Ministry of Intelligence. A relative reported
    that in the days following Mr. Rigi s arrest intelligence operatives
    pressured his father to cooperate. He refused. Agents told the elder Rigi
    that his son was going to be executed. In order to mentally coerce the
    defendant and demoralize his family, agents would sometimes place
    telephone calls to the family during torture sessions in order to relay
    the sound of Rigi s screaming. Female members of the family were also
    humiliated and insulted over their clothing when visiting the Ministry of
    Intelligence facility (ABF interview). After the trial, Mr. Rigi was
    transferred to the quarantine ward in Zahedan Prison along with his
    brother and cellmate. After three months being held incommunicado, they
    were transferred to ward 5 of Zahedan Prison. Rigi and his brother were
    then again relocated to solitary confinement in custody of the Ministry of
    Intelligence: Rigi himself for 20 days, and his brother for a period of
    six months. In May 2012, following a protest of Zahedan Prison s ward 5
    inmates against abusive staff behavior which ended with the violent
    intervention of Special Guards, Mr. Rigi was punitively sent to a small
    confinement cell of
