    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad (Ahad) Shakuri, along with two others,
    was published on the websites of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News
    Agency), Kurdpa News Agency on December 19, 2013, and, along with 17
    others, on the website of Mukrian news agency on December 18, 2013. He was
    from Orumieh. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Shakuri s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Shakuri s trial. Charges According to HRANA, the charge brought
    against Mr. Shakuri was announced as murder. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Shakuri. Defense No information is available on Mr. Shakuri s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Ahmad (Ahad) Shakuri was hanged, along with two others, in
    the Orumieh Central Prison yard on Wednesday December 18, 2013.
