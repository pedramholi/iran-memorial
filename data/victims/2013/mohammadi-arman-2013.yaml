    News of the execution of Mr. Arman Mohammadi was published in various
    sources including the website of Kermanshah Courthouse on August 20, 2013,
    ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on August 25, 2013, and Kordpa on
    August 20, 2013. Additional information was taken from an interview by ABF
    with a person close to Mr. Mohammadi. According to the interviewee, he was
    a resident of Ravansar in Kermanshah, 23 years old, and the only son of
    his family. According to the existing information, Mr. Mohammadi s case
    was related to the murder of a Nissan driver in Ravansar who had resisted
    carjacking by three individuals including Mr. Mohammadi in 2007. (ABF
    interview) Arrest and detention Mr. Mohammadi was arrested by police in
    2007 when he was only 17 years old. He was identified and arrested along
    with two of his friends during a police investigation. (ABF interview) The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Mohammadi was
    detained at the Dizelabad Prison in Kermanshah for six years. (ABF
    interview and Kordpa) Trial No information is available on Mr. Mohammadi s
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Mohammadi was murdering Mr.
    Hassan Ali, 55 years old. (ABF interview and the website of Kermanshah
    Courthouse) The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the interviewee, Mr.
    Mohammadi s confession was essential for his conviction. He had accepted
    the murder charge during the trial. (ABF interview) The evidence provided
    against him and the other defendants in this case included recovery of the
    driver s body, the abandoned [Nissan] truck at Kurzan near Kermanshah, and
    testimonies of those who testified that they witnessed the three
    defendants offer to carry the driver s load. (ABF interview) Defense
    According to the interviewee, two other defendants in the case convinced
    Mr. Mohammadi to take responsibility for the murder of the driver,
    reasoning that he was under aged and the only son of his family and he
    would not be condemned to death. In return, they promised to hire an
    attorney for him and get the victim s family s pardon. Mr. Mohammadi
    accepted their offer. After the ruling was issued, he denied the murder
    charge; however, the judge did not accept his denial. According to the
    person close to him, Mr. Mohammadi s family believes that he did not
    commit the murder and the real murderer is another defendant, who is a
    relative. (ABF interview) International laws have strictly prohibited
    capital punishment for those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation not to impose capital punishment for an offence committed
    before the age of eighteen. A Summary of the Legal Defects in Mr. Arman
    Mohammadi s Case There is no precise information regarding the
    adjudication of the present case and the details of the defense. The
    Boroumand Foundation s interview with a person close to Mr. Arman
    Mohammadi and reports published in certain media nonetheless suggest that
    Mr. Mohammadi s two collaborators were the main perpetrators of the murder
    and had duped Mr. Mohammadi into consenting to confess to the murder, but
    that Mr. Mohammadi had denied committing the murder in court proceedings.
    It is not clear whether the authorities in charge of investigating the
    case paid attention to these statements or not. However, pursuant to
    Iranian law, a confession is valid only when it is true. In other words,
    the judge must conduct the necessary investigation into the veracity of
    the confession. If such investigation was not conducted and Mr. Mohammadi
    was sentenced to death solely based on his preliminary confession, it can
    be said that the ruling was contrary to the law. The other noteworthy
    matter in this case is the modification of the Islamic Penal Code
    regarding the death penalty for individuals under the age of 18. Mr. Arman
    Mohammadi had allegedly committed murder when he was 17 and the death
    sentence was carried out on August 20, 2013. Revisions to the Islamic
    Penal Code were enacted and came into force in April 2013. Pursuant to the
    previous Islamic Penal Code which was in force at the time of the
    commission of the crime, the punishment for young adults (boys who had
    reached the age of 15) was no different than the one for adults. The
    Islamic Penal Code was changed, however, on April 21, 2013, and prescribed
    different rules for crimes committed by individuals under the age of 18.
    Under the old Islamic Penal Code, the punishment for murder for adults
    (those who had reached puberty, i.e., the age of 15 for boys) was Qesas;
    the new Code, however, displaying more flexibility, provides for the
    possibility of dispensing with Qesas for criminals under the age of 18.
    Although the new Code provides the same punishment for crimes that are
