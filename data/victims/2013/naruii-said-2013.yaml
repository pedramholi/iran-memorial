    News of the execution of Mr. Sa id Naruii and fifteen other prisoners was
    published by a number of sources including the Prosecutor General of
    Sistan and Baluchistan Province (October 27, 2013,) Fars News Agency
    (October 26, 2013,) Central News Unit (October 26, 2013,) and HRANA
    (December 11, 2013.) Further information on the case was obtained from
    interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with a person
    familiar with Mr. Naruii (ABF interview) as well as other sources.* Mr.
    Sai d Naruii, son of Mirza, was a young bachelor and member of Iran s
    Baluch minority who lived in Zahedan, Sistan and Baluchistan province. He
    worked as an ordinary laborer. According to an acquaintance, Mr. Naruii
    was an intellectual committed to his Sunni faith. Background Following an
    armed attack by Jaish ul-Adl* on a border station in Saravan, Sistan and
    Baluchistan (Friday night, October 25, 2013), as a result of which at
    least 14 border guards were killed and seven injured, the Ministry of
    Justice of the province reported the execution of 16 prisoners on
    Saturday, October 26. The Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Zahedan
    referred to the execution of the 16 villains connected to enemy groups as
    retaliation. According to the Chief Justice of Sistan and Baluchistan, the
    execution of these convicts had been postponed out of Islamic compassion
    but due to Jaish ul-Adl s assault on provincial border guards and
    insistence on cowardly terrorist attacks, the sentences were at last
    carried out (Asr-e Hamoon, Fars News Agency.) The convicts had been
    arrested during the preceding few years and were not connected to Jaish
    ul-Adl s armed attack, which took place only a few hours before their
    execution. They faced various charges across different cases: according to
    provincial judicial authorities, eight of them had been accused of drug
    offenses (Ministry of Justice of Sistan and Baluchistan.) Human rights
    organizations and activists called this mass summary execution a reprisal
    and protested against the execution of the prisoners who were not directly
    connected to the armed attack. Ahmed Shaheed, United Nations Special
    rapporteur on the Human Rights situation in Iran, called the execution of
    these people a type of retaliation in-kind and an illegal act according to
    international human rights laws. Shirin Ebadi, lawyer and Nobel Peace
    Prize Laureate, and Sarah Leah Whitson, Human Rights Watch expert, also
    considered the execution of the 16 prisoners in retaliation for the border
    guards killing as a violation of legal norms and an indicator of the lack
    of independence of Iran s judiciary. Both experts condemned the
    executions. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, human rights
    activists, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued
    statements protesting the reprisal. Arrest and Detention Precise details
    of Mr. Naruii s arrest and detention are not known. Security agents took
    him into custody in a crowd of laborers gathered at a work site in Zahedan
    before transferring him to solitary confinement in an Intelligence
    Ministry detention facility. An acquaintance of Mr. Naruii s reported that
    he was subjected to torture and threats of arrest to his family here,
    forcing him to falsely confess. After some time, he was transferred to the
    general population of Zahedan Prison (ABF interview.) Trial Mr. Naruii was
    tried by the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Zahedan. Proceedings were
    conducted without the presence of his lawyer (ABF interview.) Charges No
    precise information is available regarding the charges brought against Mr.
    Naruii in court. A statement from the Sistan and Baluchistan Prosecutor
    General details the charges brought against Mr. Naruii and seven other
    codefendants as moharebeh ( war against God, ) corruption on earth through
    collaboration with and membership in Jundullah, and effective
    participation in terrorist incidents in the province in recent years
    (October 27, 2013.) The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt There is no precise
    information regarding the evidence presented at trial. Defense No official
    information is available on Mr. Miaii s defense. The families of some of
    the executed prisoners addressed a letter to Ayatollah Khamenei. Referring
    to the statement of the Deputy Prosecutor of Zahedan in his meeting with
    the families, they wrote You killed 16 of us, so we will kill 16 of you,
    too . Referencing the instances of torture to which the defendants were
    subjected, including connecting electrical cords to the body, pressing hot
    irons against the body, hanging weights from delicate body parts, and
    suspension from the hands and feet, they protested the violation of the
    rights of the defendants and asked for a special team to be sent to
    investigate the issue, to talk to the prisoners about their torture and to
    the families of the executed prisoners to find out why th
