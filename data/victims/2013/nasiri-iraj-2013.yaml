circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Iraj Nasiri, along with two others, was
    published on the websites of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency),
    Kurdpa News Agency on December 19, 2013, and, along with 17 others, on the
    website of Mukrian news agency on December 18, 2013. He was single, from
    Chaldaran in Azerbaijan-e Gharbi.His case was related to a murder that had
    happened when he was younger than 18 years old. International laws have
    strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the
    age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the
    Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence
    committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention According to
    the Mukrian news agency, Mr. Nasiri was arrested when he was 15 and was
    detained for six years. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Nasiri s trial.
    Charges According to HRANA, the charge brought against Mr. Nasiri was
    announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Nasiri. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Nasiri s defense. Judgment Mr. Iraj Nasiri was hanged, along with
    two others, in the Orumieh Central Prison yard on Wednesday December 18,
    2013.
