    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Gorji, along with ten others of whom
    four were unknown and two were female, was published on the website of
    Mukrian news agency on October 30, 2013 and on the website of HRANA (Human
    Rights Activists News Agency) on November 4, 2013. He was a Kurd. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of Mr. Gorji s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Gorji s trial. Charges
    According to reports, the charge brought against Mr. Gorji was announced
    as selling narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Gorji. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Gorji s defense. Judgment Mr. Mohammad
    Gorji was hanged, along with six others, in the Orumieh Central Prison on
    Wednesday October 30, 2013.
