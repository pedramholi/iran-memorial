  - "I was tortured in different ways: for example, there was something called the miracle bed where they would lay us prone with our arms and legs tied down and hit us on our feet with a heavy object after my stay in solitary confinement was over, the most painful torture I suffered was that I was allowed to go to the yard very infrequently and just before being let out, they would say, The last person to come out gets beaten. I would let everyone else go out of the cell first and took the beating myself because I was the youngest. They kicked and punched me and beat me with a pipe. They insulted me and treated me like an animal."

    Mehrollah Rigi was 17 years old at the time of arrest. According to the
    Attorney General of Zahedan, he was executed as retaliation for "Jaish
    ul-Adl" operation. News of the execution of Mr. Mehrolla Rigi (Mahernia)
    and 15 other people was reported by several sources including the Ministry
    of Justice of Sistan and Baluchistan Province (October 27, 2013), Fars
    News Agency (October 26, 2013), Central News Agency (October 26, 2013),
    and HRANA (December 11, 2013). Additional information was obtained from an
    interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with one of
    Mr. Rigi s relatives (ABF interview), Mr. Rigi s voice message from
    Zahedan prison addressed to United Nations special rapporteur (voice
    message), and other resources. Mr. Rigi was an unmarried teenager from
    Zahedan. He was a Sunni Baluchi from the Rigi tribe. Mr. Rigi was 17 at
    the time of his arrest. International law has strictly prohibited the
    death penalty for people who commit a crime while they are under 18 years
    old. Iran, as a member of the International Covenant on Civil and
    Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, has
    undertaken not to execute anyone for the crimes they committed when they
    were a child. Background Following the armed attack by Jaish ul-Adl* on a
    border station in Sarvan, Sistan and Baluchistan (Friday night, October
    25, 2013), as a result of which at least 14 border guards were killed and
    seven injured, the Ministry of Justice of the province reported the
    execution of 16 prisoners on Saturday, October 26. The Public and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor of Zahedan referred to the execution of the 16
    villains connected to enemy groups as retaliation . According to the Chief
    Justice of Sistan and Baluchistan, the execution of these convicts had
    been postponed due to Islamic compassion but due to Jaish ul-Adl s assault
    on provincial border guards and continued cowardly terrorist attacks , the
    sentences were at last carried out (Asrehamoon, Fars News Agency). The
    convicts had been arrested during the few preceding years and were not
    connected to Jaish ul-Adl s armed attack, which took place only a few
    hours before their execution. They faced various charges across different
    cases: according to provincial judicial authorities, eight of them had
    been accused of drug dealing (Ministry of Justice of Sistan and
    Baluchistan). The Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Zahedan referred
    to the execution of the 16 villains connected to enemy groups as
    retaliation . Human rights organizations and activists called this mass
    summary execution a reprisal and protested against the execution of the
    prisoners who were not directly connected to the armed attack. Ahmad
    Shahid, United Nations Special rapporteur on the Human Rights situation in
    Iran, called the execution of these people a kind of retaliation in-kind
    and an illegal act according to international human rights laws. Shirin
    Ebadi, lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, and Sarah Leah Whitson,
    Human Rights Watch expert, also considered the execution of the 16
    prisoners in retaliation for border guards killing as a violation of legal
    norms and an example of the lack of independence of Iran s judiciary. Both
    experts condemned the executions. Amnesty International, Human Rights
    Watch, human rights activists, and the International Federation for Human
    Rights also issued announcements protesting the reprisal. Arrest and
    detention Ministry of Intelligence agents arrested Mr. Rigi on November 1,
    2010 in Kashan. He was first sent to ward 209 of Evin prison. After some
    time, he was transferred to the Ministry of Intelligence detention center
    in Zahedan. He was mentally and physically tortured for 10 months in
    solitary confinement in detention centers at Tehran and Zahedan. Mr. Rigi
    was deprived of the right to call and meet with his family and lawyer
    during this time. Agents of the Ministry of Intelligence allowed him to
    call his family for three minutes after five months; after six months, he
    met his family for the first time. According to Mr. Rigi, he was
    constantly tortured mentally and physically by agents of the Ministry of
    Intelligence during his detention in solitary confinement for a span of 10
    months. He explained the details of this torture in a voice message from
    prison: I was tortured in different ways: for example, there was something
    called the miracle bed where they would lay us prone with our arms and
    legs tied down and hit us on our feet with a heavy object after my stay in
    solitary confinement was over, the most painful torture I suffered was
    that I was allowed to go to the yard very infrequently and just before
    being let out, they would say, The last person to come out gets beaten. I
    would let everyone else go out of the cell first and took the beating
    myself because I was the youngest. They kicked and punched me and beat me
    with a pipe. They insulted me and treated me like an animal. Mr. Rigi was
    pressured by the interrogator to make a confession
