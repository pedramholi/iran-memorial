    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Yadegar (Yadegari), along with seven
    others of whom only three names are known, was published on the website of
    the Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran on July 4, 2013.
    Additionally, news of the execution of 25 individuals with only four names
    was published on the websites of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News
    Agency) and the Iran Human Rights Organization on July 3, 2013. According
    to these reports, 4 individuals were from the Gohardasht Prison and the
    other 21 from the Qezelhesar Prison. The official media in Iran did not
    report these executions. Arrest and detention According to the existing
    information, Mr. Yadegar (Yadegari) was detained in Section 2 of the Raja
    ishahr Prison in Karaj. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Yadegar (Yadegari) s
    trial. Charges According to the Iran Human Rights Organization, the charge
    brought against Mr. Yadegar (Yadegari) was announced as murder. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Yadegar (Yadegari). Defense No information is available on Mr. Yadegar
    (Yadegari) s defense. Judgment Mr. Ali Yadegar (Yadegari) was hanged,
    along with three others, in the Gohardasht (Raja ishahr) Prison yard on
    July 3, 2013 in the morning.
