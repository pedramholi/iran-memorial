    News of the execution of Mr. Ali (Kianush) Naderi, along with another
    person, was published on the websites of Human Rights and Democracy
    Activists in Iran and the Mehr News Agency on January 16, 2013, and Iran
    Human Rights Organization on January 24, 2013. Additional information was
    taken from the website of the Human Rights Organization in Iran on January
    15, 2013, and the Iran and the E temad newspapers on November 30, 2009.
    According to the existing information, Mr. Naderi, 17, was a high school
    student when arrested. His case was related to the murder of an
    eighty-year-old woman on November 12, 2008. According to the Iran
    newspaper, Mr. Naderi, in collaboration with two others, had murdered a
    woman during the robbery from her house. International laws have strictly
    prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18
    at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil
    and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran
    has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed
    before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr. Naderi was arrested
    by police shortly after a murder took place on November 12, 2008. He was
    arrested, along with his two classmates, as a collaborator in robbery and
    murder (Iran and E temad newspapers). He was first detained at the
    Correction and Rehabilitation Center due to being under age. Then, he was
    detained in Hall 3, Section 1 of the Gohardasht Prison in Karaj. He was
    transferred to solitary confinement in Section 5 of the Gohardasht Prison
    on January 15, 2013 to be executed. (Human Rights and Democracy Activists
    in Iran) Trial Branch 71 of the Provincial Criminal Court of Tehran tried
    Mr. Naderi and his collaborator on November 29, 2009. After the
    representative of the Public Prosecutor spoke during the trial, the victim
    s family demanded punishment for all three defendants. Then, Mr. Naderi
    defended himself as the first row defendant. His two collaborators also
    defended themselves. There were one judge and 4 counselors in the court
    for issuing the ruling. (Iran and E temad newspapers) Charges The
    representative of the Public Prosecutor charged Mr. Naderi with murder,
    and the other two collaborators with assistance in murder. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Naderi was his confession and the confession of his collaborators.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense In his defense, Mr. Naderi stated that he did not
    intend to murder the old woman. He only intended to force her to give up
    the key to her safe. Also, he mentioned that he had killed the old woman
    because of the insistence of his friend who was the victim s relative and
    was identified by her. Finally, Mr. Naderi expressed regret. Judgment
    Branch 71 of the Provincial Criminal Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Ali
    (Kianush) Naderi to death. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged in the Gohardasht Prison in Karaj on January 16, 2013 at dawn. One
    of his collaborators was condemned to 15 years and the other to 10 years
    imprisonment.
