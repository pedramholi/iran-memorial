    18, and 23, 2013, and September 7, 2017); Beh Guneh website (September 3,
    2013); National Council of Resistance Women s Commission (September 1,
    2017); Women [are] a Force for Change (September 1, 2017), quoting the
    Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps General Office of Public Relations in
    Mehr News Agency (September 1, and 5, 2013); and Radio Farda (September
    21, 2013). Additional information about this case was obtained from the
    Washington Times English language News Agency (September 1, 2013); Khabar
    Network (September 4, 2013); Fars News Agency (September 7, 2013); Defa
    Moqaddass ( Sacred Defense ) News Agency (July 28, 2014); Jamaran website
    (October 5, 2021); Human Rights Watch (July 31, 2009, and April 15, 2011);
    Foreign Policy magazine (December 17, 2013); and Council to Human Rights
    Association for Migrants Rights for Migrants (Perseus) report (October 30,
    2013). According to information published on the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran s websites*, Ms. Giveh Chinianzadeh was 55 years old
    and born in Tehran. She was involved in political activities with militant
    students before the Revolution and began her political activities after
    the Revolution with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran. Initially,
    she was active in the pamphlet sales team, and was subsequently put in
    charge of East Tehran students in mid 1979. (Hambastegi, Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran). In early 1983, Ms. Giveh Chinianzadeh was
    dispatched abroad. She was in charge of the Mojahedin Organization
    children s educational complexes in France, Baghdad, and Kirkuk, from 1983
    until 1987-88. She then became the person in charge of the Hanif Base in
    Baghdad in 1987-88. In 1992-93, she became the head of the liberation army
    s specialized headquarters. She was also the commander of counter
    intelligence in Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran s national liberation
    army , and was a senior member of that Organization s leadership council.
    At the time [it was decided that] the Ashraf Base** would be evacuated in
    2013, so that Mojahedin Khalq members could be transferred to Camp
    Liberty*** - which was under the protection of the United States 100 (or
    101) of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran members remained at
    Ashraf Base, among whom was Ms. Giveh Chinianzadeh. According to the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran, she and 99 of her cohorts, none of
    whom were armed , were in charge of selling the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran s assets at the Ashraf Base. Background In 1986, the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran s leadership, members, and supporters
    went to Iraq after they were expelled from France, and settled in the
    Ashraf Base. The Ashraf Base was located in the north of Diala Province,
    80 kilometers (50 miles) from Baghdad. In 1987, the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran established the national liberation army at this
    base, and the Organization s members were trained there. The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization of Iran had several bases in Iraq in the years the
    Organization remained in that country, and from there, they were able to
    attack Iran four times in operations called Aftab (March 28, 1988),
    Chelcheragh (June 18, 1988), Forugh-e Javidan (July 25, 1988), and
    Morvarid (March 9, 1991). In the three decades the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran was in Iraq, the Ashraf Base was repeatedly the
    subject of missile, air, and ground attacks by the Iranian regime, which
    resulted in the killing and wounding of Mojahedin Khalq members. The base
    was also bombed several times during the United States war with Iraq in
    2003, inflicting casualties as well as property and financial damage.
    After the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) attack on Iraq,
    and the disarming of the Mojahedin members, the residents of the Ashraf
    Base came under the protection of U.S. forces. A number of intelligence
    services, including the FBI, went to the Ashraf Base on behalf of the
    United States government and conducted one on one interviews with every
    single member of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran. All of the
    Mojahedin Khalq members backgrounds and records of activities were
    investigated in the course of these interviews. Once the investigations
    were over, it became clear that Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran
    members had not violated any laws, and had also remained impartial during
    the war. Therefore, in 2004, the multinational forces led by the United
    States, recognized all of ashraf s residents as protected persons under
    the Fourth Geneva Convention. With the gradual withdrawal of the U.S.
    forces from Iraqi cities in the summer of 2009, the United States
    relinquished protection of Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran members t
