    News of the execution of Mr. Sa id Afshar, along with seven others of
    which only 3 names are known, was published on the website of the Human
    Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran on July 4, 2013. Additionally, news
    of the execution of 25 individuals with only four names was published on
    the websites of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) and the Iran
    Human Rights Organization on July 3, 2013. Mr. Afshar is among these
    individuals whose names was not mentioned. According to these reports, 4
    individuals were from the Gohardasht Prison and the other 21 from the
    Qezelhesar Prison. The official media in Iran did not report these
    executions. According to the existing information, Mr. Afshar was single,
    and less than 18 years old at the time of the committed crime.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention
    on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and
    detention According to the Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran,
    Mr. Afshar was arrested when he was only 15 and was detained for more than
    10 years. He had been detained in Section 3 of the Gohardasht Prison in
    Karaj. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    No information is available on Mr. Afshar s trial. Charges According to
    the Iran Human Rights Organization, the charge brought against Mr. Afshar
    was announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Afshar. Defense Mr. Afshar was less than 18
    when arrested. No information is available on his defense. Judgment Mr. Sa
    id Afshar was hanged, along with three others, in the Gohardasht Prison
    yard on July 3, 2013 in the morning.
