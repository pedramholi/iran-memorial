    extrajudicial executions of Kurdish citizens and activists. For this
    purpose, the network has used the experiences and research methodology of
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, which has been active in the field of
    documenting human rights violations in Iran for many years. The report of
    this case and subsequent reports will be published in the "documentation"

    Life Party (PJAK) The Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) is a leftist
    organization established in January 2004 with the aim of creating "a
    democratic-ecological and gender-equal society" within the framework of a
    democratic and federal government in Iran, where autonomy is granted to
    all ethnic minorities. It held its first congress on 25 April 2004. The
    party, led by Abdul Rahman Haji Ahmadi, has very close ties with the PKK
    Party in Turkey, and regards Apo "Abdullah Ocalan" as its spiritual
    leader. PJAK mostly has influence in the northern parts of Iranian
    Kurdistan, where it is engaged in an armed struggle against the Islamic
    Republic. PJAK refers to Iranian Kurdistan as East Kurdistan. The Kurdish
    Problem in the Islamic Republic After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the
    disagreements between the government of the Shiite Islamic Republic and
    the organizations in the Kurdish regions of western Iran regarding the
    rights and roles of minorities in drafting the Constitution; whether the
    government should be secular or religious, and especially the issue of
    Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in Kurdish political
    organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on instituting an
    Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed, clashes between the
    central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan Democratic Party s armed
    forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini labeled the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and most influential Kurdish
    Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it unofficial and illegal ,
    and ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass executions and intense
    armed clashes continued in the region for months, clashes that resulted in
