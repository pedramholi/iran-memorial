    Even at the time of my arrest, I was not willing to use my gun and shoot.
    The feelings I carried within me were not terror, fear and violence; on
    the contrary, my heart was filled with love for humanity and a desire for
    freedom Mr. Shirko Ma arefi s execution was reported by several sources
    including Bultan News (November 5, 2013), The Campaign to Defend Political
    and Civil Prisoners (November 4, 2013), Kurdpa (November 4, 2013), and the
    International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran (November 5, 2013).
    Additional information regarding this matter was obtained from a voice
    message and open letters by Mr. Ma arefi from prison, the interviews of
    his lawyers, his father s interviews, his friend s interview with the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC Interview) and other sources*. Mr.
    Ma'arefi was a single young Kurd from Baneh in Kurdistan. He was from a
    middle class family who would go to villages for farming in the spring and
    summer and would come back to Baneh in the fall. Mr. Ma'arefi studied up
    to high school. According to one of his friends, he was funny and lively;
    he always laughed and would do whatever he could for his friends.He joined
    Komala Party in 2004 and was a Peshmerga for four years. During his
    membership in Komala, he was reprimanded several times due to disruption
    of the party's order. He was once expelled temporarily during which time
    he worked at a bakery in Sulaymaniyah, Iraq for two months (ABC
    Interview). Several remaining members of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of
    Iran established the Revolutionary Organization of this party in Iraq in
    the mid-1960s. Esma il Sharifzadeh, Abdollah Mo ini, and Molaavareh were
    among the leaders of this organization who, inspired by the Cuban
    Revolution, began an armed guerrilla struggle in Kurdistan. When this
    group was defeated in 1969 and several of its members were arrested, armed
    struggle was criticized and the Maoist trend was overcome. When some of
    its leaders were released in 1978, the Revolutionary Organization of
    Working People in Kurdistan Komala was established. Based on Marxist
    theory, Komala was against the capitalists and landlords and encouraged
    workers and peasants in Kurdistan to an armed uprising against them and
    the central government. This organization considered the Kurdish
    Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI) to be the party of the wealthy and
    campaigned against it, resulting in several armed conflicts and hundreds
    dead. In 1982, Komala joined another Marxist group, Sahand, which was
    primarily concerned with theory, and established the Communist Party of
    Iran. Then it became the Kurdistan Organization of the Communist Party of
    Iran Komala. Years later, this organization separated from the Communist
    Party of Iran and faced several schisms. The Komala Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan, led by Abdollah Mohtadi, Komala, and the Kurdistan Organization
    of the Communist Party of Iran led by Ebrahim Alizadeh are some of these
    factions. The issuing and implementation of the death sentence against Mr.
    Ma arefi provoked many reactions. A number of Kurd representatives of
    Islamic Consultative Assembly wrote a letter to the Chief Justice of Iran
    demanding that he stop the execution of some young Kurds including Mr. Ma
    arefi and expressed concern about the negative national and international
    impacts of their execution and resentment of Kurds against the system
    (Radio Farda, November 17, 2009). The current president of Iraq at the
    time, Jalal Talabani, demanded that the Chief Justice of Iran stop the
    execution of Mr. Ma arefi and another Kurd activist during his trip to
    Iran in December, 2009 (Radio Farda, November 25, 2009). Amnesty
    International (March 30 and May 13, 2011; November 25, 2013) and Human
    Rights Watch (July 28, 2010) issued a statement and called for urgent
    action demanding annulment of the death penalty of Mr. Ma arefi. Coalition
    Against the Death Penalty (November 4, 2013), the largest coalition
    against the death penalty in the world issued a statement condemning
    executions including the execution of Mr. Ma arefi, while demanding that
    the European Union, the United Nations, and the international community
    address the issue of the death penalty in any negotiations with Islamic
    Republic authorities ( Rooz Online , October 26, 2015). Arrest and
    detention While carrying out campaign activities, Mr. Ma arefi was
    arrested by the Revolutionary Guards in a village named Dara Qal e near
    Saqez, and he was transferred to the detention center of the Revolutionary
    Guards headquarters on July 30, 2008. Although he was armed when arrested,
    he surrendered himself to the Revolutionary Guards without using his gun.
    This was confirmed by his lawyer (Iran Emrooz, January 30, 2010). After a
    week, security guards transferred Mr. Ma arefi to the Ministry of
    Intelligence detention center of Sanandaj and transferred him to Saqez
    Central Prison after two months. He was tortured physically and mentally
    in the Ministry of Intelligence detention center of Sanadaj. In a
