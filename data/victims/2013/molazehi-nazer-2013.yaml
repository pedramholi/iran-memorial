    News of the execution of Mr. Nazer Molazehi and 15 other inmates was
    published by a number of sources, including the Sistan va Baluchestan
    Judiciary (October 27, 2013,) Fars News Agency (October 26, 2013,) the
    Central News Unit (October 26, 2013,) and the Human Rights News Agency
    (December 11, 2013.) Further information on the case was obtained from an
    audio message recorded by Molazehi and addressed to the UN Special
    Rapporteur for Human Rights in Iran from inside prison (hereafter referred
    to as audio message, ) as well as other sources. Mr. Molazehi was an
    unmarried 26-year-old member of Iran s Baluch minority who resided in
    Saravan, Sistan va Baluchestan province (audio message.) Background
    Following an armed attack by Jaish ul-Adl* on a border station in Saravan,
    Sistan va Baluchestan (Friday night, October 25, 2013), as a result of
    which at least 14 border guards were killed and seven injured, the
    Ministry of Justice of the province reported the execution of 16 prisoners
    on Saturday, October 26. The Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of
    Zahedan referred to the execution of the 16 villains connected to enemy
    groups as retaliation. According to the Chief Justice of Sistan and
    Baluchistan, the execution of these convicts had been postponed out of
    Islamic compassion but due to Jaish ul-Adl s assault on provincial border
    guards and insistence on cowardly terrorist attacks, the sentences were at
    last carried out (Asr-e Hamoon, Fars News Agency.) The convicts had been
    arrested during the preceding few years and were not connected to Jaish
    ul-Adl s armed attack, which took place only a few hours before their
    execution. They faced various charges across different cases: according to
    provincial judicial authorities, eight of them had been accused of drug
    offenses (Ministry of Justice of Sistan and Baluchistan.) Human rights
    organizations and activists called this mass summary execution a reprisal
    and protested against the execution of the prisoners who were not directly
    connected to the armed attack. Ahmed Shaheed, United Nations Special
    rapporteur on the Human Rights situation in Iran, called the execution of
    these people a type of retaliation in-kind and an illegal act according to
    international human rights laws. Shirin Ebadi, lawyer and Nobel Peace
    Prize Laureate, and Sarah Leah Whitson, Human Rights Watch expert, also
    considered the execution of the 16 prisoners in retaliation for the border
    guards killing as a violation of legal norms and an indicator of the lack
    of independence of Iran s judiciary. Both experts condemned the
    executions. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, human rights
    activists, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued
    statements protesting the reprisal. Arrest and detention Agents of the
    Saravan County Intelligence Office took Molazehi into custody on July 19,
    2010 and transferred him to the Intelligence Office detention facility in
    Zahedan (audio file.) Here he spent ten months in solitary confinement and
    was subjected to physical and mental torture. In an audio message
    addressed to the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights, Molazehi recounted
    psychological pressure, repeated beatings, and various forms of torture
    including being tied down to a miracle bed device and connected to a
    220-volt electric charge. As a result of such stresses Mr. Molazehi
    developed a kidney ailment and gastric pains. On May 21, 2011, Molazehi
    was relocated to Zahedan Central Prison. On August 20, 2013, he was again
    placed in solitary confinement for engaging in a hunger strike. Trial
    Branch 1 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran tried Mr. Molazehi
    in a closed-door session in October of 2011 (audio file.) No information
    is available regarding the details of the trial session. Charges The court
    accused Mr. Molazehi of moharebeh ( war against God ) through membership
    in the Jundullah* organization and armed action against Iran through
    martyring Majib Alrahman Raeesi (audio file.) According to an October 27,
    2013 statement from the Sistan va Baluchestan Prosecutor General, the
    charges levelled against Molazehi and eight other defendants comprised
    moharebeh, corruption on earth through collaboration with the Jundullah
    group, and effective participation in terrorist incidents in recent years.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    Though information regarding Molazehi s trial defense is lacking, his
    audio message indicates that he denied the charges levelled against him,
    deeming the legal proceedings a show trial which had charged him without
    any sort of evidence, reason, or witnesses. In a written letter to UN
    Special Rapporteur Ahmed Shaheed, he stressed that he had had no
    involvement with the Jundullah organization, asking: Given that
