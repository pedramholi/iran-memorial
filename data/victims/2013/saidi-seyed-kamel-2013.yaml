    News of the execution of Mr. Seyed Kamel Sa idi, along with ten others of
    whom four were unknown and two were female, was published on the website
    of Mukrian news agency on October 30, 2013 and on the website of HRANA
    (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on November 4, 2013. News of his
    arrest was also published on the website of the Human Rights Organization
    of Kurdistan (Ensaniat) on December 7, 2007. He was a Kurd. Arrest and
    detention According to the Ensaniat report, Mr. Sa idi was arrested by
    security forces at his work place in Tanaguray Market (a market famous for
    second hand clothes) in Mahabad, and transferred to the prison. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Sa idi s trial. Charges According to
    reports, the charge brought against Mr. Sa idi was announced as selling
    narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Sa idi. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Sa idi s defense. Judgment Mr. Seyed Kamel Sa idi was
    hanged, along with six others, in the Orumieh Central Prison on Wednesday
    October 30, 2013.
