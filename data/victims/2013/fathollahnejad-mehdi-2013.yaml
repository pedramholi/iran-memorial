    According to information published in Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran
    s websites, Mr. Fathollahnejad, 62 years old and born in Tabriz, completed
    his primary and secondary education in Tabriz. In 1969, at the age of 18,
    he entered the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Tehran. In
    1971, he became acquainted with the Mojahedin Organization and, along with
    several other students, began distributing leaflets and providing
    financial support to the organization. In 1974, he was arrested and
    sentenced to three years in prison. After his release, Mr. Fathollahnejad
    continued to support the organization. Following June 30, 1981, he managed
    to travel to Kurdistan. In the Alan region of Kurdistan, he was known by
    the name "Kak Behruz." There, he was responsible for the Mojahedin base
    and, after the formation of the Liberation Army, he went to Iraq and
    continued his activities there. At the time [it was decided that] the
    Ashraf Base* would be evacuated in 2013, so that Mojahedin Khalq members
    could be transferred to Camp Liberty** which was under the protection of
    the United States 100 (or 101) of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran
    members remained at Ashraf Base, among whom was Mr. Fathollahnejad.
    According to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran, he and 99 of his
    cohorts, none of whom were armed , were in charge of selling the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization of Iran s assets at the Ashraf Base. Background In
    1986, the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran s leadership, members, and
    supporters went to Iraq after they were expelled from France, and settled
    in the Ashraf Base. The Ashraf Base was located in the north of Diala
    Province, 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Baghdad. In 1987, the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization of Iran established the national liberation army at
    this base, and the Organization s members were trained there. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran had several bases in Iraq in the
    years the Organization remained in that country, and from there, they were
    able to attack Iran four times in operations called Aftab (March 28,
    1988), Chelcheragh (June 18, 1988), Forugh-e Javidan (July 25, 1988), and
    Morvarid (March 9, 1991). In the three decades the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran was in Iraq, the Ashraf Base was repeatedly the
    subject of missile, air, and ground attacks by the Iranian regime, which
    resulted in the killing and wounding of Mojahedin Khalq members. The base
    was also bombed several times during the United States war with Iraq in
    2003, inflicting casualties as well as property and financial damage.
    After the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) attack on Iraq,
    and the disarming of the Mojahedin members, the residents of the Ashraf
    Base came under the protection of U.S. forces. A number of intelligence
    services, including the FBI, went to the Ashraf Base on behalf of the
    United States government and conducted one on one interviews with every
    single member of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran. All of the
    Mojahedin Khalq members backgrounds and records of activities were
    investigated in the course of these interviews. Once the investigations
    were over, it became clear that Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran
    members had not violated any laws, and had also remained impartial during
    the war. Therefore, in 2004, the multinational forces led by the United
    States, recognized all of Ashraf's residents as protected persons under
    the Fourth Geneva Convention. With the gradual withdrawal of the U.S.
    forces from Iraqi cities in the summer of 2009, the United States
    relinquished protection of Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran members to
    Iraq. The settlement of Iraqi armed forces around the base was accompanied
    by clashes and bloodshed. After Iraqi authorities announced several times
    their intention to take Ashraf Base and evict its residents, Iraqi forces
    attacked the base on July 28, and 29, 2009, using bulldozers, tear gas,
    water cannons, and clubs. According to available information, Mojahedin
    Khalq members formed a human chain in front of the attackers and tried to
    prevent them from entering the base. In the course of this attack, which
    resulted in the installation of a police post inside the base, at least
    seven Mojahedin members were killed, and a large number were wounded and
    arrested. (Amnesty International, September 2, 2013, and Human Rights
    Watch, July 31, 2009). On April 8, 2011, Iraqi forces attacked the Ashraf
    Base one more time, for unknown reasons. According to the United Nations
    Human Rights Commission spokesperson, 28 members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran forces were shot and killed, 6 disappeared, and
    dozens more were wounded. The Iraqi Prime Minister s Office spokesman
    attributed the killing of Mojahedin forces on April 8, to the Mojahedin
    guards. (Human Rights Watch, April 15, 2011). According to available
    information, although Amnesty International had asked Iraqi authorities to
    conduct thorough and impartial investigations of
