    Agency (September 1, and 5, 2013); and Radio Farda (September 21, 2013).
    Additional information about this case was obtained from the Washington

    2013). According to available information, Ms. Qa emi was born in Tehran.
    She was 49 years old and she had spent three years at Alavi school in
    Tehran for her middle school education. Ms. Qa emi joined the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization* through her brother, in the summer of 1979, when she
    was 15. She was arrested during one of the street demonstrations of the
    Mojahedin, before June 20, 1981. She was in Qezel Hesar Prison until June
    1986. After she was released from prison in December 1986, she was
    attached to the organization through Radio Mojahed, and she was sent to
    Iraq on February 26, 1987. She participated in Operation Chelcheragh and
    Operation Forough Javidan against Iran, as one of the senior commanders in
    the Mojahedin Liberation Army. In August 2011, she was introduced as the
    Deputy Secretary General of the Mojahedin Organization. On July 28 or 29,
    2009, during one of the raids carried out by Iraqi forces on Camp Ashraf,
    Ms. Qa emi was hit by a bullet and sustained a leg injury. Background In
    1986, the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran s leadership, members, and
    supporters went to Iraq after they were expelled from France, and settled
    in the Ashraf Base. The Ashraf Base was located in the north of Diala
    Province, 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Baghdad. In 1987, the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization of Iran established the national liberation army at
    this base, and the Organization s members were trained there. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran had several bases in Iraq in the
    years the Organization remained in that country, and from there, they were
    able to attack Iran four times in operations called Aftab (March 28,
    1988), Chelcheragh (June 18, 1988), Forugh-e Javidan (July 25, 1988), and
    Morvarid (March 9, 1991). In the three decades the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization of Iran was in Iraq, the Ashraf Base was repeatedly the
    subject of missile, air, and ground attacks by the Iranian regime, which
    resulted in the killing and wounding of Mojahedin Khalq members. The base
    was also bombed several times during the United States war with Iraq in
    2003, inflicting casualties as well as property and financial damage.
    After the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) attack on Iraq,
    and the disarming of the Mojahedin members, the residents of the Ashraf
    Base came under the protection of U.S. forces. A number of intelligence
    services, including the FBI, went to the Ashraf Base on behalf of the
    United States government and conducted one on one interviews with every
    single member of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran. All of the
    Mojahedin Khalq members backgrounds and records of activities were
    investigated in the course of these interviews. Once the investigations
    were over, it became clear that Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran
    members had not violated any laws, and had also remained impartial during
    the war. Therefore, in 2004, the multinational forces led by the United
    States, recognized all of ashraf s residents as protected persons under
    the Fourth Geneva Convention. With the gradual withdrawal of the U.S.
    forces from Iraqi cities in the summer of 2009, the United States
    relinquished protection of Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran members to
    Iraq. The settlement of Iraqi armed forces around the base was accompanied
    by clashes and bloodshed. After Iraqi authorities announced several times
    their intention to take Ashraf Base and evict its residents, Iraqi forces
    attacked the base on July 28, and 29, 2009, using bulldozers, tear gas,
    water cannons, and clubs. According to available information, Mojahedin
    Khalq members formed a human chain in front of the attackers and tried to
    prevent them from entering the base. In the course of this attack, which
    resulted in the installation of a police post inside the base, at least
    seven Mojahedin members were kille
