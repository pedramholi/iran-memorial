    News of the execution of Mr. Najibollah Bahadori, son of Amir, along with
    15 others, was published by various sources including the website of the
    Sistan Va Baluchestan Courthouse on October 27, 2013, Fars news agency and
    News Central Unit on October 26, 2013, and HRANA (Human Rights Activists
    News Agency) on December 11, 2013. Additional information was taken from
    research by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with people close to the
    victims and other sources*. Background Following an armed attack by Jaish
    ul-Adl* on a border station in Saravan, Sistan Va Baluchestan (Friday
    night, October 25, 2013), as a result of which at least 14 border guards
    were killed and seven injured, the Ministry of Justice of the province
    reported the execution of 16 prisoners on Saturday, October 26. The Public
    and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Zahedan referred to the execution of the
    16 villains connected to enemy groups as retaliation. According to the
    Chief Justice of Sistan Va Baluchestan, the execution of these convicts
    had been postponed out of Islamic compassion but due to Jaish ul-Adl s
    assault on provincial border guards and insistence on cowardly terrorist
    attacks, the sentences were at last carried out (Asr-e Hamoon, Fars News
    Agency.) The convicts had been arrested during the preceding few years and
    were not connected to Jaish ul-Adl s armed attack, which took place only a
    few hours before their execution. They faced various charges across
    different cases: according to provincial judicial authorities, eight of
    them had been accused of drug offenses (Ministry of Justice of Sistan Va
    Baluchestan.) Human rights organizations and activists called this mass
    summary execution a reprisal and protested against the execution of the
    prisoners who were not directly connected to the armed attack. Ahmed
    Shaheed, United Nations Special rapporteur on the Human Rights situation
    in Iran, called the execution of these people a type of retaliation
    in-kind and an illegal act according to international human rights laws.
    Shirin Ebadi, lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, and Sarah Leah
    Whitson, Human Rights Watch expert, also considered the execution of the
    16 prisoners in retaliation for the border guards killing as a violation
    of legal norms and an indicator of the lack of independence of Iran s
    judiciary. Both experts condemned the executions. Amnesty International,
    Human Rights Watch, human rights activists, and the International
    Federation for Human Rights also issued statements protesting the
    reprisal. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Bahadori s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Bahadori s trial. Charges According to the Sistan Va Baluchestan
    Courthouse, the charges brought against Mr. Bahadori were announced as
    transportation and possession of 5 kilograms of heroin. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Bahadori.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Bahadori s defense. The
    families of some of the executed prisoners addressed a letter to Ayatollah
    Khamenei. Referring to the statement of the Deputy Prosecutor of Zahedan
    in his meeting with the families, they wrote You killed 16 of us, so we
    will kill 16 of you, too . They protested the violation of the rights of
    the defendants and asked for a special team to be sent to investigate the
    issue, to talk to the prisoners about their torture and to the families of
    the executed prisoners to find out why their children had been executed.
    (HRANA, December 11, 2011) Judgment A court condemned Mr. Najibollah
    Bahadori to death. No specific information is available about the court
    that ordered this execution. According to the Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor of Zahedan, the judicial authorities confirmed the ruling;
    however, no details were specified regarding the court branch or the time
    of the confirmation. (Sistan Va Baluchestan Courthouse) Mr. Bahadori was
    hanged, along with 15 others, in Zaheda
