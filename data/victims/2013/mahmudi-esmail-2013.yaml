    News of the execution of Mr. Esma il Mahmudi, son of Musa, along with
    another person, was published on the websites of the Hormozgan Provincial
    Courthouse and IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on November 12, 2013,
    and on the websites of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) and the
    Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran on November 7, 2013.
    According to the Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan Provincial
    Courthouse, Mr. Mahmudi s case and another person s case were related to
    the kidnapping and murder of an eight-year-old boy in 2009. According to
    HRANA, Mr. Mahmudi was from Benzak near Minab. He was single and only 16
    years old when the crime was committed. International laws have strictly
    prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18
    at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil
    and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran
    has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed
    before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention According to the existing
    information, after the family of a missing boy reported it to the police,
    the search for him began with a judicial order. The kidnappers' hiding
    place was discovered and Mr. Mahmudi and another person were arrested by
    the police. (Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse) The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Mahmudi was detained in Section 2
    of the Bandar-e Abbas Central Prison since 2009. (Human Rights and
    Democracy Activists in Iran) Trial The Criminal Court of Hormozgan tried
    Mr. Mahmudi. (Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse) No information is available
    on his trial. Charges According to the Public Relations Office of the
    Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse, the charge brought against Mr. Mahmudi
    was announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Mahmudi was his confession and the confession of his
    collaborator. (Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse) International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Mahmudi s defense. Judgment The Criminal Court of
    Hormozgan condemned Mr. Esma il Mahmudi to death. The Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling and the Head of the judiciary sign it. He was hanged,
    along with his collaborator, at the Bandar-e Abbas Central Prison on
    November 7, 2013 in the morning.
