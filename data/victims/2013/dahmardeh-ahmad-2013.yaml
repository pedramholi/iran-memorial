    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad Dahmarde, son of Khodarahm, along with
    15 others, was published by various sources including the website of the
    Sistan Va Baluchistan Courthouse on October 27, 2013, Fars news agency and
    News Central Unit on October 26, 2013, and HRANA (Human Rights Activists
    News Agency) on December 11, 2013. Additional information was taken from
    research by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with people close to the
    victims, and other sources.* Background Following an armed attack by Jaish
    ul-Adl* on a border station in Saravan, Sistan Va Baluchestan (Friday
    night, October 25, 2013), as a result of which at least 14 border guards
    were killed and seven injured, the Ministry of Justice of the province
    reported the execution of 16 prisoners on Saturday, October 26. The Public
    and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Zahedan referred to the execution of the
    16 villains connected to enemy groups as retaliation. According to the
    Chief Justice of Sistan Va Baluchestan, the execution of these convicts
    had been postponed out of Islamic compassion but due to Jaish ul-Adl s
    assault on provincial border guards and insistence on cowardly terrorist
    attacks, the sentences were at last carried out (Asr-e Hamoon, Fars News
    Agency.) The convicts had been arrested during the preceding few years and
    were not connected to Jaish ul-Adl s armed attack, which took place only a
    few hours before their execution. They faced various charges across
    different cases: according to provincial judicial authorities, eight of
    them had been accused of drug offenses (Ministry of Justice of Sistan Va
    Baluchestan.) Human rights organizations and activists called this mass
    summary execution a reprisal and protested against the execution of the
    prisoners who were not directly connected to the armed attack. Ahmed
    Shaheed, United Nations Special rapporteur on the Human Rights situation
    in Iran, called the execution of these people a type of retaliation
    in-kind and an illegal act according to international human rights laws.
    Shirin Ebadi, lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, and Sarah Leah
    Whitson, Human Rights Watch expert, also considered the execution of the
    16 prisoners in retaliation for the border guards killing as a violation
    of legal norms and an indicator of the lack of independence of Iran s
    judiciary. Both experts condemned the executions. Amnesty International,
    Human Rights Watch, human rights activists, and the International
    Federation for Human Rights also issued statements protesting the
    reprisal. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Dahmarde s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Dahmarde s trial. Charges According to the Sistan Va Baluchistan
    Courthouse, the charges brought against Mr. Dahmarde were announced as
    transportation and possession of 13 kilograms of heroin and 50 kilograms
    of opium. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Dahmarde. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Dahmarde s defense. The families of some of the executed
    prisoners addressed a letter to Ayatollah Khamenei. Referring to the
    statement of the Deputy Prosecutor of Zahedan in his meeting with the
    families, they wrote You killed 16 of us, so we will kill 16 of you, too .
    They protested the violation of the rights of the defendants and asked for
    a special team to be sent to investigate the issue, to talk to the
    prisoners about their torture and to the families of the executed
    prisoners and find out why their children had been executed. (HRANA,
    December 11, 2011) A Summary of the Legal Defects in the Adjudication of
    Mr. Ahmad Dahmardeh s Case Mr. Dahmardeh was tried on the basis of the
    charge of Moharebeh ( waging war with God ) which carries the death
    penalty. According to available information and to sources with knowledge
    of the case, he did not have access to an attorney in the course of the
    trial, and whatever access he did have, was extremely limited. Pursua
