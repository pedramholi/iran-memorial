    News of the execution of Majid Esma ilzadeh was published by Iran Human
    Rights (IHR) and Human Rights Activists (HRANA) on April 18, 2020. As of
    three weeks following the execution, news of his hanging had yet to be
    reported by either Iranian officials or state-sponsored news sources.
    Majid Esma'ilzadeh was born on September 1, 1998, and his father was a
    laborer of limited financial means. International laws have strictly
    prohibited capital punishment for those who were under the age of 18 at
    the time of committing a crime. As a party to the International Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the
    Child, Iran has the obligation not to impose capital punishment for an
    offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Esma ilzadeh was arrested on April 26, 2015. His father said he reported
    being beaten with batons while in custody, and that his whole body was
    black and blue. Trial Mr. Esma ilzadeh was tried in Branch 1 of Ardabil
    Children s court and assigned a public defender. Charges Mr. Esma ilzadeh
    was charged with intentional murder. He was charged to have killed a
    45-year-old man. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information on the evidence provided
    against the defendant, however his father refers to a confession.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress . Defense Mr. Esma ilzadeh s father continues to profess his
    son s innocence, stating that his son was tortured into giving a false
    confession. Mr. Esma ilzadeh was a minor at the time of the alleged
    offense (16). Under Article 91 of the Islamic Penal code, in force since
    2013, judges can spare minor defendants who would otherwise be subject to
    harsh sentences by hadd or qesas when evidence casts doubt on their
    ability to comprehend the nature or impact of the crime. To this end,
    based on available information, Mr. Esma ilzadeh was evaluated twice by an
    expert, but nothing more is known about the results. Mr. Esma ilzadeh s
    poverty barred him access to adequate legal services. His father stated
    that the public defender assigned to him was ineffective. Every time I
    went to court [for my son s case], they told me to bug off, he told IHR. I
    called [the public defender] a thousand times and never heard back from
    him once. Speaking to the crime itself, Mr. Esma ilzadeh s father stated
    that a coroner at the time reported the victim s cause of death not as
    homicide, but as injuries incurred from a car accident: he said that the
    alleged murder victim had gone off with his son to a secluded area after
    offering him money in exchange for sexual favors. After the two had
    consumed some alcohol, the man fell asleep while Mr. Esma ilzadeh returned
    home. At this point, his father explained, the man woke up and wandered
    into the road in a drunken state, where he was struck and killed by a car.
    It s been five years and they still haven t given us the [coroner s]
    report, Mr. Esma ilzadeh s father said. Judgment Branch 1 of Ardabil
    Children s court sentenced Majid Esma ilzadeh to death. Majid Esma;ilzadeh
    was hanged in the Central Prison of Ardebil on April 18, 2020. To IHR, his
    father lamented being summoned by prison officials at the eleventh hour
    for their final goodbyes: Just like that, I get a call from them telling
    me to come see my son!
