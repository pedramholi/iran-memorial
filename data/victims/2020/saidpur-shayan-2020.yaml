    News of the execution of Shayan Sa'idpur (also spelled Saeedpour) was
    published by both Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) and Islamic
    Republic News Agency (IRNA) on April 21, 2020. Additional information was
    gathered through an Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran
    (ABC) interview with an informed source on February 2, 2019; from HRANA
    reports published December 6, 2018 and April 19, 2020; from an IRNA
    article dated April 5, 2020; from an Amnesty International report dated
    April 21, 2020; and from an April 22, 2020 statement from the UN High
    Commissioner for Human Rights. On April 21, 2020, both IRNA and Mizan
    Online News Agency disputed reports from human rights bodies stating that
    he was a minor at the time of his offense, and that his criminal
    responsibility was further diminished by other case facts. Information
    regarding Mr. Sa'idpur's prison conditions was drawn from the ABC report
    COVID-19 Fear in Iran's Prisons , published April 21, 2020. Mr. Sa'idpur
    was born September 21, 1997 and was a native of Saqqez, Kurdistan
    Province. According to a family member, he competed in Zurkhaneh, a form
    of traditional Iranian athletics, for which he previously placed top in
    his province and third in the country. His family and an informed source
    reported that he struggled with mental health issues (HRANA 12/6/2018).
    This case was brought about by the killing of a young man in a street
    fight that broke out among a group of youth on August 16, 2015 (HRANA
    12/6/2018). Iran counts among the small number of countries who sentence
    juvenile offenders to death, and has in recent years issued more death
    sentences to juvenile offenders than any other country in the world. In
    2019, at least four children were executed in Iran. The age of maturity in
    the Islamic Republic is currently set at 15 years for boys and 9 years for
    girls. International human rights organizations, including Amnesty
    International and the United Nations, have condemned the execution of Mr.
    Sa idpur, which per the statement of UN High Commissioner Michelle
    Bachelet is absolutely prohibited under international human rights law. In
    her statement published April 22, 2020, Bachelet noted: Despite repeated
    interventions and engagement by my own Office with the Government of Iran
    on this issue, the sentencing and executions of child offenders continue,
    Bachelet said. This is both regrettable and, given the clear illegality of
    these actions, reprehensible. I repeat my call on Iranian authorities to
    honour its international human rights obligations, immediately halt all
    executions of juvenile offenders and commute all such death sentences.
    International laws strictly prohibit capital punishment against those
    under the age of 18 at the time of committing a crime. As a party to the
    Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of
    the Child, Iran is bound to abstain from capital punishment in the cases
    of such juvenile offenders. Arrest and detention Accompanied by his
    father, Mr. Sa'idpur turned himself into police in the city of Bukan on
    August 19, 2015, three days after he fatally wounded a fellow Saqqez
    native named Soleiman Azadi in a street fight that had broken out among a
    group of youth on August 16, 2015 (HRANA 12/6/2018). While imprisoned in
    Saqqez, Mr. Sa idpur was among a group of more than 70 inmates that
    managed to escape on March 28, 2020 following a riot that had broken out
    (IRNA 4/5/2020). At the time, Saqqez prison was one of many across the
    country experiencing acute prisoner unrest in response to overcrowding and
    inadequate safety protocols during the Covid-19 pandemic (ABC 4/21/2020).
    Kurdistan Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor Mohammad Jabbari refuted
    claims that the escape was related to concerns over Covid-19, but failed
    to provide further explanation. (IRNA 4/5/2020) Shortly after the escape,
    Mr. Sa'idpur was re-arrested and exiled to Sanandaj prison (HRANA
    4/19/2020). Trial Judge Vefayan of Branch 1 of Kurdistan Criminal Court
    tried and sentenced Mr. Sa'idpur on October 23, 2018. The ruling was
    appealed to the Supreme Court in February of 2019 (HRANA 4/19/2020).
    Charges According to an informed source, Mr. Sa'idpur was charged with
    alcohol consumption and intentional murder (HRANA 4/21/2020). Evidence of
    guilt According to Amnesty International, the Legal Medicine Organization
    of Iran determined that Mr. Sa'idpur had attained mental maturity at the
    time of the crime and could distinguish between right and wrong. It was
    reported that these findings were initially issued by experts in Kurdistan
    and later affirmed experts by Kermanshah (HRANA 04/21/2020). Defense
    According to Mr. Sa'idpur s family members, he was exactly 17 years, 10
    months, and 25 days old at the time of the crime. The fact that he was a
    minor was affirmed in reports that quoted another informed source (HRANA
    12/6/2018). Under Article 91 of the Islamic Penal code, in force since
    2013, judges can spare minor defendants who wo
