    Mr. Navid Afkari, Greco-Roman wrestling champion: If we have kept silent
    thus far, it was in the hopes that justice would prevail, and nothing
    else. But from this moment on, my family and I need help. I am not talking
    only to Iran [and Iranians]; I m addressing any human being that talks of
    humanity and has a shred of decency and integrity: Your silence is
    equivalent to supporting oppression and the oppressors. News and
