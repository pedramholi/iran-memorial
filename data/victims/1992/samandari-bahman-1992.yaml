    Information about the execution of Mr. Bahman Samandari, son of Azizollah
    and Behyieh, was obtained from United Nations Reports on the human rights
    situation in Iran dated January 28, 1993 (Reynaldo Galindo Pohl), January
    25, 1988, November 30, 1992 and November 30, 1991. Additional information
    was obtained from Keyhan-e Havaei (June 8th, 1992), Kayhan London (16
    April 1992), Andaleeb Magazine (January 21, 2022). Furthermore,
    information was acquired from various documents published in the Archives
    of Baha i Persecution in Iran, including a brief biography, an excerpt of
    his Death Certificate from the National Organization for Civil
    Registration (March 17, 1992), a copy of his death certificate from the
    Shemiran Branch of the National Organization for Civil Registration (NCR)
    released on December 3, 2008, a letter from his wife to the Head of the
    Supreme Judicial Council, Mr. Yazdi (May 5th, 1992), and a feature article
    from IranWire (April 22nd, 2022). Mr. Samandari is also one of the 206
    Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report documents the persecution of the
    members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is
    killed since 1978. Mr. Bahman Samandari was born on November 8th 1939 in
    Karaj, Iran (Andaleeb Magazine January 21, 2022). He completed his
    highschool education in Tehran before migrating to Turkey in 1955 and
    obtaining a Bachelor of Economics from Ankara University. He then returned
    to Iran and got married to Rosa Mahbubi in 1971 and had two children. Mr.
    Samandari owned a successful travel agency for a number of years, but this
    business was amongst the masses of property confiscated from Baha i s
    following the 1979 revolution (IranWire April 22nd, 2022). After the
    confiscation, Mr. Samandari worked at a textile factory (Kayhan, April
    16th, 1992). Mr. Samandari served the Baha i community in a variety of
    ways. He served on the Executive Board of the University of Indiana s
    project that offered correspondence courses for Baha i students in Iran,
    after Baha is were systematically purged from Iran academia following the
    Cultural Revolution (IranWire). [1] Mr. Samandari was also a member of
    Yaran, an informal administrative group for the affairs of the Baha is,
    following the dibandment of Spiritual Assemblies in Iran (ABC, IranWire).
    Mr. Samandari was first arrested on October 21st, 1987, during a Yaran
    meeting with four other Baha is, without an arrest warrant (IranWire) and
    reportedly charged because of membership in the Baha i community (UN
    Report January 28, 1993). He was kept in solitary confinement for 57 days
    and released on October 21st, 1987 (IranWire, ABPI, Andaleeb). Following
    the arrest, the title of his home and bail payment was turned over to the
    authorities and he was required to report to the Revolutionary Guard
    headquarters at regular intervals (UN Report January 28, 1993). The
    Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran addressed the charges for this
    arrest in a published letter as having been spying. The letter also stated
    that he was released because of his repentance for [...] conduct and the
    lightness of his charges (UN Report 1993). In her letter to the Head of
    the Supreme Judicial Council, Mr. Samandari s wife wrote that he was the
    most beloved person in the life of his wife and two children (ABPI, Rosa
    Mahbubi, May 5th, 1992). The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the
    members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious
    minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(2)- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.(3) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the
    time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified
    and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various spee
