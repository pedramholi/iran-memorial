    Mr. Qorbani was a political refugee in France and was in charge of
    assisting Iranian refugees in Turkey News of Mr. Ali Akbar Qorbani s
    assassination was published on the Mojahedeen Khalq Organization s website
    (February 12, 2007); United Nations Human Rights Commission s Report
    (March 30, 1993); Turkey s Hurriet newspaper (July 17, 1998); Turkey s
    Milliet newspaper (May 10, 2000); Amnesty International s Report
    (March-April 1994); and an article published by Brigham Young University
    in the United States (2013-14). Additional information about this case was
    obtained from Turkey s Milliet newspaper website (May 9, 2000). Mr.
    Qorbani, with the assumed name Mansur Amini (2013-14 Article), was 38
    years old and born in the town of Meshkinshahr in Ardebil Province. He had
    studied basic sciences at Istanbul s Technical University. (Mojahedeen
    Khalq Organization, February 12, 2007). Mr. Qorbani was a political
    refugee in France and an active member of the Mojahedeen Khalq
    Organization in Turkey. He was in charge of assisting Iranian refugees in
    Turkey. (United Nations Human Rights Commission s Report, March 30, 1993).
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and to recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. ** Threats against Mr. Qorbani, and His Death Mr. Ali Akbar
    Qorbani was kidnapped in Istanbul s Sisli district at 11:40 on August 5,
    1992, and was subsequently tortured and killed. (Mojahedeen Khalq
    Organization, February 12, 2007; United Nations Human Rights Commission s
    Report, March 30, 1993). According to available information, two Turkish
    individuals dressed in police uniforms, had shown Mr. Qorbani their
    identification cards as he was getting into his car, and had asked him to
    accompany them to the police precinct to answer a few questions. Mr.
    Qorbani, who had become suspicious of them, asked them a few questions, at
    which point the two individuals attacked and rendered him unconscious,
    using anesthetic products. They proceeded to take him to a rented villa
    behind the Penar Development, five kilometers (3 miles) from the town of
    Yalova on the route to the town of Karamursel. (Mojahedeen Khalq
    Organization, February 12, 2007). On June 11, 1992, the European
    Parliament issued a resolution in which it expressed concern about the
    fate of Mr. Qorbani, and asked the Turkish Government to prevent his
    transfer to Iran and to arrest the kidnappers. (United Nations Human
    Rights Commission s Report, March 30, 1993). After their arrest and in the
    course of police investigations, members of Turkey s Islamic Movement ***
    admitted to having met with the agents of Iran s Ministry of Information
    in March and April, 1993, in Istanbul s Kadikoy district (Hurriet
    newspaper, July 17, 1998), kidnapping Mr. Qorbani, as instructed by Iran s
    Ministry of Information, and turning him along with a suitcase to Iran s
    Ministry of Information agents in a rental villa in the town of Yalova, in
    exchange for eighty thousand U.S. Dollars. (Milliet newspaper, May 10,
    2000). At the request of Iran s Ministry of Information agents, Turkey s
    Islamic Movement wanted to hire a postman to [wiretap and] listen in on
    phone conversations of opponents of the Islamic Republic of Iran,
    including Mr. Qorbani. Iranian security agents did not agree to the
    postman s demand for payment of ten thousand Dollars for eavesdropping on
    each individual, and the project was halted. (Milliet newspaper, May 10,
    2000). The members of this group admitted that the Ministry of Information
    agents killed Mr.
