    poet, radio and television producer, singer, television and radio host,
    songwriter, composer, actor, and political activist. He was one of the
    most famous showmen in Iran before the 1979 revolution and hosted the
    popular program "Silver Carnation" on National Iranian Television Channel
    One for years. According to available information, Mr. Farokhzad was born
    in Tehran on October 9, 1936. He was the fourth child of his family. His
    father was a military officer and his sister, Forugh Farokhzad, was a
    well-known Iranian poet who died in a car accident in 1966. He studied at
    Razi Elementary School and Darolfonun High School, graduating with a
    diploma in literature. After being exempted from military service in 1958,
    he went to Germany and studied political science in Munich. He earned a
    master's degree in contemporary history and a doctorate in political law.
    Mr. Farokhzad has been married twice. His first marriage, in Germany in
    1962, resulted in two children, one of whom, a daughter, died in infancy.
    He returned to Iran with his wife and son on January 25, 1969 (Ghadimiha
    website). Ten years later, his wife and son returned to Germany after Mr.
    Farokhzad and his wife divorced. His second marriage, in 1973, also ended
    in divorce after a few months. Mr. Farokhzad's literary and artistic
    activities were successful in Germany, as well as in Iran. In 1963, he
    published a poetry book in German entitled "Andere Jahreszeit", which won
    the Berlin Literature Prize. He was also a member of the Munich Youth
    Literature Academy. In 1966, he began collaborating with Munich Radio and
    Television, producing several radio programs and creating a film series
    called "Alpine Roads. In 1967, he composed modern music inspired by
    Iranian folk music, which took him to the Innsbruck Music Festival in
    Austria, where he won the first prize. He was the editor of the children's
    program on Radio Iran for three years before he was fired. Mr. Farokhzad
    wrote about it: "After three years, I was dismissed from Radio Iran
    without any explanation, because I had known the family of Hamid Ashraf
    (one of the leaders of the Organization of the People's Fada'i Guerrillas
    of Iran) since childhood and had visited their home with a bouquet of
    roses after the Siahkal* incident." He continued: "I have been summoned
    several times by the security officials due to my love for freedom and
    being free!!! They raided my house twice, tied my hands and eyes and took
    me to solitary confinement (Anti-Sabotage Committee), which was located
    behind the Shahrbani building. They treated me in a way that I will never
    forget for the rest of my life. (Ettelaat Newspaper - November 4, 1978)
    Mr. Farokhzad was ahead of his time as an artist before and after the
    Islamic revolution. His behavior was different from the intellectual and
    artistic men of his time. He danced on stage and kissed women's hands as a
    sign of respect. In his show "Silver Carnation", he addressed cultural and
    social issues in a humorous format, mentioned children with disabilities,
    and invited and appreciated hard working members of society such as street
    sweepers, postmen, policemen, and bus drivers. (Mehdi Nejad Farahani's
    blog) Another issue was the controversy over his homosexuality, which
    continued after his death. Esfandiar Monfaredz
