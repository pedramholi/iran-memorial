    Mr. Nuri: "I will not leave Kurdistan so long as there is a tree standing
    here, unless they spill my blood." Information regarding the extrajudicial
    killing of Mr. Mohammad Nazar Nuri, also known as Mameh Nazar ( Uncle
    Nazar ), son of Abdolmohammad and Jeiran, was obtained through an
    interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with his brother
    (March 15, and 29, 2022). Additional information about this case was
    obtained through an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center with one of his friends (February 21, 2022), the book Siavoshan:
    Remembrance of the Ranjbaran Party of Iran s Martyrs (Winter 2000), and
    Iran Emrooz website (February 25, 2022). Mr. Nuri, an ethnic Kurd, 43
    years old, and follower of the Yarsan faith*, was born in a family of
    farmers in the village of Bizmirabad in Sar-e Pol-e Zahab County in
    Kermanshah Province. He was married and had seven children, and resided in
    the town of Arbat in Iraqi Kurdistan s Sulaymaniyah Province. He [had no
    formal education and] could just read and write. (Boroumand Center
    interview, March 15, 2022). According to Mr. Nuri s friend, after the
    Islamic Revolution, followers of the Yarsan faith, including Mr. Nuri s
    family, came under tremendous pressure from government forces. That was
    why Mr. Nuri and his family were opponents of the Islamic Republic and
    several members of his family, including his brother and uncle (his father
    s brother) were summarily executed. After the Revolution, Mr. Nuri was
    active for a time with the formation of armed forces for the defense of
    the Yarsan followers and combating the Iranian regime. He played an active
    role in arming Yarsan followers against the regime by importing weapons
    from Iraq with two other individuals into the Dalahoe region, most of
    whose residents are followers of the Yarsan faith. (Boroumand Center
    interview, February 21, 2022). With the onset of armed conflict between
    the Iranian government and Iranian Kurdish parties, Mr. Nuri started to
    work with these parties as a guide because of his familiarity with
    Kermanshah s Dalahoe region especially with the Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan, and in order to clean up mine fields in those regions.
    (Boroumand Center interview, March 15, 2022). Mr. Nuri and his family
    lived in a border region [in Iran] and were forced to leave at the start
    of the Iran-Iraq war and take up residence at the Iranian Kurdish refugees
    camp in Qurtu, located Iraqi Kurdistan s Garmian region. (Boroumand Center
    interview, March 15, 2022). Mr. Nuri joined the Ahl-e Haq Resistance
    Movement** in 1981 and was active as the Movement s military forces
    commander in regions in Kermanshah Province where Ahl-e Haq followers
    lived. After the dissolution of the Movement in 1985, he and his family
    moved to the Doreh region of the city of Kalar in Iraqi Kurdistan. That
    same year, he and two of his brothers joined the Ranjbaran Party of
    Iran*** after he was introduced to the Party by one of his friends.
    Simultaneous with his Party activities, he engaged in the sale and
    purchase of weapons in order to make a living. (Boroumand Center
    interview, March 15, 2022). Mr. Nuri was one of the Ranjbaran Party s
    military commanders and had returned to Iran along with the Party s
    political and military groups on multiple occasions in order to carry out
    operations. (The book Siavoshan: Remembrance of the Ranjbaran Party of
    Iran s Martyrs , Winter 2000). According to his brother, after the
    Ranjbaran Party halted its activities in Iraqi Kurdistan in 1991, Mr. Nuri
    refused his friends offer to emigrate to Europe and stated: I will not
    leave Kurdistan so long as there is a tree standing here, unless they
    spill my blood. He was extremely happy when Iraqi Kurdistan gained
    autonomy in 1991, and was very optimistic about the struggles of Kurdish
    parties in Iranian Kurdistan. (Boroumand Center interview, March 15,
    2022). According to Mr. Nuri s brother, he was a courageous,
    freedom-loving, humble, simple, and democratic human being, who hoped to
    see a free Kurdistan with its flag raised high before his death .
    (Boroumand Center interview, March 15, 2022). According to Mr. Nuri s
    friend, he was a smart, brave, sociable, generous, and honest individual
    who believed very strongly in the Yarsan faith . (Boroumand Center
    interview, February 21, 2022). Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history
    of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the
    1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the
    country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since
    then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has
    so far identified over 540 killings outside I
