    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Sadeqi, along with three other
    individuals*, was reported by the Kayhan newspaper on June 10, 1992.
    Information regarding the execution of Mr. Sadeqi was also published in a
    report by the Special Representative of the United Nations Commission on
    Human Rights published on January 28, 1993. The report is entitled Final
    Report on the Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran by
    the Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights, Mr. Reynaldo
    Galindo Pohl, pursuant to Commission resolution 1992/67 of 4 March 1992
    (E/CN.4/1993/41). The report contains a letter from the Permanent
    Representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations dated
    November 24, 1992 regarding the execution of Mr. Sadeqi and the other
    three individuals. 1992 Protests in Mashhad The executions of Mashhad, and
    the May shantytown rioting that led to it, were also reported by human
    rights organizations such as Amnesty International (June 15, 1992) and the
    Lawyers Committee for Human Rights (The Justice System of the Islamic
    Republic, May 1993). The Christian Science Monitor of June 2, 1992
    described the rioting based on an Associated Press report. Additional
    information was provided to the Boroumand Foundation by a person who
    resided in Mashhad in 1992. In the spring of 1992, demonstrators in
    several Iranian cities including Shiraz, Arak, and Mashhad, protested
    following incidents opposing authorities by angry residents. These
    protests, during which several people were killed, led to hundreds of
    arrests and the execution of at least 8 demonstrators. The May 30 Mashhad
    rioting, announced by Tehran Radio, was sparked by the municipal
    authorities attempts to destroy illegally-constructed dwellings and
    forcibly evict their inhabitants. According to the Associated Press, the
    government had sent bulldozers to raze squatters dwellings that house[d]
    tens of thousands of workers who worked in nearby factories . Angry
    shantytown residents demonstrated in the city, setting fire to and
    destroying government buildings. A resident of Mashhad remembers a
    neighbor who returned to their neighborhood running away from the scene of
    the riots where security forces were shooting at the crowd. The UN Special
    Rapporteur referred to a report according to which, On 30 May 1992, during
    incidents and demonstrations at Mashhad, Khorasan Province, members of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of the Pasdaran and other security
    forces responded with excessive force and opened fire indiscriminately on
    demonstrators . Amnesty International also stated that several people were
    reportedly killed during the rioting and 300 hundred were arrested. Less
    than two weeks after the Mashhad riots, Amnesty International reported
    that 4 individuals, arrested in connection with the May 30th riots, were
    sentenced to death and executed. The report, which was based on a June 10
    announcement by Tehran radio, stated that a number of people had been
    sentenced to long-term imprisonment and flogging while others awaited
    trial. Amnesty also mentioned unconfirmed reports indicating that the true
    number of executions may have been considerably higher. Public statements
    by Iranian judicial and religious authorities following these events
    indicate a deliberate use of lethal force to control demonstrators. On
    June 25, the semi-official Newspaper Kayhan quoted the recommendations to
    the military forces by a high ranking cleric, Hojatoleslam Ha eri, the
    Friday Prayer Leader in Shiraz: You must not be patient with the enemies,
    you must shoot them immediately.... Islamic verdicts are clear; there is
    no need for trials and investigations. I told the Prosecutor the same
    night, after the incident, that it is better to execute a few of them
    immediately, in different areas of the city, than to execute ten of them
    tomorrow (Lawyers Committee report). The official news agency IRNA
    reported the orders of the higher authority: Seek out troublemakers and
    destroy them like weeds (Lawyers Committee report). Amnesty International
    refers to a statement of the Head of Judiciary, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi,
    (quoted by Reuters on 1 June 1992) announcing an extraordinary procedure
    so that swift and decisive justice would be meted out to rioters... in
    Mashhad. Human rights organizations condemned the Iranian government s
    heavy-handed treatment of the protesters and its disregard for
    internationally recognized standards of fairness in the judicial process
    that led to the execution of several people ten days after the riots. The
    Lawyers Committee for Human Rights noted that: Independent citizens feel
    concerned because they are unable to foresee the reactions of the
    authorities to situations of tension or public disturbance. The recent
    case of the demonstrations in Mashad, Shiraz and other cities has been
    eloquent in this respect. What began as a municipal incident blew up into
    a major event because the authorities were not prepared to restore order
