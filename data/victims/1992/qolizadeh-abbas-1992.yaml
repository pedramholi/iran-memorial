    Mr. Abbas Qolizadeh was a major in the Imperial Iranian Army. Information
    regarding the life and extrajudicial execution of Mr. Abbas Qolizadeh was
    taken from Turkish newspapers including Cumhuriyet Newspaper (26 Sep 1996,
    9 May 2000), The website of Hurriyet Newspaper (17 July 1998), Milliyet
    Newspaper (8 and 9 May 2000) and the book "Who killed Ugur Mumcu" (written
    by Adnan Gerger, Imge Publication, 2011). Additional information was taken
    from the indictment issued against the Tawheed-Salam groups and the Quds
    Force (July and August 2000), The verdict of the branch 11 of Ankara
    Serious Crimes Court (28 July 2005), Cumhuriyet newspaper (29 Dec 1992, 12
    and 15 Dec 1993) and other sources*. Mr. Abbas Qolizadeh served as a major
    in the Iranian Imperial Army and worked as a special bodyguard. He was
    married and had four children. In 1982-1983, Mr. Qolizadeh sought refuge
    in Turkey with his family, settling in Istanbul. (Cumhuriyet Newspaper,
    December 29, 1992). After leaving Iran, Mr. Qolizadeh became a member of
    the Derafsh-e Kaviani Organization ( The Flag for Freedom of Iran ),
    assuming a role as an official overseeing the members and political
    activists associated with this organization in Turkey. (Interview with
    Manouchehr Ganji, no date). Mr. Qolizadeh was the bodyguard of Mr.
    Ata'ollah By Ahmadi, who was one of the key members of the Derafsh-e
    Kaviani organization. (From the book 'Defying the Iranian Revolution: From
    a Minister to the Shah to a Leader of Resistance', 2002, page 203).
    Derafsh-e Kaviani Organization The Derafsh-e Kaviani Organization was a
    constitutionalist group opposing the government of the Islamic Republic of
    Iran. It was established in Paris in 1987 by Manouchehr Ganji, who served
    as the Minister of Education in the cabinets of Amir Abbas Hoveyda and
    Jafar Sharif Emami. Concurrently with its inception, this organization
    initiated a radio station named Iran s Derafsh-e Kaviani in Cairo, Egypt.
    The station broadcasted programs in Farsi for four hours daily. The
    organization operated against the government of the Islamic Republic of
    Iran by distributing audio and video cassettes and broadcasting the
    Derafsh-e Kaviani radio within Iran. In 1998, the Derafsh-e Kaviani
    organization altered its name to the 'Organization of Human Rights and
    Fundamental Freedoms for Iran'. Background on Turkish Islamic groups
    involved in extrajudicial executions of Iranian dissidents After the
    famous Turkish journalist Ugur Mumcu was assassinated, having authored an
    article on Islamic extremist groups in Turkey, implicating their
    involvement in the targeted killings of Iranian dissidents with
    substantial support from the Iranian government, the Turkish authorities
    arrested several members of these extremist Islamic groups in a villa in
    the Beykoz district of Istanbul on January 17, 2000. During the trial
    proceedings involving these individuals, extensive evidence, documents
    obtained from them, and their confessions underscore the involvement and
    actions of security and diplomatic agents associated with the Iranian
    government in abducting and executing Iranian government opponents. During
    the 1980s and 1990s, these individuals undertook multiple journeys to Iran
    for military training. The court ruling highlights numerous terrorist
    operations and establishes the link between the defendants and Iran's
    security forces. It also discusses Iran's financial, intelligence, and
    facilitation support to the defendants for the assassination of Turkish
    intellectuals and Iranian opponents of the Iranian government in Turkey.
    In the cited vote, the names of Iranian embassy employees involved
    directly and indirectly in the assassinations were mentioned. (Extracted
    from the indictment issued by branch 11 of the Turkish Serious Crimes
    Court and the court's decision in July 2005.) Background of Extrajudicial
    Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has
    a long history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the
    world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and
    outside the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing
    a large number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable.
    The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is
    not clear; however, these murders began in February 1979 and have
    continued since then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran
    attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been
    assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
    in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France,
    Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in
    Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases,
    there has not been much published, and local authorities have not issued
    arres
