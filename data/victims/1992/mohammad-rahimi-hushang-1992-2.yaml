    He thought of leaving Iran, though opportunities didn t develop easily. He
    taught on his own, keeping in mind a move to the Mojahedin Khalq Ashraf
    camp in Iraq. Information about Mr. Hushang Mohammad-Rahimi, son of Jalil,
    was taken from an interview with a relative (London, February 7, 2011).
    Mr. Mohammad-Rahimi was born into a politically active family. He studied
    architecture in Tehran s Polytechnic University (renamed Amir Kabir
    University of Technology). After the 1979 revolution, he became a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)* and started
    political activism in the Muslim Student Association of Polytechnic
    University, which was affiliated with the MKO. As the tensions between the
    MKO and the newly formed government of the Islamic Republic increased, Mr.
    Mohammad-Rahimi was arrested by agents of the regime in his university s
    dormitory in 1980. He was released soon after. As political oppression
    entered a new phase in June 1981, agents of the state attacked the
    Mohammad-Rahimi house on Adib Street, on July 29, 1981. They arrested
    Hushang, his brother Ebrahim, his sister Soheila, as well as their
    parents. His other sister Mehrangiz, another brother Aziz, and his nephew,
    15-year-old Hossein Majidi, were also arrested in 1981. Aziz was executed
    less than a month after his arrest. Hossein Majidi died due to torture in
    1981. Soheila and Mahrangiz were executed during the massacre of political
    prisoners in 1988. Ebrahim and Hushang were both condemned to ten years in
    prison and were released in 1991. The stories of Soheila, Mehrangiz, Aziz,
    and Hossein are documented in Omid. Those close to Mr. Hushang
    Mohammad-Rahimi remember him as a quiet, patient, and calm young man. He
    loved hiking and playing soccer. He helped his cellmates and taught them
    math in prison. According to the interviewee, after his release, he wanted
    to finish studying architecture, but the admission office of the
    Polytechnic University denied him admission because of his political
    background and banned him from studying. He searched for a job. But he
    continued to face obstacles. For example, state institutions rejected his
    applications because of his political background, and private institutions
    expressed concern that hiring him might lead to problems for their
    institutions and therefore refused to hire him. Consequently, Mr.
    Mohammad-Rahimi started to tutor math, Arabic, and English. Before he
    disappeared, he had told the interviewee that he intended to flee Iran and
    go to the MKO Ashraf camp in Iraq. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Mohammad-Rahimi was secretly arrested and detained. In the summer of 1992,
    one day he left the house and never returned. His relatives believe that
    he was kidnapped by the agents of the Ministry of Intelligence. His family
    went to the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office of Tehran Province.
    The officials not only denied the arrest of Mr. Hushang Mohammad-Rahimi,
    but also demanded that his family surrender him to the authorities. Former
    political prisoners were required to periodically report their whereabouts
    and circumstances to security officials. According to the interviewee,
    Three or four weeks after Hushang s disappearance, a former political
    prisoner who knew him, indirectly informed us that he saw Hushang at the
    Prosecutor s Office of Tehran Province, wearing prison clothes. Just like
    Hushang, this former political prisoner was required to report to the
    prosecution office. This was the only news that we had about Hushang after
    he disappeared. Trial There is no information on whether there was a trial
    for Mr. Mohammad-Rahimi. Since his arrest was never officially announced,
    there is no information on the process that led to his death. Charges The
    charge brought against the defendant is not known. His relatives believe
    that his plan to flee Iran and go to the MKO Ashraf camp was the main
    reason for his arrest. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohammad-Rahimi s
    defense. But the interviewee states: After ten years of imprisonment, all
    doors were closed for him. Overall, his life had become impossible.
    Whatever he wanted to do his past haunted him. He was really tired of the
    constant pressure and wanted to leave Iran and go to Ashraf. It is worth
    noting that in spite of the armed struggle announcement by the MKO on June
    20, 1981, many sympathizers of the organization had no military training,
    were not armed, and did not participate in armed conflict. Mr.
    Mohammad-Rahimi s relatives emphasize that his activities were only
    political and he was never involved in any armed action or training.
    Judgment There is no information on the verdict leading to this execution.
    However, security authorities unofficially informed Mr. Mohammad-Rahimi s
    relatives of his execution. After the fall of Saddam Hussein s government
    in Iraq, some relatives went to Iraq to visit
