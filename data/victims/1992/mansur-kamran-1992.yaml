    Mr. Mansur believed in organized party work and had written a number of
    articles expounding guerilla warfare. He was a member of Ettehadieh
    Communist-haye Iran ( Iran Communists Union ) also known as Sarbedaran,
    and played an integral part in its political and ideological overhaul and
    reconstruction after the severe repression of its members in Iran in 1981.
    Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Kamran Mansur (Kak
    Manuchehr Hosseini) was obtained from interviews conducted by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with a fellow member of Mr. Mansur s party in
    Iraqi Kurdistan (September 21, 2021) and with a person who knew Mr. Mansur
    (September 18, 2021). News of this murder was also published in Haghighat
    Publication, news arm of Ettehadieh Communist-haye Iran ( Iran Communists
    Union ) Sarbedaran, special edition dedicated to the killing of Mr. Mansur
    (July-August, 1992), and in an Iran Documents Center report
    (August-September, 2008). Additional information about this killing was
    obtained from the Communist Party of Iran website (March 17, 2019); Fa
    ezun website (January 24, 2018); Brigham Young University archives (March
    12, 2013); IRNA News Agency (August 8, 2019); and Boroumand Center
    research. Mr. Mansur was born in 1950-51, in a well-to-do family in
    Tehran. He graduated with a degree in Agriculture from Shiraz University
    and obtained a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from a university in England.
    He became concerned and sensitized about social inequalities and political
    issues during his time as a student at Shiraz University and became
    student activist. (Haghighat publication, July-August 1992; the Communist
    Party of Iran website). When studying in England, he was a follower of the
    Ettehadieh Communist-haye Iran ( Iran Communists Union ) (also called
    Sarbedaran), and joined the Ehia Students Confederation, a faction that
    had split from the Iranian Students Confederation, National Union, that
    was affiliated with the Communist Revolutionary Organization. (Boroumand
    Center interview with a fellow member of Mr. Mansur s party, September 21,
    2021). He went back to Iran after the 1979 Revolution, and returned to
    England a short while later. In the winter of 1981, he played an integral
    part in the establishment of the Students Revolutionary Masses
    Organization (SETAD), a division of the Iran Communists Union, the goal of
    which was to organize youth activities, and became its secretary.
    (Haghighat publication, July-August 1992; the Communist Party of Iran
    website). In February 1982, military clashes occurred between Sarbedaran
    members and government forces in the city of Amol [in Mazandaran Province]
    which led to the arrest, execution, and repression of the group inside
    Iran, and caused internal conflict in the Ettehadieh Communist-haye Iran
    (Communists Union). Mr. Mansur, at that time, he played an effective role
    in the Organization s political and ideological overhaul and
    reconstruction. Mr. Mansur believed in organized party work and played an
    important role in establishing the students' SETAD in various countries.
    He would write articles expounding the perspectives of the Ettehadieh
    Communist-haye Iran, the importance of carrying on the fight, necessity of
    reconstruction of the organization, and the strategies and tactics of
    armed struggle. One of the subjects about which he wrote regularly was
    surrounding and laying siege to cities by [first using] villages . He had
    written: We will start with villages because Erteja ( archaic and outdated
    ; here referring to the Islamic republic regime) is concentrated in towns
    and cities, and the probability of us being repressed in villages is
    lower, and we can rely on the village masses for a revolutionary war. We
    must quickly create partisan groups, free various regions, and expand our
    forces. Relying on armed fighting, we can and we must recruit activists
    and pioneers in towns near a particular region, that is, from among urban
    masses, especially the proletariat and those who live on the fringes, who
    are in contact with the farmers themselves. (Haghighat publication,
    July-August 1992). Between 1982 and 1984, Mr. Mansur, along with other
    members of the SETAD, actively participated in protest demonstrations and
    assemblies held against the Islamic Republic in England, including the
    demonstrations in support of political prisoners in the summer of 1984. He
    was in charge of the attack and occupation of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    Airline in London on November 8, 1984, protesting the repression of Kurds
    and forced migration . (Haghighat publication, July-August 1992; Faezoon
    website). After the Ettehadieh Communist-haye Iran s call for the
    resumption of armed struggle in the North in 1985, Mr. Mansur, as an
    official member of the party, went to Iraqi Kurdistan and to various
    villages and towns in Soleimanieh Province, finally settling in the town
    of Ranieh. He was in charge of the Ettehadieh Communist-haye Iran s
    Kurdistan Committee and was director of "Seday-e
