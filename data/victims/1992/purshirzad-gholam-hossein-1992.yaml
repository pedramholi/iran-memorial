    Gholam Hossein Purshirzad was a 43-year-old technician with the Mashhad
    Railway Company. He was a kind and pious man not affiliated with any group
    or organization. News of the execution of Mr. Gholam Hossein Purshirzad,
    along with three other individuals*, was reported by the Kayhan newspaper
    on June 10, 1992. Further information regarding the execution is taken
    from statements by individuals close to Mr. Purshirzad with knowledge of
    the case, submitted to ABF by way of an online electronic form in
    July-August 2016. Additional information was made available in a report by
    the Special Representative of the United Nations Commission on Human
    Rights published on January 28, 1993. The report is entitled Final Report
    on the Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran by the
    Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights, Mr. Reynaldo
    Galindo Pohl, pursuant to Commission resolution 1992/67 of 4 March 1992
    (E/CN.4/1993/41). The report contains a letter from the Permanent
    Representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations dated
    November 24, 1992 regarding the execution of Mr. Gholam Hossein Purshirzad
    and three other individuals. According to those who knew him, he was a
    kind and pious man not affiliated with any group or organization. Mr.
    Gholam Hossein Purshirzad, son of Ali Asghar, was born in Yazd in
    1949/1950. He was a diesel repair technician employed by the Mashhad
    Railway Company and was not affiliated with any group or political party.
    He was a Shia Muslim, married, and the father of eight children. According
    to those near him, he was a pious, kind, and likeable man who never
    troubled others and won over everyone with his positive qualities. Mr.
    Purshirzad s case relates to civil disturbances which took place in
    Mashhad in the spring of 1992. Background The executions in Mashhad, and
    the May shantytown protests that led to them, were also reported by human
    rights organizations such as Amnesty International (June 15, 1992) and the
    Lawyers Committee for Human Rights ( The Justice System of the Islamic
    Republic, May 1993). The Christian Science Monitor described the unrest
    based on an Associated Press report on June 2, 1992. Additional
    information was provided to the Boroumand Foundation by a person who
    resided in Mashhad in 1992. In the spring of 1992, demonstrators in
    several Iranian cities including Shiraz, Arak, and Mashhad, protested
    following official actions which provoked citizens anger. These protests,
    during which several people were killed, led to hundreds of arrests and
    the execution of at least 8 demonstrators. The May 30 Mashhad unrest,
    announced by Tehran Radio, was sparked by the municipal authorities
    attempts to destroy illegally-constructed dwellings and forcibly evict
    their inhabitants. According to the Associated Press, the government had
    sent bulldozers to raze squatter dwellings that house[d] tens of thousands
    of workers who worked in nearby factories. Angry shantytown residents
    demonstrated in the city, setting fire to and destroying government
    buildings. The UN Special Rapporteur referred to a report according to
    which: On 30 May 1992, during incidents and demonstrations at Mashhad,
    Khorasan Province, members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of
    the Pasdaran and other security forces responded with excessive force and
    opened fire indiscriminately on demonstrators . Amnesty International also
    stated that several people were reportedly killed during the protest and
    300 hundred were arrested. A resident of Mashhad testified in an interview
    with Boroumand Foundation that he had seen a neighbor fleeing the scene of
    the protests and that the neighbor had reported the fact that security
    forces were shooting at the crowd. Less than two weeks after the Mashhad
    unrest, Amnesty International reported that 4 individuals arrested in
    connection with the May 30th protests, were sentenced to death and
    executed. The report, which was based on a June 10 announcement by Tehran
    radio, stated that a number of people had been sentenced to long-term
    imprisonment and flogging while others awaited trial. Amnesty also
    mentioned unconfirmed reports indicating that the true number of
    executions may have been considerably higher. Public statements by Iranian
    judicial and religious authorities following these events indicate a
    deliberate use of lethal force to control demonstrators. On June 25, the
    semi-official newspaper Kayhan quoted the recommendations to the military
    forces by a high ranking cleric, Hojatoleslam Ha eri, the Friday Prayer
    Leader in Shiraz: You must not be patient with the enemies, you must shoot
    them immediately. ... Islamic verdicts are clear; there is no need for
    trials and investigations. I told the Prosecutor the same night, after the
    incident, that it is better to execute a few of them immediately, in
    different areas of the city, than to execute ten of them tomorrow (Lawyers
    Committee report). The official news agency IRNA reported the order
