    Mr. Motahhari was in prison from 1982 until a few months after the
    killings of Summer 1988. After being released from prison, he remained a
    supporter of the People s Mojahedin Organization and he stayed in touch
    with them. Information about the abduction and extrajudicial execution of
    Mr. Ahmad Reza Mohammadi Motahhari has been obtained from a conversation
    with Mr. Iraj Mesdaqi, who was Mr. Motahhari s cellmate and his friend
    (September 15, 2022). News of this killing has also been published on the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization website (December 26, 2016). Additional
    information on this case has been collected from material published on
    Freedom of Expression website (August 17, 2019), People s Mojahedin
    Organization Martyrs Biography (December 17, 2021), Pajhwok of Iran
    website (December 2014), and Pajvak-e Iran website (October 2009). Mr.
    Motahari was born in 1958 and he was a supporter of the People s Mojahedin
    Organization of Iran (Boroumand Center interview, September 15, 2022; MKO,
    November 23, 2021). He was married and he had three children. Mr.
    Motahhari was arrested in 1982 and he was released from prison in January
    1989. After he was released, he remained in contact with the MKO
    (Boroumand Center interview, September 15, 2022; Pajhwok of Iran website,
    December 2014). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to the split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977.
    In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to reorganize the MKO and
    recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution
    and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. (1) Background of Extrajudicial
    Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has
    a long history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the
    world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and
    outside the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing
    a large number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable.
    The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is
    not clear; however, these murders began in February 1979 and have
    continued since then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran
    attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been
    assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
    in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France,
    Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in
    Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases,
    there has not been much published, and local authorities have not issued
    arrest warrants. But documentation, evidence, and traces obtained through
    investigations conducted by local police and judicial authorities confirm
    the theory of state committed crimes. In some instances, these
    investigations have resulted in the expulsion or arrest of Iranian
    diplomats. In a few cases outside Iran, the perpetrators of these murders
    have been arrested and put on trial. The evidence presented revealed the
    defendants connection to Iran s government institutions, and an arrest
    warrant has been issued for Iran s Minister of Information. The manner in
    which these killings were organized and implemented in Iran and abroad is
    indicative of a single pattern which, according to Roland Chatelin, the
    Swiss prosecutor, contains common parameters and detailed planning. It can
    be ascertained from the similarities between these murders in different
    countries that the Iranian government is the principal entit
