    News of the execution of Mr. Jasem Delneshin, known as Molajasem Esma ili,
    along with three others, was published on the website of Peyke Iran on
    September 27, 2005, quoting the Organization for Defending Human Rights in
    Kurdistan. Additional information is taken from a letter written by Mr.
    Osman Mostafapur, Mr. Delneshin s casemate, to Mr. Ahmad Shaheed, United
    Nations Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Iran (The
    Campaign to Defend Political and Civil Prisoners, December 16, 2011), and
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation interview with a member of the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan based on the archive of this party.
    Mr. Jasem Delneshin, son of Fathollah, a single Kurd, was from the
    Varbolandi Village near Orumieh. He had a seminary education and was a
    Sunni cleric. According to a member of the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan, Mr. Delneshin joined the party in 1982 and was a military
    commander of the party in Orumieh and surrounding area. (ABF interview)
    The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with
    the objective to gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in north western of Iran.
    After the Revolution, conflicts between the new central Shiite government
    and the mainly Sunni Kurdistan, regarding the role of minorities in the
    drafting of the constitution, specification of Shiite as the official
    state religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in
    armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and the Peshmerga (the
    militia of the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, when
    people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime. On August
    19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan and
    declared it unofficial and illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke out
    and continued for several months in the region. By 1983, PDKI had lost
    much of its influence in the region. Various leaders of the PDKI have been
    assassinated. Arrest and detention According to the interviewee, while
    performing their organizational duties, the Revolutionary Guards attacked
    Mr. Delneshin and six other peshmarga of the PDKI in Orumieh District on
    July 14, 1991. (ABF interview) According to a member of this group, the
    Revolutionary Guards at the Asengran Targur area near Orumieh arrested Mr.
    Deleshin and three others; two others were killed. (The letter by Osman
    Mostafapur to Ahmad Shaeed, Campaign to Defend Political and Civil
    Prisoners) The circumstances of Mr. Delneshin s arrest and detention are
    unknown; however, according to his cellmate letter to Ahmad Shaheed, he
    was detained in solitary confinement by the Revolutionary Guards and the
    Intelligence Office in Orumieh for six months. On January 8, 1992, Mr.
    Delneshin was transferred to the Orumieh Central Prison and met his
    friends for the first time. He told his friends that he had been tortured
    physically and mentally and insulted by his interrogators for six months
    during which he had no visitation with his family or his attorney. (The
    letter by Osman Mostafapur to Ahmad Shaeed, Campaign to Defend Political
    and Civil Prisoners) Trial According to a defendant in this case, Mr.
    Delneshin and others were tried on January 25, 1992. No information is
    available on his trial. (The letter by Osman Mostafapur) Charges According
    to the Organization for Defending the Human Rights in Kurdistan, the
    charge against Mr. Delneshin had been cooperation with the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party of Iran . (Peyke Iran) The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Delneshin. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Delneshin s defense. According to a defendant in this
    case, the court did not allow defendants to select their attorneys and
    assigned them public defenders. (The letter by Osman Mostafapur) Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Jasem Delneshin and two other defendants in this
    case to death. According to a defendant, Mr. Delneshin was notified
    several months after the ruling was issued. He was executed at the Orumieh
    Central Prison in the summer of 1992. (The letter by Osman Mostafapur) Mr.
    Delneshin s body was not given to his family. (ABF interview)
