    Information about Mr. Mohammad Khalkhali Shandiz was gathered from an
    electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by his cellmate. Mr.
    Mohammad Khalkhali Shandiz is also listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were
    reported by the organization in a book titled Crime Against Humanity . He
    is also one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission
    Special Representative s Report, published on January 26, 1989. The
    Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information regarding the
    1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with witnesses and victims families, as
    well as from the Bidaran website. * Mr. Mohammad Khalkhali Shandiz was
    born in Shandiz, Mashhad, in 1959. He had an associate degree and was a
    sports coach. He was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and
    was active in the organization s Teachers Association in Mashhad. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. The organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    to be their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to a split between the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to reorganize the MKO and to recruit new members based on
    Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the
    Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini
    and supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene
    and infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, whether
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    s leaders. ** Arrest and Detention Mr. Mohammad Khalkhali Shandiz was
    arrested by the Revolutionary Guards in Mashhad and was transferred to the
    Guards Base at Malekabad Square in the summer of 1981. Since 1986, in
    spite of serving his sentence, he was still detained, like many other
    political prisoners whose sentences were completed. In 1987, he was
    transferred to the Qarantineh [Quarantine] Section that had worse
    conditions than regular prison. Trial Mr. Mohammad Khalkhali Shandiz was
    tried at the Revolutionary Court in Alamdasht, located in Kuhsangi Street
    in Mashhad, and was condemned to five years imprisonment. According to the
    electronic form, the judge was either Fallahian or Razini. No information
    is available on his second trial, resulting in his execution. According to
    the testimonies of some of the political prisoners who were tried during
    the executions of the summer of 1988 in some of the prisons, the trials
    took place in a room in the prison, after a few weeks of isolation, during
    which prisoners were deprived of visitation, television and radio
    broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and September, a three-member
    delegation composed of the public prosecutor, a religious judge, and a
    representative of the Ministry of Information who asked prisoners
    questions about their views of the Mojahedin, whether they would renounce
    their beliefs, and if they were ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin.
    Based on what the answers were, the prisoners would have been charged with
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion and anti-Islam, as well as having
    been associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups
    based near the borders and would be sentenced to death. The authorities
    never informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose, nor the serious
    implications of their responses. During the summer of 1988, according to
    survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or
    leftist groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to the Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they
    argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of
    their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to priso
