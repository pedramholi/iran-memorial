    The information about Mr. Abbas Ali Monshi Rudsari has been drawn from an
    interview with his wife. Mr. Monshi Rudsari was a member of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization (Majority branch) and a victim of the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims
    families, and witnesses memoirs. Mr. Monshi Rudsari began his political
    activities after the Revolution in the Pishgam student section of the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. He was a medical student in Esfahan
    University, expelled during the Cultural Revolution. After the
    universities were closed, Mr. Monshi Rudsari was in charge of the
    promotional section of the Fadaiyan Organization in Esfahan. In 1983, he
    migrated to Tehran, along with his wife and children, in order to continue
    his political activism. He worked in the publishing house of the
    Organization and his work included publishing and distributing leaflets.
    Mr. Monshi Rudsari married on May 4, 1983 and had two children. He was
    forgiving and intellectual, rational and calm. He had a positive influence
    on his family members, including his older siblings. His wife felt safe
    and serene when she was married to him. One of his brothers, Mr. Baqer
    Monshi Rudsari, was charged with sympathizing with the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization and executed in 1981. He was a 17 year old high school
    student at the time. The Cultural Revolution began after Ayatollah
    Khomeini gave a speech in March 1980 and ordered that universities be
    purged of all those who opposed his regime and be transformed into
    learning environments [as opposed to political forums] where an
    all-Islamic curriculum would be taught. The first wave of violence began
    on April 15, 1980 during a speech by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani [a member of
    the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister of Interior] at the
    University of Tabriz. Following the speech, students supporting the regime
    took control of the University s central building and demanded that the
    university be purged from pro-Shah elements and other sellouts. On April
    18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution issued a communiqu accusing
    political groups of converting higher education institutions into
    headquarters of discordant political activities and naming them as
    obstacles to the radical transformation of the universities. The communiqu
    gave these groups three days (Saturday April 19 to Monday April 21) to
    shut down their activities in the universities. The Council stressed that
    the decision included libraries along with activities related to arts and
    sports. Political groups, which recruited members and had strong support
    in the universities, refused to evacuate. Before the Council s deadline,
    serious clashes took place between leftist groups and Islamist
    Associations, in opposition to the Associations that were sometimes
    supported by security forces and paramilitary groups. These clashes, which
    peaked at the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in the death of
    several people and the wounding of hundreds of others on university
    campuses around the country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic authorities
    announced the victory of the Cultural Revolution and the closure of all
    universities in order to Islamicize the curricula. The universities
    remained closed for two years. One of the outcomes of the Cultural
    Revolution was the purging of many university professors and students
    based on their political beliefs. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Majority considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and
    anti-imperialist regime and supported it. After the spring of 1983,
    however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely because of their
    political beliefs. Arrest and detention Mr. Abbas Ali Monshi Rudsari was
    arrested in his house in July or August of 1986, along with his wife and
    two children. The officers of the Ministry of Intelligence, who came to
    arrest them, did not show them an arrest warrant. When asked why they were
    being arrested, the agents said that the neighbors had reported that they
    left their lights on in order to signal Iraqi fighter pilots where to drop
    bombs, during the Iran-Iraq war. Late
