    The information regarding Mr. Mohammad Reza Sardar Rashti’s execution was
    drawn from the Bidaran and PMOI websites. Mr. Sardar Rashti was born in
    Astara. He joined the PMOI at the advent of the Organization’s armed
    struggle against the Islamic Republic in June 1981. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown.
    According to the PMIO website, Mr. Sardar Rashti was arrested while
    distributing pamphlets for the PMIO one day after his marriage in 1984. He
    was taken to the Evin Prison and later transferred to the Gohardasht
    Prison. After the mass killing of the political prisoners began in July
    1988, he was returned to the Evin prison. He was reportedly tortured
    severely during his four years imprisonment. Trial There is no information
    about the trail or its location. Also, there is no specific information
    about the circumstances of such trials that condemned this defendant and
    thousands of other political prisoners to death in a few months period.
    The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality
    of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice
    Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed serving at the
    time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly levelled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who
    do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defence No information is available about
    the defendant’s defence. In their open letter, the families of the
    prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend
    themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated
    with guerrillas’ operating near the borders, the families submit the
    isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our
    children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10
    minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We
    witnessed, during the past seven years, that they were denied access to
    anything that would have allowed them to establish contacts outside their
    prisons' walls." Under such conditions the families reject the claim of
    the authorities that these prisoners were able to engage with the
    political groups outside Iran. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the defendant’s execution. According to the MKO website,
    Mr. Sardar Rashti was hanged in the Evin prison in December of 1988.
