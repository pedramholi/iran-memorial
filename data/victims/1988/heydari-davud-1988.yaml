    Mr. Davud Heydari was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners
    in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    by human rights organizations, interviews with victims families, and
    witnesses memoirs. Mr. Heidari is on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. Moreover, Mr. Nima Parvaresh mentions Mr.
    Heydari in his book Unequal Battle: a report of seven years in prison,
    1982 to 1989 (Peykar publication in 1995). Mr. Heydari was a sympathizer
    of the Peykar Organization and an activist in the Teacher Organization of
    Peykar. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a social imperialist state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention According to the website of Andeesheh va
    Peykar, Mr. Heydari was arrested on February 26, 1981. There is no further
    information on his arrest and detention. Trial Specific details about the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Heydari and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with attorneys or
    prosecutors. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official
    secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They
    note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and
    sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already
    completed when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly stated against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being
    associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as hypocrites who do
    not believe in Islam and wage war against God and decrees that prisoners
    who still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also
    waging war against God and should be sentenced to death. Defendants, who
    did not belong to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, may have been accused
    of being anti-religion for not having renounced his or her beliefs.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Heidari s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting
    the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had
    collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    clashes with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states tha
