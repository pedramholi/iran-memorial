    The information about Mr. Parviz Mojahednia has been sent to Omid via an
    electronic form by a person familiar with this case. Mr. Mojahednia (son
    of Ali and born in Kermanshah) is also among 3208 members and sympathizers
    of the Mojahedin Khlaq Organization whose execution was reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book
    documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. Arrest and
    detention The details of Mr. Mojahednia’s arrest and detention are not
    known, other than he was arrested in Kerman in 1988 and taken to Evin
    prison. Trial Mr. Mojahednia was tried and condemned to two years
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Mojahednia and thousands of other individuals in
    1988 are not known. According to existing information, there was no
    official trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who
    were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges At his
    first trial, Mr. Mojahednia was charged with “acting against the regime
    and membership in the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.” No charge has been
    publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their
    letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Mojahednia’s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting
    the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had
    collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes
    with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are
    false considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced
    most difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once
    every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone
    from behind the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the
    outside world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the
    truth of our claim.” Judgment Mr. Parviz Mojahednia was shot by firing
    squad in August 1988 at Evin prison. According to available information in
    the electronic form, weeks after the execution, prison authorities
    informed his family about the execution. The bodies of the victims of the
    1988 mass executions were buried in mass graves. Authorities warned the
    families of prisoners against holding memorial ceremonies.
