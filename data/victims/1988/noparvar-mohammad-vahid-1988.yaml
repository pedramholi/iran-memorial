    was kind, modest, and honest! News of Mr. Mohammad No parvar s execution
    was obtained through an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center with a person close to him (July 20, 2018), an electronic form
    filled out and sent to the Center by a person close to him (2018), and the
    story of Mr. No parvar s life, social and political activities submitted
    by a person close to him (2018). Additional information about this case
    was obtained from the Notice of Sentence served by the Central Islamic
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office on the Prison Warden (May 22, 1982), his
    two letters sent from inside prison (May 23, 1987, and March 31, 1988),
    and pictures sent by a person close to him. Mr. Mohammad (Vahid) No
    parvar, child of Allahgholi and Azemat, is one of the victims of the 1988
    mass killing of political prisoners. Most of the prisoners who were
    executed were members and supporters of the Mojahedeen Khalq Iran
    Organization (MKO). Additionally, [members and supporters of]
    Marxixt-Leninist groups opposed to the Islamic Republic such as Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization (Minority) and Peykar Party, and members and supporters
    of other parties such as Tudeh and Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Majority)
    that did not engage in any activities opposing the Islamic Republic, were
    also victims of the killings. Additional information about the 1988
    killings was obtained by the Boroumand Center from Ayatollah Montazeri s
    memoirs, human rights organizations reports, interviews with families of
    the victims, and memoirs of those who witnessed the mass murder. Mr. No
    parvar was born in Tehran on September 30, 1961, in a large family, and
    was 27 years old [at the time of his execution]. He was single and had
    studied up to twelfth grade. He began his political and social activities
    in 1978 when he was 17 years old, and was active during the 1979
    Revolution. He began his collaboration with the Mojahedeen Khalq
    Organization* after the Revolution. His activities consisted of selling
    newspapers and [taking part in] the MKO publications [department].
    According to a person close to Mr. No parvar, Vahid was one of the best
    people I ve ever known: Kind, modest, and honest! Most importantly, he was
    honest with himself. His ideal was defending and protecting the oppressed;
    he truly believed in the power of the masses, and his biggest hope was
    their victory. In spite of his young age, he helped those in need [by
    spending money] from his own pocket, in secret and without showing off.
    Mr. No parvar liked to paint and there are several paintings in existence
    that he left behind. (Boroumand Center Interview with a person close to
    him). Arrest and detention In mid-April 1982, Mr. No parvar turned himself
    in to the authorities at Evin Prison in Tehran. Toward the middle of 1981,
    a neighbor of Mr. No parvar s who was a Mojahedeen Khalq Organization
    (MKO) supporter, had been arrested and had subsequently started
    cooperating with the authorities. In the winter of 1982, the neighbor,
    accompanied by several Revolutionary Guardsmen, went to Mr. No parvar s
    home to arrest him and his brother, who were not home at the time. Mr. No
    parvar, who had been a fugitive since mid-1981, did not return home after
    that day until he turned himself in [to Evin Prison]. Considering the
    level of his activities in the MKO and his lack of support for them after
    the killing of Moussa Khiabani, one of the MKO s leaders, Mr. No parvar
    thought that he would be sentenced to a few years in prison if he turned
    himself in voluntarily, and would ultimately be released. (Boroumand
    Center Interview with a person close to him). After being interrogated and
    tried at Evin Prison, Mr. No parvar was transferred to Qezelhessar Prison.
    His two brothers were also given up by that same person and were arrested.
    He was transferred back to Evin Prison in early 1983 and was interrogated
    there along with his two brothers. He was transferred to Gohardasht Prison
    in 1985-86. In 1988, Mr. No parvar was at [the city of] Karaj s Gohardasht
    Prison, Ward 3. (Boroumand Center Interview with a person close to him).
    Mr. No parvar s first visitation with his family took place at Qezalhessar
    Prison about 3 months after he turned himself in. After that first
    visitation, he had visitations once every two weeks. In visitations that
    took place subsequent to the 1985 interrogations in Gohardasht Prison, his
    father noticed that he was unable to stand on his feet because he had been
    flogged at the bottom of his feet and had lost a lot of weight. After the
    death of Mr. No parvar s father, and upon his family s repeated requests
    and insistence, he was taken home to his mother by two Revolutionary
    Guardsmen for a two-hour visit in 1985-86. He neither said nor ate
    anything during the visit. His last visitation with his family took place
    in July 1988 at Gohardasht Prison. (Boroumand Center Interview with a
    person close to him). In the six years and four months that he spent in
    prison, Mr. No parvar was subjected to a
