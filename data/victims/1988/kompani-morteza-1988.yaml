    Mr. Morteza Kompani is one of the victims of the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In addition to members
    of those Marxist-Leninist organizations opposed to the Islamic Republic
    such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization,
    activists of organizations such as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Majority) that were not against the Islamic Republic, were also among the
    victims of this mass killings. The information about Mr. Morteza Kompani
    is taken from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by The Tudeh
    Publications. He graduated in computer science from a university in
    Germany and he returned to Iran after the revolution. He then joined the
    Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party
    ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported the former Soviet Union's
    policies. The Tudeh Party played a major role in Iran's political scene
    until it was banned for the second time following the August 19, 1953
    coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and
    the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and
    actively supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed
    the Islamic Republic, it became the target of government attacks in 1982
    when most of the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Morteza Kompani was arrested in the fall of 1983. He was
    transferred to the Joint Committee. According to the above source, he lost
    70% of his right arm’s ability due to severe torture including contortion.
    He was tortured for three weeks in order for him to confess that he was
    the Tudeh Party liaison for some officials in the Prime Minister’s Office
    and he gathered intelligence for the Soviet Union. Contortion is a
    commonly used interrogation method in which one hand from over the head is
    cuffed or tied to the other hand from behind the body at the back of the
    prisoner. The pressure may be so much as to break the shoulder blades. To
    increase the pain inflicted, the body is may be suspended in the air.
    Trial Mr. Morteza Kompani was tried and condemned to seven years
    imprisonment. There is no other information about the trial. Whether or
    not another trial had condemned him to death is not known. According to
    the available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims
    of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense
    lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee, composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No
    charge was publicly levelled against the victims of the 1988 mass
    executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners –
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who
    do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families
    of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were
    associated with guerrilla forces operating near the borders, the families
    submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside during their
    detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were
    limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through
