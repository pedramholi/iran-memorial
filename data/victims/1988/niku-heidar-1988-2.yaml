    Mr. Heidar Niku is one of the victims in the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and
    witnesses’ memoirs. The information about Mr. Heidar Niku is taken from
    the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party
    Publications. He was a physics student at Tehran University of Technology.
    After the Revolution, he joined the Tudeh Party and was responsible for
    the Youth Division of the Party in Shahr-e Rey. According to a friend from
    the university, he was a member of the theatre club of the university. He
    was a calm, dignified and responsible man; he participated in technical
    and political school activities. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in
    1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported
    policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in
    Iran’s political scene until it was banned for the second time following
    the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and therefore actively supported the new government.
    Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the
    target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party leaders and
    members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Heidar Niku was
    arrested during February 1984. He was detained in Gohardasht Prison.
    According to the above source, he was kept in the solitary confinement for
    over a year. Trial Mr. Heidar Niku was tried and condemned to six years
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Niku and thousands of other individuals in 1988
    are not known. According to existing information, there was no official
    trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were
    executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization named by the leader of
    the Islamic Republic, may have been accused of being “anti-religion” for
    not having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available about the defendant’s defence. In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were
    not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating
    near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their relativ
