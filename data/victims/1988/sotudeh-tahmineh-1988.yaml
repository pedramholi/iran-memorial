    Ms. Tahmineh Sotudeh is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and
    Particulars of Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    in 1988 during the period July-December," published January 26, 1989. The
    report specifies that although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all
    probability" there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged
    victims were members of the Mojahedin (MKO). However, members of the Tudeh
    Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization along with 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims." Ms. Tahmineh Sotudeh is listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose
    execution was reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity. This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran
    website and the PMIO website. He was a worker and a sympathizer of the
    MKO. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. According to the MKO website, Ms. Tahmineh
    Sotudeh was arrested during the demonstration on June 20, 1981. She was
    taken to Evin Prison. The demonstration of June 20, 1981, took place in
    protest against the parliament's impeachment of President Banisadr and the
    Islamic Republic's systematic policy of excluding the MKO from the
    country's political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with
    MKO leaders and his insistence to disarm them. Until that day, the MKO had
    supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to operate
    within the framework of the new political system. However, on June 20,
    1981, the MKO officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations all over the country. These
    demonstrations, which were severely suppressed by the government, resulted
    in the killing of dozens of demonstrators. Afterwards there was a wave of
    mass arrests and executions by both the Revolutionary Guards and
    para-military forces that targeted all opposition groups. The massive
    repression, unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic,
    legitimized the months-old state harassment and suppression of dissidents
    resulting in the banning of all forms of independent political dissent.
    Trial Ms. Tahmineh Sotudeh was tried and condemned to prison. There is no
    information about this trial, just as there is no specific information
    about any such trials that condemned thousands of political prisoners to
    death in a few months period. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No
    charge was ever publicly levelled against the defendant. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    accusations against the prisoners that may have led to their execution.
    These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict from the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims
    regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict,
    Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMIO's members as "hypocrites" who do not
    believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also "waging
    war against God" and should be sentenced to death. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available about the defendant’s
    defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that
    defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court.
    Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces
    operating near the borders, the families point to the isolation of their
    relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our children lived in
    most difficult conditions. All visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a
    glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. Over seven year
