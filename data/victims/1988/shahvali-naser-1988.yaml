    The information about Mr. Naser Shahvali is based on an interview by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with his brother s cellmate, and an
    electronic form sent to Omid by him. Mr. Shahvali is also listed among
    3,208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose
    executions were reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity . The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional
    information regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports from the Human Rights organizations, interviews with
    the witnesses and victims families as well as from the Bidaran website.
    [*] According to the existing information, Mr. Shahvali was born in
    Khoramshahr. He was single and a high school student. After the Iran Iraq
    war began, he migrated, along with his family, to Bushehr in 1980. He was
    a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. His older brother,
    Mansur Shahvali, was also executed during the mass killing of political
    prisoners in Bushehr in 1988. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic s leaders. [**] Arrest and detention According to
    the interviewee, Mr. Shahvali was arrested in Bushehr in 1982. After about
    two years, he was transferred, along with other prisoners, to the Adelabad
    Prison in Shiraz in order to repent them. He was transferred back to the
    Shekari Prison in Bushehr to stand another trial in 1986. Finally, in the
    fall of 1987, Mr. Shahvali was transferred, along with other prisoners,
    from Shekari Prison to the newly built Markazi Prison in Bushehr. There
    was a section for political prisoners in this new prison. Mr. Shahvali s
    family could visit him for 20 minutes biweekly. Visitations took place
    from behind two fences in Shekari Prison, and in booths with phones in
    Markazi Prison. No information is available about whether he had any
    visitation while in solitary confinement. Trial According to the
    interviewee, Mr. Shahvali was first tried and condemned to three years
    imprisonment in Bushehr Prison. After his sentence was competed, he was
    detained in prison and transferred to the Adelabad Prison in Shiraz. But
    he was returned to Bushehr for a re-trial in 1986. He was condemned again
    to three years. According to the interviewee, who was in the same prison
    at the time, prisoners had no opportunity to defend themselves nor did
    they have access to an attorney during the trials. According to the
    testimonies of some of the political prisoners who were tried during the
    executions of the summer of 1988 in Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the
    trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the prison, after a few
    weeks of isolation during which prisoners were deprived of visitation,
    television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and
    September, a three-member delegation composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the
    prosecutor, Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge, and Hojatoleslam
    Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry of Information, asked
    prisoners questions about their views on Mojahedin, whether they would
    renounce their beliefs and if they were ready to cooperate against the
    Mojahedin. Based on their answers, the prisoners would have been charged
    with counter revolutionary, anti-religion and anti-Islam or associated
    with military action or with various [opposition] groups based near the
    borders and would be sentenced to death. The authorities never informed
    prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious impli
