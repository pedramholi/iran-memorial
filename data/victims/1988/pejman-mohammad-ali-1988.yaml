    Mr. Mohammad Ali Pejman is one victim of the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Many of the executed
    prisoners were members or sympathizers of the People’s Mojahedin
    Organization of Iran (PMOI, also known as MKO). However, members or
    supporters of Marxist Leninist organizations, such as the People’s
    Fadaiyan of Iran (Minority) or Peykar, which opposed the Islamic Republic,
    as well as the Tudeh Party and Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not
    oppose the regime, were among the victims. Complementary information has
    been gathered from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human
    rights organizations, interviews with family members, and memoirs of
    witnesses, all provided to the Boroumand Foundation. Mr. Pejman is one of
    the 430 “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of 400 members and sympathizers of the Organization who
    have been executed. His execution is also reported in the book by Mr. Nima
    Parvaresh Unequal Battle: a report of seven years in prison 1982 to 1989
    (Andeesheh va Peykar Publication: 1995). Mr. Pejman was an activist among
    the Iranian Student Confederation in Kiel, Germany. He was a founder of a
    group called Peykar-e Khalq outside of Iran. This group joined the Peykar
    Organization in 1979. He was active in Tehran and an editorial board
    member of the Peykar-e Theoric publication. The Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Pejman was arrested in 1981. There is no other information on his
    arrest and detention. Trial Specific details on the circumstances of the
    trials that led to the execution of Mr. Pejman and thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. According to available information, the
    Iranian authorities did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in
    a court with the presence of defense lawyers. The prisoners executed in
    1988 had been questioned by a three-member special committee composed of a
    religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the
    Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about
    their beliefs, and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they
    argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of
    their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly stated against the
    victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of
    Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in
    February 2003, the families of the victims refer to the authorities’
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being “counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who do not
    believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also “waging
    war against God” and should be sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not
    belong to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, may have been accused of being
    “anti-religion” for not having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense N
