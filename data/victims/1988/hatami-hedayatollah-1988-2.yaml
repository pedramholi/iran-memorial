    Mr. Hedayatollah Hatami is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and
    Particulars of Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    from July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report specifies
    that although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all probability" there were
    several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were members of the
    Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan
    Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs were
    also said to be among the alleged victims." The information about Mr.
    Hatami is taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001 by The
    Tudeh Party of Iran Publications and the book Memories by Mohammad
    Rayshahri (the Chief Judge at the time) published by the Center for
    Islamic Revolution Documents. He was born in Tehran. After graduating from
    the Military College, he joined the Tudeh Party in 1942. He taught in the
    Military College for three years. In 1945, when a new government
    established in Azerbaijan (this province was occupied by the Red Army and
    an independent state was announced), he went to Tabriz and played a
    significant role in the creation of the army for the Democrat Party. After
    the Democrat Party was defeated, he escaped the country and went to the
    Soviet Union. He was a member of the Science Academy for the Socialist
    Republic of Azerbaijan from 1947 until 1974 and his writings were
    published in the party publications. After the revolution, he returned to
    Iran and continued his writings as a member of the Central Committee of
    the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh's
    ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the former
    Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran's political scene
    until it was banned for the second time following the August 19, 1953
    coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh Party declared Ayatollah
    Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members
    were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Hatami was arrested by
    the Revolutionary Guards in his home on the evening of April 27, 1983.
    According to the book Memories , 170 members of the Tudeh Party in Tehran
    and 500 members in other cities were arrested that same night. Trial
    According to the book The Tudeh Martyrs , Mr. Hatami was tried and
    condemned to life imprisonment. There is no information about the trial.
    Also, there is no specific information about the circumstances of such
    trials that condemned this defendant and thousands of other political
    prisoners to death in a few months period. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly levelled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners –
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were
    not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrillas’ operating near
    the borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Visits were l
