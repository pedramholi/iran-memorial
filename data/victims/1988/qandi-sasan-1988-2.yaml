    Mr. Sasan Qandi is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and Particulars of
    Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran from
    July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report specifies that
    although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all probability" there were
    several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were members of the
    Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan
    Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization as well as 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims." Additional information
    about Mr. Sasan Qandi is taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs by The
    Tudeh Party of Iran Publications. He was admitted to the University when
    he was only 16 years-old. He graduated with a political science major. At
    this time, he had sympathy towards the Tudeh Party. Before the revolution,
    he joined the Navid Organization (the underground organization of the
    Tudeh Party) and continued his activities in this same organization after
    the revolution. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh
    Party ideology was Marxist Leninist and it supported the former Soviet
    Union's policies. The Party played a major role in Iran's political scene
    until it was banned for the second time following the August 19, 1953
    coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and
    the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and
    actively supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed
    the Islamic Republic, it became the target of government attacks in 1982
    when most of the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Mr. Sasan Qandi was arrested in 1983. He was detained at Evin
    and Gohardasht prisons. Trial Mr. Sasan Qandi was tried and condemned to
    life imprisonment. There is no information about the trial. There is no
    specific information about other such trials that condemned thousands of
    other political prisoners to death in a few months period. According to
    the available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims
    of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense
    lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee, composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No
    charge was publicly levelled against the defendant. In their letters to
    the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting
    Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities' accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were
    not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating
    near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives
    from the outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most
    difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass
    divider through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed, over the past
    seven years, that they were denied access to anything that would have
    allowed them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under
    such conditions the families reject the claim o
