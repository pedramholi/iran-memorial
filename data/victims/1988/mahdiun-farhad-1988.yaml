    Information about Mr. Farhad Mahdiun was gathered from two electronic
    forms sent to the Boroumand Foundation by two persons, a cellmate and a
    classmate, familiar with his case. He was a victim of the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. He is one of the 559 individuals whose names
    appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class, published on the website of Andisheh
    va-Peykar. News of the execution of Mr. Farhad Mahdiun was also published
    by Andisheh va-Peykar in 1995 in the book, An Unequal Battle: a report of
    seven years in prison, from 1982 to 1989, by Nima Parvaresh. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families,
    as well as from the Bidaran website. The majority of the executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims
    included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such
    as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which
    opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan
    Khalq (Majority), which did not. Mr. Farhad Mahdiun, son of Abolfath, was
    born in 1958 and had a bachelor s degree from Allameh-Tabataba i
    University. According to a person who sent an electronic form and who had
    been his cellmate at the Evin prison for a year and a half, Farhad was
    very smart: a Marxist theorist and a teacher in the Student Department of
    Paykar. They had many philosophical and theoretical discussions together.
    The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also
    joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third
    Line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla
    struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian
    Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state,
    believed that China had deviated from Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention There is no specific information of Mr.
    Farhad Mahdiun s arrest and detention. Trial Specific details about the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Farhad
    Mahdiun are unknown. According to the testimonies of leftist political
    prisoners who were tried in Gohardasht Prison during the executions of the
    summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the
    prison after a few weeks of isolation, during which prisoners were
    deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time.
    Toward the end of August, a three-member delegation composed of
    Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious
    judge; and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry
    of Information; asked prisoners questions about whether they were Muslim
    or Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were practicing
    Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the latter were sentenced to be
    hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The authorities never
    informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious
    implications of their responses. According to survivors, during the summer
    of 1988, a large number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or
    Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to the Minister of Justice at the time,
    Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly stated
    against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. Based on the testimonies
    of those who were held in prisons in the summer of 1988, the questions of
    the three-member committee to the leftist prisoners were about their
    beliefs, and they were accused of being anti-religion, insisting on their
    beliefs and not repenting. In their letters to the Minister of Justice, in
    1988, and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against the
    prisoners accusations that may have led to their executions. These
