    Mr. Akbar Mahjubian is one of the victims in the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In addition to members
    of those Marxist-Leninist organizations oppose to the Islamic Republic,
    activists of organizations such as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Majority) that were not against the Islamic Republic, were also among the
    victims of this mass killings. The information about Mr. Mahjubian is
    taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001 by The Tudeh Party
    of Iran publications. He was a member of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party
    of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh's ideology was Marxist-Leninist and
    it supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The Tudeh Party played a
    major role in Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second
    time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the
    Tudeh Party declared that the Ayatollah Khomeini and his Islamic Republic
    regime were revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported
    the new government. Although the Tudeh Party never opposed the Islamic
    Republic, it became the target of its attacks from 1982 when most of the
    Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown. Mr.
    Mahjubian was arrested in 1983. Trial There is no information about the
    trial. Also, there is no specific information about the circumstances of
    such trials that condemned this defendant and thousands of other political
    prisoners to death in a few months period. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refuted the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly levelled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners –
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners state that defendants
    were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla troops operating
    near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives
    from the outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most
    difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass
    divider through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed, over the past
    seven years, that they were denied access to anything that would have
    allowed them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under
    such conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that
    these prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside
    Iran. It is possible that the prisoners who were members of organizations
    other than the MKO were charge for being "anti religious" and were
    condemned for insisting on their beliefs. Judgment No specific information
    is available about the defendant’s execution. Mr. Mahjubian was hanged
    during the mass killings of political prisoners in September of 1988.
