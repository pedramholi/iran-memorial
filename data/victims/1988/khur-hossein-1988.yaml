    Mr. Hossein Khur, son of Isa, is among 3208 members and sympathizers of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization whose execution was reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book
    documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. Additional
    information has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir
    of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews
    with victims’ families, witnesses’ memoirs, as well as an electronic form
    sent to Omid by a relative. Mr. Khur was born in Ramsar (Mazandaran
    Province) in 1961. He was a fourth-year chemistry student at the
    University of Science and Technology. The sender of the electronic form
    remembers him as an outstanding student who joined the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization after 1981. Arrest and detention According to the available
    information, a political colleague disclosed Mr. Khur’s identity to the
    authorities, subsequent his arrest. The officers of the Ministry of
    Intelliegnce then arrested Mr. Khur 1983 for “creating a resistance cell
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization” and detained him in Evin prison. He
    was later transferred to Qezelhesar prison and was kept there for almost 4
    years. During his imprisonment, Mr. Khur had 10-minute visits with his
    family members every 15, or at times every 30 days. Trial Mr. Khur was
    tried at Evin prison and condemned to 7 years imprisonment. Specific
    details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of
    Mr. Khur and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known.
    According to existing information, there was no official trial with the
    presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988
    were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges At the first trial, Mr. Khur was
    charged with sympathizing with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. No charge
    has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt According to the electronic form, the testimony of the
    person who disclosed Mr. Khur identity to the authorities was used as
    evidence against the latter. Defense The sender of the electronic form
    states that Mr. Khur was denied an attorney and the right to defend
    himself in the trial. In their open letter, the families of the victims of
    1988 masscare noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. The abovementioned letter, rebutting the
    accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated
    with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed
    forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are false
    considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most
    difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15
    days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind
    the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the outside
    world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of
    our claim.” Judgment The details regarding the execution sentence are not
    available. According to the electronic form, Mr. Hossein Khur was
    transferred from Qezelhesar prison “to Evin, prior to the Foruq Javidan
    operations. He and 150 other inmates were kept in one cell. In his last
    visit with his sister, he told her ‘they will execute us’ an
