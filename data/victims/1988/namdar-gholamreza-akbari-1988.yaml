    Mr. Gholamreza Akbari Namdar is listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose
    execution was reported by the organization in a book entitled “Crime
    Against Humanity”. This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran
    website. Mr. Akbari Namdar is also one of 1,000 people identified in a UN
    Human Rights Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and
    Particulars of Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    During July-December, 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all probability"
    there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were
    members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's
    Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization. Also 11
    mollahs were said to be among the alleged victims." Additional information
    about Akbari Namdar is taken from the website of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. He was born in Tabriz. He was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin
    and active in demonstrations during the revolution. After the revolution,
    he was arrested and tortured several times. He went underground when the
    Mojahedin Organization started an armed struggle against the regime.
    Arrest and detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s
    arrest and detention. Mr. Akbari Namdar was arrested in August, 1981 while
    waiting for a rendezvous on a street in Tabriz. The authorities allegedly
    had prior knowledge of this rendezvous. He was imprisoned in Tabriz for
    seven years during which time his mother visited him weekly. According to
    the Mojahedin web site, his mother said: “every time I go to visit him, he
    is either in the solitary confinement and not allowed visitation or he has
    just been tortured.” Trial Mr. Akbari Namdar was tried and sentenced to
    five years imprisonment by Tabriz court. However, there is no available
    information on a trial that resulted in his execution. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners –
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict from the Leader of
    the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri,
    his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available about the defendant’s defence. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrillas’ operating near the borders, the
    families submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside during
    their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits
    were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone
    every two weeks. We witnessed during the past seven years that they were
    denied access to anything that would have allowed them to establish
    contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such conditions the families
    reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were able to
    engage with the political groups outside Iran. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the defendant’s execution. Mr. Akbari
    Namdar was executed in Tabriz in September, 1988.
