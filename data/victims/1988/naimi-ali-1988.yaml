    Mr. Ali Na’imi was one of the victims in the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and
    witnesses’ memoirs. The information about Mr. Ali Na’imi is taken from the
    book The Martyrs of the TUdeh Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party
    Publications and the book Memoirs by Mohammad Rayshahri (Chief Judge at
    the time) published by the Center for Islamic Revolution Documents. Mr.
    Ali Na’imi was a member of the Tudeh Party and an Air Force officer. The
    Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The
    Party played a major role in Iran’s political scene until it was banned
    for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and therefore actively
    supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic
    Republic, it became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of
    the Party’s leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. The
    exact date of his arrest is not known. He was in prison five years before
    his execution. Trial According to the book Memoirs , Mr. Ali Na’imi was
    tried along with 12 others and condemned to four years imprisonment.
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Na’imi and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not
    known. According to existing information, there was no official trial with
    the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in
    1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about
    their beliefs and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges According to the book Memoirs , the charges against Mr. Ali
    Na’imi in the first trial were “membership and activity in the underground
    organization of the Tudeh Party, payment of the 500-Tuman membership fee,
    attending street meetings for Party and arranging Tudeh meetings in his
    home, participating in efforts to attract military personnel to the Party
    and continuing his political activities with the Tudeh after the decree of
    Imam [Khomeini].” No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims
    of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against
    the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization
    named by the leader of the Islamic Republic, may have been accused of
    being “anti-religion” for not having renounced his or her beliefs.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense According to the book Memoirs , in
    the first trial, the judge quoted the defendant as saying: “I don’t have
