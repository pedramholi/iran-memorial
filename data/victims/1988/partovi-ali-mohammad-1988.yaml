    Information about Mr. Ali Mohammad Partovi, son of Hamid, was taken from
    an interview with his sister. A friend sent additional information to Omid
    via an electronic form. Mr. Partovi was a victim of the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports by human rights organizations, interviews with victims
    families, and witnesses memoirs. Mr. Patrovi was born in Tabriz in June of
    1947. He was married and a mechanical engineer. His childhood friend
    states, He was compassionate and spiritual. He encouraged us to pray. He
    loved listening to the radio, and he listened to foreign radio programs in
    Farsi. His father had passed away, and he helped out his mother and
    sisters . He began his political activities in the mid-1960s. He was one
    of the founders of the Fadaiyan Khalq Guerilla Organization. He was
    arrested in 1971. He attempted to escape but was shot three times and
    arrested. He suffered from this injury for the rest of his life. He was
    then tried in a court martial, which condemned him to death. However, due
    to international outcry, his sentence was quashed and reduced to life
    imprisonment. He spent 8 years in different prisons of the previous
    regime. He was eventually released in the last group of political
    prisoners freed on January 20, 1979. After the 1979 revolution, he
    continued his work with the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization for some time. He
    was asked to be in charge of the labor section. His sister says that he
    was not happy with this post. He used to say, I was in prison and I m
    familiar with the workers. What can I tell them? The young activists and
    sympathizers know the workers much better than I do. He later left the FKO
    and joined the Sahand Organization. The Sahand Organization (or Ettehad-e
    Mobarezan-e Komonist ) was founded after the Islamic Revolution of
    February 1979, with the specific goal of focusing on theory and ideology.
    Upon being designed and developed by Sahand, the Communist Party of Iran
    was founded in 1982 by Sahand and Komala together, along with the
    remaining members of such other Communist organizations as Peykar,
    Razmandegan, and certain affiliates of the Fadaiyan Khalq. Later, Sahand
    itself was divided into a number of various factions. Once the principal
    pillar of the Communist Party of Iran, Komala then separated from the
    Party. The Communist Party of Iran is now composed mostly of Sahand
    members and there is a Kurdistan organization affiliated with it, which
    also calls itself Komala. Overall, Mr. Partovi spent 14 years of his life
    in prison. Both before and after the revolution, he was seen as a
    resistant prisoner who remained steadfast on his beliefs. That is why
    other prisoners liked him. He was also very kind and sincere. His sister
    describes his honesty by saying, He was transparent. He analyzed and
    thought deeply about issues that mattered to him. He had a good relation
    with my mother and sisters. Another of his characteristics was that he was
    humble. When the political prisoners were released in 1979, the public saw
    them as symbols of heroism. But Mr. Patrovi did not want to be seen as a
    hero. Arrest and detention Mr. Partovi was arrested on September 22, 1982,
    by the revolutionary guards on the road from Mashhad to Tehran. He was
    then taken to Tehran and kept at Tohid Prison. Tohid prison, which
    consisted mostly of solitary cells, was named the Joint Anti-Sabotage
    Committee, prior to the revolution, and used it as a place to interrogate
    and torture prisoners. After the revolution, it was renamed, but its
    function remained the same. It was first called Ward 3000 and then Tohid
    Prison. In the late 1990s, it became the Ebrat Museum. After the
    interrogation, Mr. Partovi was transferred to Evin Prison, where he was
    kept for the rest of his imprisonment. In Evin, he had visits with his
    family members and was allowed to write to them once a month, using
    special prison letter forms. His last letter to his sister is dated July
    24, 1988. A few days later, the massacre of political prisoners began.
    Trial Specific details about the circumstances of the trials that led to
    the execution of Mr. Partovi and thousands of other individuals in 1988
    are not known. According to existing information, there was no official
    trial with attorneys or prosecutors. Those who were executed in 1988 were
    sent to a three-man committee, consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about
    their beliefs
