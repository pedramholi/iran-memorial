    Mr. Mahmud Behkish is one of the victims in the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. In addition to members of those
    Marxist-Leninist organizations oppose to the Islamic Republic such as the
    Fadayian Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, activists of
    organizations such as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority)
    that were not against the Islamic Republic, were also among the victims of
    this mass killings. The information about Mr. Mahmud Behkish, a
    sympathizer of the Fadayian Khalq Organization (Majority), is based on an
    interview conducted on June 11, 2005 with a person close to him. His name
    is also drawn from a list published by the Fadayian Khalq Organization.
    Mr. Behkish had a bachelor degree in Physics from Mashhad University and
    worked as a technical expert in a production factory in Tehran. Before the
    Revolution, in 1972, he was arrested and detained for two months when he
    was studying land reform in southern Khorasan. He was arrested for the
    second time during the student strikes in Mashhad University and was
    condemned to one year imprisonment. In May of 1976, he joined the Fadayian
    Khalq Organization and went underground, and in November of the same year,
    he was arrested for the third time. He was tortured severely (with marks
    of torture evident on his feet) and condemned to life imprisonment. On
    January 16, 1979, during the Revolution, he was released. He married and
    had a three years old daughter. His sister and three brothers, who were
    all sympathizers of the Fadayian Khalq Organization (Minority), were also
    killed. Mohammad was killed in 1981, Zahra died under torture in 1983, and
    Mohsen and Mohammad Ali were executed in 1985, 1988 respectively. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 Revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority considered the Islamic Republic
    as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime and supported it. After the
    spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely
    because of their political beliefs. Arrest and detention Mr. Behkish was
    arrested by the Revolutionary Guards of Komiteh Moshtarak in his parents'
    house on August 25, 1983. According to the interviewee, the Guards were
    waiting in front of the house, and surrounded the house upon Mr. Behkish
    arrival. They did not have a warrant, but had brought with them one of Mr.
    Behkish’s brothers, Mohammad Ali, whose feet were bloody due to severe
    torture. Mr. Behkish did not resist arrest and was taken to the Joint
    Committee Prison. In February 1984, he was transferred to the Evin Prison.
    There is no information available regarding Mr. Behkish’s interrogation
    sessions, however, the interviewee adds that he did not appear to be
    tortured. Trial Mr. Mahmud Behkish was tried and condemned to 10 years
    imprisonment. There is no information about the trail sessions or its
    location. Also, there is no specific information about the circumstances
    of such trials that condemned this defendant and thousands of other
    political prisoners to death in a few months period. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges Mr. Behkish was first charged with “being a
    members of the Razmandegan Organization for Liberation of the Working
    Class” and subsequently charged with “being a sympathizer of the Fadayian
    Khalq Organization (Majority)." No charge has been publicly levelled
    against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988),
    and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the
    prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims
    regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict,
    Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's m
