    Ms. Fatemeh Hamzeh’i is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    People’s Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the Organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran website and the PMIO
    website. She was born in Tehran in 1958. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Ms.
    Fatemeh Hamzeh’i was arrested and taken to Evin prison in 1981. She was
    transferred to solitary confinement in 1985. Trial Ms. Fatemeh Hamzeh’i
    was tried and condemned to prison term. Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Ms. Hamze’i and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with the presence of an
    attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This
    committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs
    and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of
    the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against
    the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available about her defense. In their open letter, the
    families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the
    accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated
    with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed
    forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are false
    considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most
    difficult conditions [in the prison, with] visitation rights of once every
    15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone from
    behind the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the
    outside world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the
    truth of our claim.” Judgment No specific information is available about
    the execution sentence. Ms. Fatemeh Hamzeh’i was hanged during the mass
    killings of the political prisoners at Evin Prison in August 1988.
