    Information about Mr. Amir Ta avoni Ranji, son of Abbas, was gathered from
    an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a friend. Mr. Ta
    avoni-Ranji is also listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were reported by the
    organization in a book titled Crime Against Humanity . He is also one of
    1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission Special
    Representative s Report published on January 26, 1989. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families,
    as well as the Bidaran website. * According to the electronic form, Mr.
    Amir Ta avoni Ranji was born in Tehran. He had a bachelor s degree and
    owned a confectionery at the Mokhberoldoleh Intersection called Gol-e
    Sorkh [Rose]. He was a member of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to a split in the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and to recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, whether by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. ** Arrest and Detention No specific information is available on
    Mr. Amir Ta avoni Ranji's arrest and detention. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Amir Ta avoni Ranji s trial. According to the testimonies
    of some of the political prisoners who were tried during the executions of
    the summer of 1988 in Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the trials took place
    in a room on the ground floor of the prison after a few weeks of
    isolation, during which prisoners were deprived of visitation, television
    and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and September, a
    three-member delegation, composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor;
    Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge; and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi,
    the representative of the Ministry of Information, asked prisoners
    questions about their views on the Mojahedin, whether they would renounce
    their beliefs, and if they were ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin.
    Based on what the answers were, the prisoners would have been charged with
    being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion and anti-Islam, or, associated
    with military action or with various [opposition] groups based near the
    borders and would be sentenced to death. The authorities never informed
    prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious implications of
    their responses. During the summer of 1988, according to survivors, a
    large number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or leftist
    groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then-Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed when they were retried and sentenced to death.
    Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of the
    1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988)
    and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against the
    prisoners accusations that may have led to their executions. These
    accusations include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and ant
