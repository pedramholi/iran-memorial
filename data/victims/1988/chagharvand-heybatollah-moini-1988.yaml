    The information about the execution of Mr. Heibatollah Mo’ini Chagharvand,
    a psychology student in Tehran University, was given to Omid in an
    interview by a family member. Mr. Mo’ini Chagharvand was a victim of the
    mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims
    included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such
    as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which
    opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan
    Khalq (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has
    been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Mr. Mo’ini Chaghavand was married and
    had a daughter. He was a member of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization and had
    spent six years in prison under the previous regime. He had been released
    one year before the Revolution. The Fadayian Khalq Guerilla Organization,
    a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. A number of the
    Organization’s members, who did not renounce armed struggle, founded the
    group the Fadayian Khalq Guerillas (Ashraf Dehqan Branch). Arrest and
    detention Mr. Mo’ini Chaghavand was arrested on November 8, 1982 on Fatemi
    Avenue in Tehran. He was reportedly detained in the Joint Committee of
    Evin prison in Tehran. His contact with his family members was limited to
    a phone call every seven or eight months. His first visit with his family
    took place two years after his arrest. The authorities allowed his mother
    and spouse to visit him several times after the first visit. He had
    reportedly been severely tortured. Trial Mr. Mo’ini Chaghavand’s first
    trial took place behind closed doors and he was denied the right to have
    an attorney. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Mo’ini Chaghavand and thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney and
    prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges Based on
    the available information, the defendant was accused of “belonging to the
    Central Committee of the Fadaiyan Khalq organization and insisting on the
    apostate views of the organization.” Evidence of guilt The evidence
    against the defendant is believed to have been based on the testimony of
    the person who had disclosed Mr. Mo’ini Chagharvand’s political activities
    and identity to the authorities. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Mo’ini Chagharvand’s defense. In their open letter, the families of
    the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that
    these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed
    members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed forces of the
    Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are false considering the
    circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most difficult conditions
    [in prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15 days, each visitation
    lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind the glass window, and
    were deprived of any connection with the outside world. We faced such
    conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of our claim.” Judgment
    The defendant was sentenced to death. However, the sentence was reduced to
    life imprisonment due to the pressure exerted by Amnesty International and
    efforts of some clerics, with whom the family had contact. Nevertheless,
    Mr. Mo’ini Chagharvand was executed on August 31, 1988 during the massacre
    of political prisoners.
