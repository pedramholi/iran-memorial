    Information regarding Mr. Amir Mir arab Bayegi was obtained through
    interview with one of his relatives. Further information was provided by
    the cellmate of Mr. Mir arab Bayegi s wife (in 1984). Mr. Mir arab Bayegi
    s name (spelled Amir Arab) also appears in the book Koshtar-e 67 [Massacre
    of 88] by Dr. Mas ud Ansari. Mr. Amir Mir arab Bayegi was a member of the
    Tudeh Party in the last years of his life. He started his political
    activity by opposing the monarchy as a university student during the Shah
    s time. He was a student at the Sharif University of Technology. He was
    arrested in the 1970s and spent three years in prison. Once released, he
    joined the groups that later developed into the organization Rah-e Kargar
    [Worker s Path] of which he, then, became a member. Rah-e Kargar or the
    Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran was established in the summer
    of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist
    groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political
    action. They identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a
    socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed
    with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the
    Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini s leadership. Other members of Mr.
    Mir arab Bayegi s family were also arrested in the Islamic Republic. In
    1981, his mother and sister were arrested. His wife, who according to her
    cellmate was no longer politically active, was arrested a few months after
    Mr. Mir'arab Bayegi in the spring of 1984 along with their nine-month-old
    son. The baby spent two months in a small cell in Evin Prison s Ward 209.
    Then, because he cried so much, the mother had to send him out to her
    family while he was still nursing. She spent several months in custody.
    Arrest and detention There is no specific information on the defendant s
    arrest and detention. Trial Specific details on the circumstances of the
    trials that led to the execution of Mr. Amir Mir arab Bayegi and thousands
    of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to the available
    information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of the 1988
    mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense lawyer. The
    prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member
    special committee, composed of a religious judge, a representative of the
    Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned
    the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and their faith in God and
    religion. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice
    Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had already been tried and sentenced to prison
    terms, which they were either serving or had already completed serving at
    the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has
    been publicly leveled against the defendant. In their letters to the
    Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities
    accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI members as hypocrites who do
    not believe in Islam and wage war against God and decrees that prisoners
    who still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also
    waging war against God and should be sentenced to death. Defendants, who
    did not belong to the Organization named by the leader of the Islamic
    Republic, may have been accused of being anti-religion for not having
    renounced their beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mir arab Bayegi s
    defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners noted that
    defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court.
    The same letter, refuting the accusation that these prisoners (from inside
    the prison) had collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin
    Organization in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states
    that such claim are false considering the circumstances in prisons; for
    our children faced most difficult conditions [in the prison, with]
