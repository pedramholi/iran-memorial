    Mr. Ali Reza (Shapur) Eskandari is one of the victims in the mass killings
    of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners
    were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. His wife’s trial, (who was arrested with
    him the second time he was arrested) lasted for only a few minutes. The
    information about Mr. Ali Reza Eskandari is taken from an interview with a
    person close to him. His name also appears on a list published by the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Majority). Mr. Eskandari was born in Malayer
    (Hamedan province) in 1953. He was a chemical engineer having graduated
    from Tehran Polytechnic University. As an alternative to compulsory
    military service, he worked in a copper mine in Sarcheshmeh in Kerman
    province. Afterwards, he worked for several private companies. He was a
    sympathizer of the Fadayian Khalq Organization and when the organization
    split, he joined the Fadayian Khalq Organization (Majority). The Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban
    Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded
    in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following
    the 1979 Revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle,
    split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union.
    The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority considered the Islamic Republic as a
    revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime and supported it. After the
    spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely
    because of their political beliefs. Arrest and detention Mr. Eskandari was
    once arrested on the street in July of 1981, and was detained in section
    209 of Evin Prison for four months. As his identity was disclosed by a
    friend who had been detained, he was arrested for a second time by the
    Revolutionary Guards on March 21, 1984, along with his wife for “the
    suspicion of having narcotic drugs”. First, he was taken to the Joint
    Committee of Tehran-e Noe and then to Evin Prison. The interviewee quotes
    one of the released prisoners saying: “They flogged him for eight days
    straight. As a result, his feet became strangely deformed with a
    fist-shaped extra piece of flesh on his foot. They used the contortion
    method on him for 38 days. Afterwards he became psychologically imbalanced
    in a way that when he heard any female voice, he was convinced it was his
    wife who was naked.” He had two visits with his wife in presence of two
    Revolutionary Guards. Contortion was a commonly used interrogation method
    in which one hand from over the head is cuffed or tied to the other hand
    from behind the body at the back of the prisoner. The pressure may be so
    much as to break the shoulder blades. To increase the pain inflicted, the
    body is may be suspended in the air. Trial Mr. Ali Reza Eskandari was
    tried at Evin Prison and condemned to death in August 1984. This death
    sentence was confirmed by the appeal court in absentia. According to the
    available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of
    the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense
    lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee, composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. Whether or not such a committee also
    condemned him to death is not known. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Ali Reza Eskandari in his first trial were “membership
    of the Fadayian Khalq Majority and being responsible for propaganda in
    Tehran.” No charges were ever publicly leveled against the victims of the
    1988 mass execution. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988),
    and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the
    families of the victims refer to the accusations against the prisoners
    that may have led to their exec
