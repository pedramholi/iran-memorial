    Friends described her as very brave. Jumping rope and hiking were her
    simple pleasures. The information about Ms. Mehrangiz Mohammad-Rahimi,
    daughter of Jalil, was gathered from interviews with her relatives. She is
    also listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, whose executions were reported by the organization in a book
    entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book documents the 1988-1989 mass
    execution of political prisoners in Iran. Ms. Mohammad-Rahimi was born in
    Tehran in 1958. After she graduated from Fatemeh Amini High School in
    Tehran, she became a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The
    interviewee remembers her as a friendly and happy person. She liked
    sports. She enjoyed jumping rope and hiking. She was very brave. Her
    sister, Ms. Soheila Mohammad-Rahimi, was also one of the victims of the
    mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. Her brothers, Aziz and
    Hushang were executed in 1981 and 1992 respectively. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and Detention Ms.
    Mohammad-Rahimi was arrested on the street after a demonstration in Tehran
    on June 17, 1981, at age 23. Her friends informed her family of her
    arrest. She was detained in Evin Prison for two months and then taken to
    Qezelhesar Prison. As punishment, she was transferred to Gohardasht prison
    in the winter of 1983 and spent 18 months in solitary confinement. In July
    of 1985, she was taken to Qezelhesar prison where for two months she was
    imprisoned in the same cell as her sister Soheila. In 1986, she was
    returned to Evin Prison. She had some visits during her seven-year
    detention; the first was with her father in the spring of 1982, and the
    last was in July of 1988. Trial Ms. Mohammad-Rahimi was tried in 1981 and
    condemned to seven years imprisonment. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney or
    prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee, consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then-Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges At her trial in
    1981, Ms. Mohammad-Rahimi was charged with sympathizing with the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. No charge has been publicly leveled against the
    victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of
    Justice (1988) and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February
    2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations
    against the prisoners accusations that may have led to their execution.
    These accusations include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An edict of the Leader
    of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Kho
