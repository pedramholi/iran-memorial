    Ms. Zohreh 'Einolyaqin is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and
    Particulars of Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    during the period July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The
    report specifies that although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all
    probability" there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged
    victims were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). However,
    members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar,
    and Komala Organization as well as 11 mollahs were also said to be among
    the alleged victims." Ms. Zohreh 'Einolyaqin is listed among 3,208 members
    and sympathizers of the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO)
    whose execution was reported by the Organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity. This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran
    website and the PMIO website. She was born in Esfahan. She had a bachelors
    degree and was a sympathizer of the MKO. She was a MKO candidate for the
    parliament (Majles) election in 1979. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Ms.
    Zohreh 'Einolyaqin was arrested and transferred to Evin Prison during
    1981. Trial Ms. Zohreh 'Einolyaqin was tried and condemned to 15 years
    imprisonment. There is no information about the trial, just as there is no
    specific information of any such trials that condemned thousands of
    political prisoners to death in just a few months period. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly levelled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the accusations against the prisoners that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict from the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    reproduced in the memoirs of his designated successor, Ayatollah
    Montazeri, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the
    PMIO's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "who wage
    war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the
    positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God" and
    should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available about the defendant’s defence. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Our visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed, over seven years, that
    they were denied access to anything that would have allowed them to
    establish contacts outside their prison walls." Under such conditions the
    families reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were
    able to engage with the political groups outside Iran. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the defendant’s execution.
    According to the MKO website, Ms. Zohreh 'Einolyaqin was hanged during the
    mass killings of the political prisoners in Evin Prison during August
    1988.
