    Information about Mr. Mohammad Reza Tababati Tabari has been drawn from an
    interview with a relative. Additional information has been taken from the
    website of the Union of People’s Fadaiyan of Iran, as well as the article
    “Time of Visitation” by Mr. Mehdi Aslani, published in the Arash magazine
    number 100. Mr. Tababati Tabari was a victim of the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Mr. Tababati Tabari was born in Babol
    (Mazandaran province) and was the youngest child in a loving family. He
    was a brilliant student; he passed grade 5 and 6 during the same year, and
    was ahead of his peers. He went to school in Babol and later in Tehran.
    Having graduated from Kharazmi High School in Tehran, he enrolled in
    Mashhad University and studied medicine. He loved movies; he would mimic
    actors after watching a movie and make others laugh. In university, Mr.
    Tababati Tabari started his political activities as a sympathizer of the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization and in opposition to the monarchy.
    Consequently he was arrested and imprisoned for 6 months until a few
    months before the Revolution when all political prisoners were freed. He
    then continued his work with the Fadaiyan Khlaq Organization. After the
    universities closed in relations to the Cultural Revolution, he left
    Mashhad and went back to Babol where he started working a small shop.
    Later he moved to Tehran. After the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization split, Mr.
    Tababati Tabari supported the Majority Branch. In 1981, when the Majority
    Branch split into other factions, Mr. Tababati Tabari became a follower of
    the Keshtgar Faction. He spent some time in Golan province, where,
    according to the Union of Fadaiyan website, he was a member of the state
    committee. There he was arrested again and imprisoned for a few months.
    The Cultural Revolution began after Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech in
    March 1980 and ordered that universities be purged of all those who
    opposed his regime and be transformed into “learning environments” [as
    opposed to political forums] where “an all-Islamic curriculum” is taught.
    The first wave of violence began on April 15, 1980 during a speech by
    Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic
    Revolution and Minister of Interior] at the University of Tabriz.
    Following the speech, students supporting the regime took control of the
    University’s central building and demanded that the “university be purged”
    from “pro-Shah elements and other sellouts.” On April 18, the Council of
    the Islamic Revolution issued a communiqué accusing political groups of
    converting higher education institutions into “headquarters of discordant
    political activities” and naming them as obstacles to the radical
    transformation of the universities. The communiqué gave these groups three
    days (Saturday April 19 to Monday April 21) to shut down their activities
    in the universities. The Council stressed that the decision included
    libraries along with activities related to arts and sports. Political
    groups, which recruited members and had strong support in the
    universities, refused to evacuate. Before the end of the Council’s
    deadline, serious clashes took place between leftist groups and Islamist
    Associations, in opposition to the Associations, sometimes supported by
    security forces and paramilitary groups. These clashes, which peaked at
    the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in the death of several people
    and the wounding of hundreds of others on university campuses around the
    country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic authorities announced the
    victory of the Cultural Revolution and the closure of all universities in
    order to Islamicize the curricula. The universities remained closed for
    two years. One of the outcomes of the Cultural Revolution was the purging
    of many university professors and students based on their political
    beliefs. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group,
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin
    America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the Organization, which had
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority considered the
    Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime and
    supported it. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic
    targeted it
