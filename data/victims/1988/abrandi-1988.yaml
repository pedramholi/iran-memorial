    Mr. Abrandi is on a list of people allegedly executed in Iran. This list
    was published in a Report of the Economic and Social Council of the United
    Nations on The Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
    The report was prepared by Professor Reynaldo Galindo Pohl in November
    1990. Aditional information about Mr. Abrandi is taken from the book
    Martyrs in the Path to Freedom , copyright 1988 by Rah-e Kargar
    publications. He was a sympathizer of the Revolutionary Workers
    Organization of Iran-Rah-e Kargar. He was over 50 years old when executed.
    The execution date in the UN report is different from what Rah-e Kargar
    reported. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of
    Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded
    by individuals from various leftist groups who had rejected the idea of
    armed struggle and believed in political action. They called themselves
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. But, it has been reported to the United Nations'
    special representative: "Trials before Islamic Revolutionary Courts have
    usually taken place in secret, sometimes inside prisons; defendants have
    not usually enjoyed the right to be represented by a lawyer, and often
    have not even been made aware that the proceedings were in fact a trial
    and not an interrogation session." Charges No information is available on
    Mr. Abrandi’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available about the defendant’s defence. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the defendant’s execution.
    According to the Rah-e Kargar book, Mr. Abrandi was executed by a firing
    squad in the Evin prison in the spring of 1988.
