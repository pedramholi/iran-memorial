    Information regarding the execution of Mr. Mahmud Honari (Emad-Jamal) was
    sent via an electronic form by a person familiar with the case. Mr. Honari
    was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The
    Boroumand Foundation has also gathered information about the 1988 mass
    executions from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports by human rights
    organizations, interviews with survivors and victims’ families, and
    witnesses’ memoirs. According to the electronic form, Mr. Mahmud Honari
    was born in Birjand in 1955, lived and finished high school in Zahedan and
    graduated from Tarbiate-Mo’alem University (Tehran) in Geography major. He
    became politically active during the revolution and joined the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class * He was active in
    the student movement and in Kurdistan following the closure of the
    universities in 1980. In 1981, Mr. Honari joined the Sahand Organization
    and ultimately the Communist Party of Iran of which, he was a founding
    member. He was married and had a son. Mr. Honari’s friends remember him as
    kind and determined. The Sahand Organization (or Ettehad-e Mobarezan-e
    Komonist) was founded after the Islamic Revolution of February 1979, with
    a specific focus on ideology. After Sahand developed the project of the
    Communist Party of Iran in 1982, and the Party was founded by Sahand and
    Komala and remainders of such Communist organizations as Peykar,
    Razmandegan, and some affiliates of the Fadaiyan Khalq. Later on, this
    party was divided into various factions. The majority of the prisoners
    executed during the 1988 prison killings were members of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO, also known as People’s Mojahedin Organization of
    Iran - PMOI). Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Arrest
    and detention According to the information sent to Omid, in the fall of
    1986, Mr. Honari, whose contacts with his organizations were cut off,
    decided to take his family to his birthplace, Birjand in order to leave
    the country. But he was arrested along with his wife and son and
    transferred to Tehran immediately where he was detained until his
    execution. Mr. Honari’s spouse was also imprisoned and released after two
    and a half year. Trial There is not information on whether or not Mr.
    Honari was tried and sentenced following his arrest in 1986. According to
    the available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims
    of the 1988 mass execution in a court with the presence of defense
    lawyers. The prisoners executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    leveled publicly against the victims of the 1988 mass killings. Based on
    the testimonies of survivors, the delegation asked leftist prisoners about
    their belief and their parents belief in God and on their willingness to
    pray. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN
    Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners –
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who
    do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God," and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also "waging war against God," and should be sentenced to death. Based
    on the available information, defendants who did not belong to the
    organization named by the leader of the Islamic Republic may have been
    tried for being "anti-religion" and for refusing to recant. Evidence of
    guilt T
