    Information about Mr. Nader Asadi was gathered from an electronic form
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with this case and
    the listing of victims of the 1988 massacres, published by the Asr-eNo
    website. Mr. Nader Asadi is also listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were
    reported by the organization in a book titled Crime Against Humanity . He
    is also one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission
    Special Representative s Report, published on January 26, 1989. The
    Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information regarding the
    1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families,
    as well as from the Bidaran website. * According to the electronic form,
    Mr. Nader Asadi, son of Amir, was born in Abadan. He was married with one
    child and an employee of the Iran Oil Company. He had helped many families
    to escape arrest and prosecution. According to the Mojahedin Khalq website
    and Asr-e No, he was born in Masjed-e Soleiman. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released,
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic s leaders. ** Arrest and Detention No
    specific information is available on Mr. Nader Asadi's arrest and
    detention. According to the electronic form, he had been tortured so
    severely during his three months detention that recognizing his body was
    difficult. Trial No information is available on Mr. Nader Asadi s trial.
    According to the testimonies of some of the political prisoners, who were
    tried during the executions of the summer of 1988, in some of the prisons;
    the trials took place in a room in the prison, after a few weeks of
    isolation, during which prisoners were deprived of visitation, television
    and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and September, a
    three-member delegation composed of the public prosecutor, a religious
    judge, and a representative of the Ministry of Information asked prisoners
    questions about their views on the Mojahedin, whether they would renounce
    their beliefs, and if they were ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin.
    Based on what the answers were, the prisoners would have been charged with
    counter revolutionary, anti-religion and anti-Islam, or associated with
    military action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders
    and would be sentenced to death. The authorities never informed prisoners
    about the delegation s purpose and the serious implications of their
    responses. During the summer of 1988, according to survivors, a large
    number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were
    executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    the then-Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official
    secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They
    note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and
    sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already
    completed when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988) and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
