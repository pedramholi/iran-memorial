    The information about Mr. Ali Sharif-Tabarestani, son of Mohammadtaqi, was
    gathered from an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a
    person familiar with this case. He was born in Babol in February of
    1957.After graduating from high school during the previous regime, he was
    accepted as a civil engineering major but rejected by authorities due to
    his political activities. Mr. Ali Sharif-Tabarestani is also listed among
    3,208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose
    executions were reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity . The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional
    information regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports from the Human Rights organizations, interviews with
    the witnesses and victims families as well as from the Bidaran website. *
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. ** Arrest and Detention Mr. Ali Sharif-Tabarestani was arrested
    in Babol on a summer day in 1982 at 4 a.m. No specific information is
    available on his arrest and detention. Trial No information is available
    on Mr. Ali Sharif-Tabarestani s trial. According to the testimonies of
    some of the political prisoners who were tried during the executions of
    the summer of 1988 in some of the prisons, the trials took place in a room
    in the prison after a few weeks of isolation during which prisoners were
    deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoors
    time. In August and September, a three-member delegation composed of the
    public prosecutor, a religious judge, and a representative of the Ministry
    of Information asked prisoners questions about their views on Mojahedin,
    whether they would renounce their beliefs and if they were ready to
    cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the
    prisoners would have been charged with counter revolutionary,
    anti-religion and anti-Islam or associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders and would be sentenced
    to death. The authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s
    purpose and the serious implications of their responses. According to
    survivors, during the summer of 1988 a large number of prisoners
    sympathizing with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not
    recanting their beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988
    refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of
    executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then-Minister of
    Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988) and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being
    associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
