    Information about Ms. Fazilat Allameh Ha’eri was obtained from two
    electronic forms filled in by one of her former fellow cellmates and
    another individual familiar with this case. Ms. Allameh Ha’eri is among
    the 3208 members and sympathizers of the People’s Mojahedin of Iran
    Organization (PMIO) whose execution was reported by the organization in a
    book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book documents the 1988-89
    mass execution of political prisoners. Additional information was drawn
    from the Bidaran website. Ms. Allameh Ha’eri was an architecture student
    at the Technical Faculty of Tehran University before it was closed for
    Cultural Revolution in 1979. The Cultural Revolution began after Ayatollah
    Khomeini gave a speech in March 1980 and ordered that universities be
    purged of all those who opposed his regime and be transformed into
    “learning environments” [as opposed to political forums] where “an
    all-Islamic curriculum” is taught. The first wave of violence began on
    April 15, 1980 during a speech by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani [a member of
    the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister of Interior] at the
    University of Tabriz. Following the speech, students supporting the regime
    took control of the University’s central building and demanded that the
    “university be purged” from “pro-Shah elements and other sellouts.” On
    April 18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution issued a communiqué
    accusing political groups of converting higher education institutions into
    “headquarters of discordant political activities” and naming them as
    obstacles to the radical transformation of the universities. The
    communiqué gave these groups three days (Saturday April 19 to Monday April
    21) to shut down their activities in the universities. The Council
    stressed that the decision included libraries along with activities
    related to arts and sports. Political groups, which recruited members and
    had strong support in the universities, refused to evacuate. Before the
    end of the Council’s deadline, serious clashes took place between leftist
    groups and Islamist Associations, in opposition to the Associations,
    sometimes supported by security forces and paramilitary groups. These
    clashes, which peaked at the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in
    the death of several people and the wounding of hundreds of others on
    university campuses around the country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic
    authorities announced the victory of the Cultural Revolution and the
    closure of all universities in order to Islamicize the curricula. The
    universities remained closed for two years. One of the outcomes of the
    Cultural Revolution was the purging of many university professors and
    students based on their political beliefs. Arrest and detention Ms.
    Allameh Ha’eri was arrested in 1981. She was denied an attorney during her
    interrogation and detention. She served part of her term in Ward 209 of
    Evin Prison (Branch 6), which consisted of solitary cells, interrogation
    rooms, and a basement used for torture. From 1987 to July 1988 when she
    was taken for execution, she was held in Ward 3 of the Asayeshgah
    (literally meaning “sanitarium”) section. Trial Years before her
    execution, Ms. Allameh Ha’eri was tried, without an attorney or benefit of
    her rights, and sentenced to life imprisonment. It is not clear whether or
    not a second trial was held to issue the death sentence. According to the
    available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of
    the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense
    lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee, composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is the proof of their illegality. They note
    that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and
    sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already
    completed serving, at the time they were retried and sentenced to death.
    Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of the
    1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988),
    and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities’ accusations against the
    prisoners; accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republi
