    Mr. Fathollah Golabru’s name, an affiliate of the Razmandegan
    Organization, is taken from the book Those Who Said No , published in 1999
    in Paris by the Association for the Defense of Political Prisoners and
    Prisoners of Conscience in Iran. He was a victim of the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports by human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. The Razmandegan Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded in the winter of 1979. Its
    activities were focused on the working class and factories. The founding
    tenets of Razmandegan included the rejection of armed struggle and a
    strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party.
    It viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state and believed
    that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles. Razmandegan
    was among the groups that became known as Khat-e Se (Third line). By early
    1981, disagreements on the Party’s position on the Iran-Iraq war caused
    internal splits in Razmandegan. These splits, which coincided with the
    massive and brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian government,
    caused the Organization to disband. Arrest and detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial
    Specific details about the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Golabru and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are
    not known. According to existing information, there was no official trial
    with attorneys or prosecutors. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent
    to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative
    from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This
    committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs
    and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue
    that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed when they were retried and sentenced to death.
    Charges No charge has been publicly stated against the victims of the 1988
    mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988, and
    to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the families
    of the victims refer to the authorities’ accusations against the prisoners
    – accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as
    well as being “associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, may have been accused of being “anti-religion” for not
    having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Golabru’s defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves
    in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners
    (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic
    Republic, states that such claims “are false considering the circumstances
    in prisons; for our children faced the most difficult conditions [in
    prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15 days, each visitation
    lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind the glass window, and
    were deprived of any connection with the outside world. We
