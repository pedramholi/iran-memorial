    Mr. Hushang Nazemi (Amir Nika’in) is one of the victims in the mass
    killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Other
    victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Information about
    the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the
    memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations,
    interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs. The information
    about Mr. Hushang Nazemi is taken from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh
    Party of Iran by The Tudeh Party ublications. He was born in Tehran. He
    graduated from Bucharest University majoring in Philosophy. In 1949 after
    high school, he went to France to continue his education. A year later, he
    joined the Tudeh Party. He was a student delegate to several international
    meetings. Before the Revolution, he was an advisor to the Central
    Committee of the Tudeh Party and after the Revolution he became a full
    member of this Committee. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The
    Tudeh ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the
    former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran’s political
    scene until it was banned for the second time following the August 19,
    1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah
    Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and therefore actively supported the new government.
    Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the
    target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party leaders and
    members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Hushang Nazemi was
    arrested during May 1983. Trial Mr. Hushang Nazemi was tried and condemned
    to imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that
    led to the execution of Mr. Nazemi and thousands of other individuals in
    1988 are not known. According to existing information, there was no
    official trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who
    were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving at the time they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge was ever publicly
    levelled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of
    Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February
    2003), the families of the victims refer to the accusations against the
    prisoners that may have led to their execution. These accusations include
    being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as
    being “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups
    based near the borders.” An edict from the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    reproduced in the memoirs of his designated successor Ayatollah Montazeri
    corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against the
    executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the MKO
    members as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war against
    God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken
    by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available about his defense. In their open letter, the
    families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: “Our children lived under most difficult
    conditions. Our visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed over seven years that
    they were denied access to anything that would have allowed them to
    establish contacts outside their prison walls.” Under such conditions the
