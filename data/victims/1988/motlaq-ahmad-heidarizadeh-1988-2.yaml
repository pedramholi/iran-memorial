    Mr. Ahmad Heidarizadeh Motlaq was one of the victims in the mass killings
    of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners
    were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In addition to
    members of those Marxist-Leninist organizations opposed to the Islamic
    Republic, activists of organizations such as the Tudeh Party and the
    Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority) that were not against the Islamic Republic, were
    also among the victims of this mass killings. The information about Mr.
    Ahmad Heidarizadeh Motlaq is taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs ,
    copyright 2001 by The Tudeh Party of Iran publications. He was a
    literature student in Tehran University. He joined the Tudeh Party in 1979
    and became a member of the editorial board for the Etehad publication. The
    Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh's ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The
    Tudeh Party played a major role in Iran's political scene until it was
    banned for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the
    1979 Revolution, the Tudeh Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the
    Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively
    supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic
    Republic, it became the target of its attacks from 1982 when most of the
    Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr.
    Heidarizadeh Motlaq was arrested in August, 1983. According to the Tudeh
    Martyrs book, he was tortured for five months and spent time in the
    hospital. His family had no information about where he was being kept for
    the five months after his arrest. He was denied visitation most of the
    time. Trial Mr. Heidarizadeh Motlaq was tried and condemned to three years
    imprisonment. There is no information about the trial. Also, there is no
    specific information about the circumstances of such trials that condemned
    this defendant and thousands of other political prisoners to death in a
    few months period. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988
    refuted the legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of
    executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of
    Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed serving at the
    time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge was
    publicly levelled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who
    do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defence In their open letter, the families
    of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were
    associated with guerrilla troops operating near the borders, the families
    submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside during their
    detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were
    limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two
    weeks. We witnessed, over the past seven years, that they were denied
    access to anything that would have allowed them to establish contacts
    outside their prisons' walls." Under such conditions the families reject
    the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were able to engage with
    the political groups outside Iran. It is possible that the prisoners who
    were members of organizations other than the MKO were charge for being
    "anti religious" and were condemned for insisting on their beliefs.
    Judgment No specific information is available about the defendant’s
    execution. Mr. Ahmad Heidarizadeh Motlaq was hanged during the mass
    killing of political prisoners in the Gohardasht Prison, in September
    1988. The officials did not inform his family
