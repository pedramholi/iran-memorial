    The information about Mr. Mojtaba Qadiani is based on an interview with
    his brother. His name is also mentioned in a UN Human Rights Commission’s
    Special Representative’s Report, “Names and particulars of persons
    allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the period
    July-December 1988,” published January 26, 1989. He was a sympathizer of
    the Peykar Organization and a victim of the 1988-89 mass executions of
    political prisoners in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Many of the executed
    prisoners were members or sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO). However, members or supporters of Marxist Leninist organizations,
    such as the People’s Fadaiyan of Iran (Minority) or Peykar, which opposed
    the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not oppose the regime, were among the victims.
    Complementary information has been gathered from the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with family
    members, and memoirs of witnesses, all provided to the Boroumand
    Foundation. Mr. Mojtaba Qadiani was born in Tehran in 1963. He was a
    student and was active in the distribution of Peykar publications through
    the student sympathizers of Peykar known as the Daldal Organization.
    Before his arrest, he worked in his uncle’s knitting workshop, where he
    spent the nights. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “Socialist
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Mojtaba Qadiani was arrested by plain clothes agents in his uncle’s
    knitting workshop in the summer of 1982. The agents did not show any
    arrest warrant, telling his uncle that it was not a serious issue and they
    just wanted to ask Mr. Qadiani a few questions. His detention locations
    were Qezelhesar, Gohardasht, and Evin. According to his brother, Mr.
    Mojtaba Qadiani was denied the right to have an attorney and had no access
    to his file. At Qezelhesar prison, he had some visitations with his
    mother, but had no visitation at Gohardasht prison and had only one
    visitation every three months at Evin. His brother added: “I was a child
    at the time and went with my mother to visit him several times. The
    visitation period was about 15 minutes.” He referred to the interrogation
    methods as, “twice they broke his right hand. A few times, his chest area
    was bandaged. According to my mother and what I saw myself, his hand was
    always in a sling around his neck and his chest was bandaged at Evin.”
    Trial According to his brother, Mr. Mojtaba Qadiani was tried and
    condemned to ten years imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances
    of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Mojtaba Qadiani and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of
    the 1988 mass execution in a court with the presence of a defense lawyer.
    The prisoners executed in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member
    special committee composed of a religious judge, a representative of the
    Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned
    the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and their faith in God and
    religion. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed at the time they were retried
    and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled
    against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988),
    and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities’ accusations against the
    prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition
