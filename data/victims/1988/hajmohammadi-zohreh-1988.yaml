    Information about Ms. Zohreh Hajmohammadi has been sent to Omid by her
    former cellmate via an electronic form. Ms. Hajmohammadi is among 3208
    members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO, also
    PMIO) whose execution was reported by the organization in a book entitled
    Crime Against Humanity . This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Ms. Hajmohammadi was a sympathizer of
    the MKO. Her cellmate remembers her as very kind and with a good sense of
    humor. Arrest and detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest, although she was probably arrested in 1981. She spend
    her years of imprisonment in Evin, Qezelhesar, and Gohardasht prisons,
    mostly in cells, where conditions were particularly difficult in order to
    “punish” the prisoners only due to the fact that she protested to inhuman
    treatment of prisoners. She spent the summer of 1988 in section 3 of ward
    1 of Gohardast, known as “sanatorium.” In the “sanatorium” the doors to
    the rooms were always locked and would be open only 3 times a day, each
    time for 30 minutes. The prisoners could to use the bathroom, take
    showers, and wash their dishes and clothes only during these intervals
    until the doors were locked again. She was transferred from this section
    later in the summer. She never returned. Trial Ms. Hajmohammadi was tried
    and condemned to imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of
    the trials that led to the execution of Ms. Hajmohammadi and thousands of
    other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing
    information, there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney
    and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Hajmohammadi’s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting
    the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had
    collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes
    with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are
    false considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced
    most difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once
    every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone
    from behind the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the
    outside world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the
    truth of our claim.” Judgment The details regarding the execution sentence
    are not available. Ms. Hajmohammadi was hanged in August 1988. Months
    after the executions, prison authorities informed the families about the
    executions and handed in the victims’
