    Information about Mr. Reza Forutan was gathered from an electronic form
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with this case. The
    Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information regarding the
    1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families,
    as well as from the Bidaran website. * Mr. Reza Forutan was born in Shiraz
    in 1960. He was a high school graduate and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guidelines. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary, and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam to be their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to
    recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution
    and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic s leaders. ** Arrest and Detention Mr.
    Reza Forutan was arrested at Khazaneh Terminal in Tehran in 1979. No
    specific information is available on his arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Reza Forutan s trial. According to the
    testimonies of some of the political prisoners who were tried during the
    executions of the summer of 1988 in Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the
    trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the prison after a few
    weeks of isolation during which prisoners were deprived of visitation,
    television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and
    September, a three-member delegation composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the
    prosecutor, Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge, and Hojatoleslam
    Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry of Information asked
    prisoners questions about their views regarding the Mojahedin, whether
    they would renounce their beliefs, and if they were ready to cooperate
    against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the prisoners would
    have been charged with counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam, [what?] or to have been associated with military action or
    with various [opposition] groups based near the borders, for which they
    would be sentenced to death. The authorities never informed prisoners
    about the delegation s purpose, nor the very serious implications of their
    responses. During the summer of 1988, according to survivors, a large
    number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or leftist groups were
    executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    the Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or which they had already completed when they were retried and sentenced
    to death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims
    of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988) and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against the
    prisoners accusations that may have led to their executions. These
    accusations include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An edict of the Leader
    of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed pri
