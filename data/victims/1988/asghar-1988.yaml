    Information about Mr. Asghar Mohammadi Khabazan was gathered from an
    electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a relative and the
    list of 1988 victims by the Committee for Human Rights in Iran-Sweden. Mr.
    Asghar Mohammadi Khabazan is also listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were
    reported by the organization in a book titled Crime Against Humanity . He
    is also one of 1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission s
    Special Representative s Report published on January 26, 1989. The
    Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information regarding the
    1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from the
    human rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims
    families, as well as the Bidaran website. * According to the Committee for
    Human Rights in Iran-Sweden, Mr. Asghar Mohammadi Khabazan was born in
    Tehran. He was a high school graduate and sympathizer of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary,
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released, along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and to recruit new members, based on
    Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the
    Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini
    and supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene
    and infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. ** Arrest and Detention According to the electronic form, Mr.
    Asghar Mohammadi Khabazan, only 17 years old at the time, was selling
    newspapers when arrested. He was denied the right to access an attorney
    during his detention. No further information is available on his arrest
    and detention. International laws have strictly prohibited capital
    punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offense committed before the
    age of eighteen. Trial According to the electronic form, a court had tried
    and condemned Mr. Asghar Mohammadi Khabazan to a prison term. No
    information is available about his second trial. According to the
    testimonies of some of the political prisoners, who were tried during the
    executions of the summer of 1988 in Gohardasht and Evin prisons. The
    trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the prison after a few
    weeks of isolation, during which prisoners were deprived of visitation,
    television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and
    September, a three-member delegation composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the
    prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge; and Hojatoleslam
    Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry of Information asked
    prisoners questions about their views on the Mojahedin, whether they would
    renounce their beliefs and if they were ready to cooperate against the
    Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the prisoners would have been
    charged with counter-revolutionary, anti-religion and anti-Islam, or,
    associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders, and would be sentenced to death. The authorities never
    informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious
    implications of their responses. During the summer of 1988, according to
    survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing with Mojahedin or
    Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then-Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is pr
