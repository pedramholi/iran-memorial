    Information about Mr. Bijan Bazargan, son of Ghazanfar, was gathered from
    an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by his sister. He is
    one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission's Special
    Representative Report, "Names and particulars of persons allegedly
    executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the period July-December
    1988," published January 26, 1989. He was a victim of the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The Boroumand Foundation has collected
    additional information regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from Human Rights organizations, interviews
    with the witnesses and victims families, as well as from the Bidaran
    website. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Mr. Bijan Bazargan was single and born in Quchan in 1959.
    He graduated from high school when he was 16 and went to England to
    continue his education in medicine. In London, he joined the Iranian
    student movement, was active in the Confederation of Iranian Students, and
    was a sympathizer of the Ettehadieh Komonist-ha (communists union). After
    the revolution, Mr. Bazargan returned to Iran and, after taking the
    general university entry exam, was accepted at the School of Allied
    Medical Sciences, majoring in Industrial Health. After the Cultural
    Revolution and the closure of all universities, he was forced to stay
    home. The Ettehadieh Komonist-ha was created by exiled opponents of the
    Pahlavi regime, who mostly belonged to the Student Confederation. They
    followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung but did not believe in guerilla
    warfare. The group became marked by ideological divisions during the
    periods preceding and following the 1979 revolution, which caused it to
    split into several factions. One of the most important rifts was triggered
    by the decision of a number of members to take up arms and take over a
    city in Iran. The uprising plan, devised in the midst of an active and
    violent anti-communist campaign of the revolutionary Islamic government,
    split the Ettehadieh in two factions: one believed in the armed movement
    and the other opposed it. In the winter of 1982, armed members of the
    Ettehadieh hid in a forest in the north of Iran ( Jangal in Farsi) outside
    the city of Amol. This group, also known as the Jangal group, was involved
    in several clashes with the Revolutionary guards and, ultimately, on
    January 26, attacked the city of Amol, hoping to generate a general
    uprising. The attempt to seize Amol failed. It is reported that a number
    of the group s members, revolutionary guards, and civilians were killed
    during the Amol clash. Subsequently, members of the Ettehadieh, including
    those who opposed the Amol uprising, were arrested and tried for belonging
    to the organization and for having participated in the Amol clash. Mr.
    Bazargan s sister remembers him as a patriotic and disciplined person and
    recalls his life before detention as following: Bijan always had plans in
    his life. He would wake up at a certain time in the morning and exercise.
    Then he would read for hours and make notes or play chess. Every evening
    at 5:00, he would go to the kitchen, taking some fruit, and sat with us in
    front of TV to watch cartoons. He loved the Pink Panther cartoon. This was
    his only break. He would return to his room, continuing his reading.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Bijan Bazargan was arrested at a rendezvous with
    an arrested comrade at Falake-Aval in Ariashahr, Tehran, on a July
    afternoon in 1982. In spite of his family s efforts to receive any news of
    him by going to various official institutions, authorities kept them
    uninformed of his arrest for four months. Afterwards, he had a monthly
    visitation with his parents. Mr. Bazargan was detained at Evin and
    Gohardasht prisons. He was denied access to an attorney. Trial According
    to his sister, Mr. Bazargan was selling the Ettehadieh Komonist-ha
    newspaper and distributing its pamphlets, when this organization was legal
    and had official authorization for its newspaper. His first trial took
    place in Tehran, two years after his arrest. He was blindfolded, had no
    attorney, and had no opportunity to defend himself. The court condemned
    him to ten years imprisonment. Mr. Bazargan was upset for being arrested
    at 23 and condemned to such a heavy sentence. Efforts of his family to
    appeal the case were futile. Specific details about the circumstances of
    the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Bijan Bazargan are unknown.
    According to the testimonies of leftist political prisoners who were tried
    in Evin and Gohardasht Prisons during the executions of the summer of
    1988. The trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the
