    Mr. Mohammad Reza (Mehrdad) Beglari, son Mohammad Ali and Shahrbanu, is a
    victim of the 1988 massacre of political prisoners in Iran. The majority
    of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO).* Other victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Additional
    information about Mr. Beglari has been sent to Omid by his friends.
    According to the form provided by his friends, Mr. Beglari was born on
    October 1, 1956 in Lahijan (Gilan province) and was the second child in a
    prominent family. He was a Muslim, a husband, and a father. He was a
    well-known soccer player in the northern province of Gilan. He obtained a
    high school diploma in mathematics. He was enrolled in Tehran’s School of
    Physical Education. He lived in Lahijan when school was not in session. He
    was kind and friendly. He loved helping people in any way he could. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Beglari was arrested on July 31, 1986 at his workplace
    in Lahijan without an arrest warrant. Two men took him to the
    Revolutionary Guards building in Lahijan for him to “answer a few
    questions.” Based on the information available, he was tortured and signs
    of bastinado were seen on the soles of his feet and on his back. His first
    visit took place months after his arrest. He had several visits that were
    monitored by prison authorities. One or two times, his family members or a
    friend saw him by accident, in clinic, guarded by prison authorities. He
    was imprisoned at the Malek Ashtar Prison, which held political prisoners.
    Although Mr. Beglari was a Muslim, he did not practice Islam. But in
    prison, he was forced to practice Islam. Trial Mr. Beglari was tried
    twice. The first time, he was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Lahijan on April 20, 1987. The religious judge sentenced him to two years
    in prison. His sentence would have been completed on April 7, 1989.
    However, he was retried on July 30, 1988. Mr. Beglari’s second trial took
    place in the midst of the mass execution of political prisoners in the
    summer of 1988. According to existing information, there was no official
    trial, nor were there attorneys or prosecutors. Those who were executed in
    1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor
    from Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions
    about their beliefs, such as whether or not they believed in God. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges At the first trial, Mr. Beglari was charged
    with “sympathizing with the Hypocrites.” (Hypocrite is a term that Iranian
    officials use to refer to the MKO.) At the second trial, he was charged
    with “affiliation with the terrorist organization of the Hypocrites; his
    expressed leaning [toward the Hypocrites]; announcing that he is an
    apostate; helping espionage activities of the enemies of the Islamic
    Revolution.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah
    Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, refers to members of the MKO as “hypocrites” who do not believe
    in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that prisoners who still
    approve of the positions taken by this organization are also “waging war
    against God” and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt Based on
    information available, some persons provided false testimonies against Mr.
    Beglari. The names of these individuals are not known. Prior to Mr.
    Beglari’s arrest, a guerrilla fighter, who was affiliated with the MKO and
    a fugitive at the time, threatened Mr. Beglari with a gun and forced him
    to shelter this fugitive in his house for one night. Mr. Beglari was
    afraid of this fugitive, and fearing retaliation, he did not say anything
    about this incident to state officials or to his own family. The MKO
    fugitive was believed to have been responsible for the assassination of a
    former prosecutor from Gilan Province. According to his friends, Mr.
    Beglari did not know this person. None of his friends or relatives knew
    this individual either. State officials later found out about this
    incident and used it agai
