    Information about Ms. Leila Hajian (HajianNejad) or (Hajian Jat) has been
    drawn from an electronic form sent to Omid by her former cellmate. Ms.
    Hajian is among 3208 members and sympathizers of the People's Mojahedin of
    Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was reported by the organization
    in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book documents the
    1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. Information about the mass
    executions has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir
    of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews
    with victims families, and witnesses memoirs. At the time of arrest, Ms.
    Hajian was a high school student. Her cellmate remembers her as kind and
    patient, and very intelligent. Arrest and detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant s arrest and detention. She was denied the
    right to be represented by an attorney or to have access to her file. At
    the time of execution, she had been in prison for 7 years. Ms. Hajian was
    detained in Qezelhesar prison for several years. In 1986, when all
    political prisoners were transferred from there, she was taken to Evin
    prison. In 1987, she was transferred to Gohardasht prison as a punishment.
    She was in section 3 of ward 1 of Gohardast from the autumn of 1987 to the
    summer of 1988. As a section used for punishment , the conditions there
    were particularly difficult. The doors to the rooms were always locked and
    would be open only 3 times a day, each time for 30 minutes. The prisoners
    could to use the bathroom, take showers, and wash their dishes and clothes
    only during these intervals until the doors were locked again. In the
    summer of 1988, Ms. Hajian was transferred from this unit and never
    returned. Trial Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that
    led to the execution of Ms. Hajian and thousands of other individuals in
    1988 are not known. According to existing information, there was no
    official trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who
    were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being
    associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as hypocrites who do
    not believe in Islam and wage war against God and decrees that prisoners
    who still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also
    waging war against God and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Ms. Hajian s defense. In their open letter, the families of
    the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that
    these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed
    members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed forces of the
    Islamic Republic, states that such claims are false considering the
    circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most difficult conditions
    [in prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15 days, each visitation
    lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind the glass window, and
    were deprived of any connection with the outside world. We faced such
    conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of our claim. Judgment
    No verdict was publicly issued. Ms. Leila Hajian was hanged in July/August
    1988.
