    Mr. Hassan Shokrollahian Cheshmeh, son of Hossein, is among 3,208 members
    and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was drawn from an interview with an individual
    close to him, the Bidaran website, and an electronic form sent to Omid by
    the interviewee. Mr. Shokrollahian was born in Tehran in 1961. He was a
    high school graduate majoring in natural sciences. He was a
    Non-commissioned Officer of the Army, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. He reportedly became closer to the Organization while
    in prison. After Mr. Shokrollahian’s execution, his relatives submitted
    protest letters to international human rights organizations urging them to
    find out why he was killed and where he was buried. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Shokrollahian was arrested in February 1986 in Tehran by the
    Revolutionary Guards, who claimed that he was arrested for helping two
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization hide in his house overnight.
    The Revolutionary Guards, who had watched his house for a week, arrested
    him after arresting the two Mojahedin members. Before his trial, he was
    detained at the Joint Committee [of ?], and later at Evin prison for two
    and a half years. Mr. Shokollahian’s first visitation with his family took
    place 6 months after his arrest. Based on the available information, he
    had become very thin and looked very pale; signs of torture could be seen
    on his left temple and eye. A cellmate, who was a doctor, states that the
    blood vessels and muscles of his left eye had been damaged and the proper
    medical facilities to operate on them did not exist in Iran. Trial Mr.
    Shokrollahian had been denied access to his file and did not have an
    attorney. In a first trial he was condemned to 5 years imprisonment. He
    was denied the right to appeal. Specific details on the circumstances of
    the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Shokrollahian and thousands of
    other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing
    information, there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney
    and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges According
    to the available information, Mr. Shokrollahian was charged as a
    “hypocrite” (a name used by the regime to refer to the members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization). No charge has been publicly leveled against
    the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities’
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being “counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced
    in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor,
    corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against the
    executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the
    Mojahedin members as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage
    war against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the
    positions taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and
    should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available regarding the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense
    In their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants
    were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerillas operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: “Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed during the past seven
    years that they were denied access to anything that would
