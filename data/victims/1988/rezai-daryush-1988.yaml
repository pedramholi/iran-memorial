    Serious in front of a camera, Mr. Reza i was known for his good humor. A
    neighbor denounced him during the Iran-Iraq war for listening to the
    radio. Mr. Daryush Reza i, son of Mansur, was a victim of the mass
    killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Other
    victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Information about
    the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the
    memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations,
    interviews with victims families, and witnesses memoirs. Information about
    Mr. Reza i, a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, has been
    drawn from an electronic form and an interview with an individual familiar
    with this case. Mr. Reza i s name is also mentioned in the book 67
    Massacre by Mr. Mas ud Ansari, and the book Crime Against Humanity of the
    MKO. Mr. Reza i was born in 1966 in Kermanshah. The interviewee remembers
    Mr. Reza i as intelligent and positive, with a good sense of humor. Mr.
    Reza i was first arrested violently in the winter of 1982 at the age of 15
    by armed officers. He was transferred to the Ministry of Intelligence. He
    was kept incommunicado and his family was unaware of his whereabouts for
    several months. Only after trial and condemnation to a two year
    imprisonment was his family allowed to visit him in prison. They observed
    he had lost weight and walked with difficulty. During these months he was
    severely tortured to that extent that for a long time after his release
    from prison in 1984, he was under doctor s attention for back pain and had
    to go to Tehran for treatment. According to the interviewee, he became a
    more serious sympathizer of the MKO during his imprisonment. In 1984 he
    joined the army for compulsory military service but he escaped after some
    time. When government agents attempted to arrest him for a second time in
    1985, he became a fugitive. Arrest and detention In 1986, Mr. Reza i s
    house was ambushed by armed men and he was arrested for a second time,
    held and tortured for one month. In 1988 he escaped prison but was
    arrested for a third time near the border of Kurdestan in Iraq. He was
    transferred to Tehran province to either Evin or Gohardasht prison. Trial
    Specific details on the circumstances of his trials are not known. After
    his escape from prison, Mr. Reza i was condemned to imprisonment (probably
    life imprisonment). According to the available information, Iranian
    authorities did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court
    with the presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in
    1988 had been questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of
    a religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the
    Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about
    their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges Mr. Daryush Reza i was first arrested in 1982 and charged
    with reading or possession of the MKO publications. Prior to his second
    arrest in 1986 he was observed listening to the radio by an individual who
    concluded that he was a spy informing the Iraqi enemies (during the
    Iran-Iraq war) of the locations to be bombed through a wireless
    transmitter. This individual reported Mr. Reza i to the authorities. In
    1988 he was arrested for a third time, near the Iran-Iraq border, having
    escaped prison. The charges that led to his execution are not known.
    According to the available information, no charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities' accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding
