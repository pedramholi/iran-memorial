    Information about Mr. Ahmad Mirza i-Alavicheh was gathered from two
    electronic forms sent to the Boroumand Foundation by two persons familiar
    with this case. Mr. Ahmad Mirza i-Alavicheh is also listed among 3,208
    members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose
    executions were reported by the organization in a book titled Crime
    Against Humanity . He is also one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission Special Representative s Report, published on January
    26, 1989. The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information
    regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri,
    reports from human rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and
    victims families, as well as from the Bidaran website. * Mr. Ahmad Mirza
    i-Alavicheh, son of Ali, was born into a religious family in Esfahan in
    1958. He was a high school graduate and a professional. He was a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and distributed
    publications and photos for the organization. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released,
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and to recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic s leaders. ** Arrest and Detention
    According to one electronic form, Mr. Ahmad Mirza i-Alavicheh was arrested
    for distributing photos and publications in a public bath. No specific
    information is available on his arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on Mr. Ahmad Mirza i-Alavicheh s trial. According to the
    testimonies of some of the political prisoners who were tried during the
    executions of the summer of 1988 in Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the
    trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the prison, after a few
    weeks of isolation, during which prisoners were deprived of visitation,
    television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and
    September, a three-member delegation composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the
    prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge; and Hojatoleslam
    Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry of Information, asked
    prisoners questions about their views concerning the Mojahedin, whether
    they would renounce their beliefs, and if they were ready to cooperate
    against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the prisoners would
    have been charged with counter revolutionary, anti-religion and
    anti-Islam, or associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders, and would be sentenced to
    death. The authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s
    purpose and the serious implications of their responses. During the summer
    of 1988, according to survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing
    with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their
    beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then-Minister of Justice,
    Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges According to one electronic form,
    the charge against Mr. Ahmad Mirza i-Alavicheh was announced as,
    revolutionary activity. No charge has been publicly leveled against the
    victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of
