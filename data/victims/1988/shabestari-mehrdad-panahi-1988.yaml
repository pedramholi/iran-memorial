    Mr. Mehrdad Panahi Shabestari is one of the victims in the mass killings
    of political prisoners in 1988. Many of the executed prisoners were
    members or sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Other
    victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Information about
    the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the
    memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations,
    interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs. His name is
    also included in the UN Human Rights Commission’s Special Representative’s
    Report, “Names and particulars of persons allegedly executed by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran during the period July-December 1988,” published
    in 1989. Additional information about Mr. Mehrdad Panahi Shabestari is
    taken from an interview with a person close to him. Born in 1955, he was a
    student in the Business College and a sympathizer of the Fadayian Khalq
    Organization (Minority). The Fadayian Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist-Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over the question
    of support to the Islamic Republic and to the Soviet Union. The Fadayian
    Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was primarily active in
    the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Mehrdad Panahi was arrested by the Public Prosecutor Office of Evin Prison
    on the street while waiting for somebody for a meeting, in Tehran on
    December 23, 1983. He was detained at Evin prison for five years. Trial
    Mr. Mehrdad Panahi was tried at Evin Prison and condemned to five years
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Panahi Shabestari and thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney and
    prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges According
    to the interviewee, the charge against Mr. Mehrdad Panahi in his first
    trial was “membership of the Fadayian Khalq Organization (Minority).” No
    charge was ever publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass
    execution. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the accusations against the prisoners that may have led
    to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Defendants, who did not belong to the MKO may have been accused of being
    “anti-religion” for not having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence provided against
    the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves
    in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with
    guerrilla forces operating near the borders, the families submit the
    isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention: “Our
    children lived under most difficult conditions. All visits were limited to
