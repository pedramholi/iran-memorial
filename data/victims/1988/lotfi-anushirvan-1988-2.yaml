    The former regime condemned him severely for his opposition. In its turn,
    the Islamic Republic rained at least ten separate accusations down on him,
    some quite abstract. The information about Mr. Anushirvan Lotfi is based
    on an interview with a person close to him. His execution, along with that
    two other individuals, was also reported in the Ettela at newspaper on May
    29, 1988. Mr. Anushirvan Lotfi was born in 1949. He was a student in the
    Technical School of Tehran University. He got married in 1981 and his
    daughter, Khatereh, was born at Evin prison. He was a member of the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Majority). Under the previous regime, he was
    arrested and condemned to life imprisonment. He was released after the
    Revolution. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group,
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin
    America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the Organization, which had
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority considered the
    Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime and
    supported it. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic
    targeted its members solely because of their political beliefs. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Anushirvan Lotfi was arrested on the road from the north to
    Tehran in August, 1983. He was detained at the Revolutionary Committee and
    later at Evin prison. He had 3 or 4 visitations with his mother, two
    visitations with his wife and one visitation with his in-laws. No
    information is available about the right to be represented by an attorney.

    was tried by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran. Charges Public
