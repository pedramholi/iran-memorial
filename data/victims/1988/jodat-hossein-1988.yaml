    Mr. Hossein Jodat is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission’s Special Representative’s Report, “Names and Particulars of
    Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran from
    July-December 1988,” published January 26, 1989. The report specifies that
    although 1,000 names are mentioned, “in all probability” there were
    several thousand victims. “Most of the alleged victims were members of the
    Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People’s Fedaiyan
    Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs were
    also said to be among the alleged victims.” The additional information
    about Mr. Hossein Jodat is taken from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh
    Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party publications. He was born in Tabriz in
    1910. He had a PhD in Physics from a university in France and served as a
    professor at Tehran University for a while. In 1948, he became a member of
    the Central Committee of the Tudeh Party. He was a member of the Executive
    Board of the Party until the day he was arrested. After the assassination
    attempt against Shah in 1948, he was arrested and condemned to five years
    imprisonment. In 1950, along with some other leaders of the Tudeh Party,
    he escaped the Qasr prison. In 1956, he moved out of the country, to
    return after the Revolution. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941.
    The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of
    the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran’s political
    scene until it was banned for the second time following the August 19,
    1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah
    Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party leaders and members were
    imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Hossein Jodat was arrested in May,
    1982. Trial Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Jodat and thousands of other individuals in 1988
    are not known. According to existing information, there was no official
    trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were
    executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge was publicly leveled
    against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the
    Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities’
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being “counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the Mojahedin Khalq members as
    “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and
    decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this
    organization are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to
    death. It is possible that the prisoners who were members of organizations
    other than the Mojahedin Khalq were charge for being “anti religious” and
    were condemned for insisting on their beliefs. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves
    in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with
    guerrilla forces operating near the borders, the families submit the
    isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention: “Our
    children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10
    minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone eve
