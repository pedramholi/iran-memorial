    The information about Ms. Simin (Kheyrieh) Safa i, daughter of Qorban ali,
    was gathered from an electronic form and other documents sent to the
    Boroumand Foundation by a person close to her. Ms. Safa i is also listed
    among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization,
    whose executions were reported by the organization in a book entitled
    Crime Against Humanity . She is also one of 1,000 people identified in a
    UN Human Rights Commission s Special Representative s Report published on
    January 26, 1989. The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional
    information regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports from the Human Rights organizations, interviews with
    the witnesses and victims families as well as from the Bidaran website.
    [*] Ms. Safa i was born in Abadan on October 25, 1957. After graduating
    from high school, she completed a professional teaching training and
    earned her associate degree. After the Iran/Iraq war began, she moved
    along with her family to Tehran where she taught at a school in Yaftabad
    and made contact with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. According to the
    electronic form, she was very kind and had a smile all the time. She was
    also very helpful to others. She liked reading books and having a simple
    life style. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    s leaders. [**] Arrest and detention According to the electronic form, Ms.
    Safa i was arrested in a team house of Mojahedin Khalq in the fall of
    1981. She was in her relatives houses for awhile but in order to avoid any
    trouble for them, she then moved out to a Mojahedin house. She was
    detained at Qezelhesar, Gohardasht, Mashhad, and Evin (Section 209 and
    Unit 3 of Section 7) prisons. She wrote several letters to her family from
    prison. She had monthly visitations with her family while in the Evin and
    Gohardasht prisons. During these visitations, she demonstrated good
    morale, consoled her family, and expressed hope to be together again.
    During one of her last visitations at the Evin Prison, in response to her
    mother s question of why she was still imprisoned when her sentence period
    was over, she replied: They want me to cooperate with those who repented
    and participate in interviews to be released. I will not interview. I will
    not betray my friends. Do you want me to do this? Be patient. God is
    great. Trial According to the electronic form, Ms. Safa i had been
    condemned to seven years imprisonment during her first trial. She informed
    her family of this sentence during a visitation. However, she was still
    imprisoned several months after her sentence was over. No information is
    available on her second trial. According to the testimonies of some of the
    political prisoners who were tried during the executions of the summer of
    1988 in Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the trials took place in a room on
    the ground floor of the prison after a few weeks of isolation during which
    prisoners were deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts,
    and outdoor time. In August and September, a three-member delegation
    composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor, Hojatoleslam Nayyeri,
    the religious judge, and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of
    the Ministry of Information, asked prisoners questions about their views
    on Mojahedin, whether they would renounce their beliefs and if they were
    ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were,
    the prisoners would have be
