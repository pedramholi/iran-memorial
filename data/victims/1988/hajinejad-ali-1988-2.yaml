    Mr. Ali Hajinejad is one of 1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and particulars of
    persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the
    period July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, "in all probability"
    there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were
    members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's
    Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims." Mr. Ali Hajinejad is also
    listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the People's Mojahedin of
    Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was reported by the organization
    in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity. This book documents the 1988-89
    mass execution of political prisoners. Additional information was drawn
    from the Bidaran and PMIO websites. Mr. Ali Hajinejad was born in Makan, a
    village close to Khoy. He was a college student, majoring in mathematics
    and was a PMIO sympathizer. He lost two brothers who were also PMIO
    sympathizers. The first one, Ahad, was killed during a fight with the
    Revolutionary Guards in the Tajrish square in Tehran on January 30, 1982.
    The second, Samad, was killed in a Mojahedin base on August 1, 1982.
    Arrest and detention According to the PMIO website, Mr. Hajinejad was
    arrested in the Enqelab square in Tehran in November 1981 and detained for
    seven years. His whereabouts during the first year of his imprisonment are
    still unknown. Afterwards, he was transferred to the Qezelhesar and then
    the Evin prisons where he had several visits with his family. In February,
    1984, he was transferred to the Gohardasht prison, and after a month, he
    was denied any visitation. In November, 1985, his mother was allowed to
    visit him. But, in 1988 he was again denied any visitation. There was no
    news of him from that time until his execution. According to the PMIO
    website, after nine months without any visitation, prison officials told
    his mother that "we haven t made a human out of him yet!" and responding
    to the question of whether they had killed him or not, the officials said
    "maybe". His sister describes his visit with his mother in 1985: The marks
    of torture were all over his body. He couldn't walk. He had lost his hair.
    He stared at his mother blankly and couldn't talk properly. He told his
    mother that he has been in solitary confinement for nine months and he was
    interrogated and tortured there. He tried to commit suicide several times,
    but they [the prison authorities] saved him each time. Trial Mr. Hajinejad
    was tried and convicted to a prison term. There is no specific information
    about the trial. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988
    refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of
    executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of
    Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed serving at the
    time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly levelled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who
    do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defence No information is available about
    the defendant s defence. In their open letter, the families of the
    prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend
    themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated
    with guerrillas operating near the borders, the families submit the
    isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our
    children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10
    minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We
