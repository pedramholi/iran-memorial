    Information about Mr. Hossein Barani was gathered from an electronic form
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with this case. Mr.
    Hossein Barani is also listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were reported by the
    organization in a book titled Crime Against Humanity . He is also one of
    1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission Special
    Representative s Report, published on January 26, 1989. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families,
    as well as from the Bidaran website. * According to the electronic form,
    Mr. Barani was born in Gonaveh (Bushehr province). He had a bachelor s
    degree in civil engineering and was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. He was a candidate, supported by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, at the first parliamentary elections. He was the interim
    mayor of Gonaveh for a short time. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as
    its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam
    was revolutionary, and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members, based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic s leaders. ** Arrest and Detention Mr. Barani was
    arrested in 1981. No other information is available about his arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available regarding Mr. Hossein Barani
    s trial. According to the testimonies of some of the political prisoners
    who were tried during the executions of the summer of 1988 in Gohardasht
    and Evin prisons, the trials took place in a room on the ground floor of
    the prison after a few weeks of isolation during which prisoners were
    deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time.
    In August and September, a three-member delegation composed of
    Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor, Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious
    judge, and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, representative of the Ministry of
    Information asked prisoners questions about their views concerning the
    Mojahedin, whether they would renounce their beliefs, and if they were
    ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were,
    the prisoners would have been charged with counter- revolutionary,
    anti-religion and anti-Islam or associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders and would be sentenced
    to death. The authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s
    purpose and the serious implications of their responses. During the summer
    of 1988, according to survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing
    with the Mojahedin or leftist groups were executed for not recanting their
    beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners - executed in 1988 - refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to the Minister of Justice at
    the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding
    these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an
    overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to
    prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed when
    they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their
    letters to the Minister of Justice (1988) and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the pri
