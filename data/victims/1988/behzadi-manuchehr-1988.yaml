    Mr. Manuchehr Behzadi is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and
    Particulars of Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    during the period July-December 1988," published on January 26, 1989. The
    report specifies that although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all
    probability" there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged
    victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh
    Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization and eleven mullahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims." The additional information about Mr. Manuchehr Behzadi is taken
    from the book "The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran" by the Tudeh Party
    Publications. He was born in Tehran on December 7, 1927. He had a PhD in
    economics. He joined the Youth Organization of the Tudeh Party in 1941 and
    was given responsibility of a district in 1948. He wrote articles in the
    Razm and Mardom newspapers. In 1955, he left Iran, but later, he became a
    member of the Political Bureau of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran
    was created in 1941. The Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it
    supported the former Soviet Union's policies. The Party played a major
    role on Iran's political scene until it was banned following the August
    19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party actively supported the
    Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic. Although the Party never
    opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of government attacks
    in 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned.
    Arrest and detention According to the above book, Mr. Manuchehr Behzadi
    was arrested in 1983 and transferred to Evin prison. According to one of
    his cellmates, he was deprived from sleep for sixteen consecutive days. As
    a result, he had psychological problems. He was imprisoned for five years
    before his execution. Trial According to the available information, the
    Iranian authorities did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in
    a court with in the presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were
    executed in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member special committee,
    composed of a religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence
    Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist
    prisoners about their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving at the time they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    levelled against the victims of the 1988 mass execution. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    government’s accusations against the prisoners -- accusations that may
    have led to their execution – as being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced
    in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor,
    corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against the
    executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the
    Tudeh's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war
    against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. It is possible that the prisoners who belonged to
    groups other than the Mojahedin Khalq Organization were convicted for
    being “anti-religious”, defending their opinion, and refusing to repent.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families
    of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were
    associated with guerrilla troops operating near the borders, the families
    submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside during their
    detention: "Our children lived under most difficult conditions. Visits
    were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone
    every two weeks. Over the past seven years we witnessed that they were
    denied access to anything that would have allowed them to establish
    contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such conditions the famili
