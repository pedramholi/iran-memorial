    Mr. Hossein Lame i, son of Ali, is one of the victims in the mass killings
    of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners
    were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Other victims
    included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such
    as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which
    opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan
    Khalq (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has
    been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims
    families, and witnesses memoirs. The information about Mr. Lame i is taken
    from an electronic form that a relative has sent to Omid, as well as the
    book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party
    publications. Mr. Lame i was born in Behshahr on September 11, 1957. He
    worked as a lathe operator in Tehran (electronic form). He was a member of
    the Tudeh Party of Iran (Tudeh book). The Tudeh Party of Iran was created
    in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported
    policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in
    Irans political scene until it was banned for the second time following
    the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party leaders and members were
    imprisoned. Arrest and detention The details of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Mr. Lame i was arrested in a November morning
    in 1986 in Tehran (electronic form). He was kept in Evin prison (Tudeh
    book). Trial Mr. Lame i was tried and condemned to four years
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Lame i and thousands of other individuals in 1988
    are not known. According to existing information, there was no official
    trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were
    executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges At the first trial, the charges
    against Mr. Lame i have been reported as: membership of the Tudeh party,
    cancelling organizational meeting and only then informing the
    interrogators of them, attempting to resume activities of the Tudeh party
    (electronic form). No charge has been publicly levelled against the
    victims of the 1988 massacre. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988) and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against the
    prisoners, which may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as
    well as being associated with military action or with various [opposition]
    groups based near the borders. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic
    Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the
    MKO members as hypocrites who do not believe in Islam and wage war against
    God and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by
    this organization are also waging war against God and should be sentenced
    to death. It is possible that the prisoners who were members of
    organizations other than the Mojahedin Khalq were charge for being
    anti-religion and were condemned for insisting on their beliefs. Evidence
    of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families of the
    prisoners noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend
    themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that these
    prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed members of
    the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic
    Republic, states that such claims are false con
