    The information about Mr. Mohammad Ja’far Vosuqi is based on an interview
    with his wife. His name is also mentioned in the list “Yadnameh”,
    published by the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, Majority Branch (April 2002:
    Koln). Mr. Vosuqi is one victim of the 1988-89 mass execution of political
    prisoners in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The majority of the executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims
    included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such
    as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which
    opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan
    Khalq (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has
    been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Mr. Vosuqi was born in Qazvin in 1957.
    He was graduated from the National University with a degree in biology; he
    worked as a specialist in a pharmaceutical company. He was married and a
    member of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Majority). In a letter to the
    Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva,
    Switzerland, his wife, Fariba Kaviani, protested her husband’s execution.
    The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 Revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority considered the Islamic Republic
    as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime and supported it. After the
    spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely
    because of their political beliefs. Arrest and detention Mr. Vosuqi was
    arrested by plainclothes agents in his house in Tehran on July 11, 1987.
    The agents had a warrant signed by the Public Prosecution Office for
    Narcotics. Mr. Vosuqi’s wife, who was also arrested, explained the arrest
    circumstances as follows: “Around midnight, some armed agents jumped over
    the walls and entered our house. They showed us a narcotics-related
    warrant. Our landlord, who lived next door, told them that he knows us and
    assured them that we are not related to narcotics. My sister’s name was
    written on the warrant instead of mine. I told them that it must be a
    mistake. They said, ‘it may be so, but you should come with us and after a
    few questions we will take you back.’ I had to leave my two-year-old son
    with the neighbors and got in their car along with my husband. They forced
    us to lay our heads on our legs and took us to a building that later on I
    realized was the Intelligence Committee building. In the parking lot, they
    blindfolded us, took us to the yard, and separated us. Then the
    interrogations began.” The circumstances of Mr. Vosuqi’s detention are not
    known. But his wife, who was also a political activist and released later,
    was tortured severely. She wrote to the Boroumand Foundation that she was
    blindfolded in prison and that agents hit the soles of her feet with a
    metal rod. They tortured and interrogated her for several days until they
    had to take her to the Revolutionary Guard’s hospital. She added, “During
    the interrogations, the interrogator demanded that I write the following
    statement after each of my answers: ‘Anytime, if it becomes evident that I
    did not tell the truth, the Islamic Republic has the right to execute me.’
    I had to sign the statement.” Mr. Mohammad Ja’far Vosuqi was detained at
    the Joint Committee, the Revolutionary Guard’s prison in Mashhad, and Evin
    prison. According to his wife, they took them both separately to Mashhad
    because their political activities took place in that city. She had two
    visitations with Mr. Vosuqi, once at Mashhad prison and the other time at
    Evin for ten minutes. According to her, Mr. Vosuqi was denied the right to
    have an attorney. Trial Specific details on the circumstances of the
    trials that led to the execution of Mr. Mohammad Ja’far Vosuqi and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of
    the 1988 mass execution in a court with the presence of a defence lawyer.
    The prisoners executed in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member
    special committee composed of a religious judge, a representative of the
    Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned
    the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and their faith in God and
    religion. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy su
