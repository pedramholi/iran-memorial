    Ms. Roqieh (Mansureh) Sa'adati is listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose
    execution was reported by the Organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity . This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran
    website and the PMIO website. She was born in Shiraz. She was a school
    teacher. She was arrested on June 20, 1981 and detained until the end of
    the year. Her two brothers, who were also PMIO sympathizers, were executed
    by firing squads. Mohammadreza Sa'adati was executed during August, 1981
    and Hesam Sa'adati was executed during the winter of 1984. The
    demonstrations on June 20, 1981, were in protest of the parliament's
    impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic's policy of
    systematically excluding the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) from the
    country's political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with
    MKO leaders and his insistence to disarm them. Until June 20, the MKO had
    supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to operate
    within the framework of the new political system. However, on June 20th,
    the MKO officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the regime by
    organizing mass demonstrations all over the country. These demonstrations,
    which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of
    demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that targeted not only
    the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized the
    months-old state harassment and suppression of dissidents resulting in the
    banning of all forms of political dissent. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    According to the MKO website, Ms. Roqieh Sa'adati was arrested for a
    second time during the winter of 1984. She was taken to Adel Abad Prison
    in Shiraz. According to the same source, she had no visitors during the
    last two months of her detention. Trial Ms. Roqyeh Sa'adati was tried and
    condemned to five years imprisonment. There is no information about the
    trial, just as there is no specific information about any such trials that
    condemned thousands of political prisoners to death in just a few months
    period. According to the available information, the Iranian authorities
    did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the
    presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had
    been questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of a
    religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the
    Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about
    their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was ever publicly levelled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the accusations that may have led to their execution.
    These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMIO's members as "hypocrites" who
    do not believe in Islam and who "wage war against God" and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this Organization
    are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to death. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available about
    her defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that
    defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court.
    Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces
    operating near the borders, the families s
