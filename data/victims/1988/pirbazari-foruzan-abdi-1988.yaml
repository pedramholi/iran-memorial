    Known to be open-minded and tolerant, she was the captain of Iran s
    national volleyball team, she knew how to organize and boost her
    colleagues morale. Ms. Foruzan Abdi Pirbazari is one of the victims of the
    1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran. Many of the executed prisoners were members or sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). However, members or supporters of
    Marxist Leninist organizations such as, the People s Fedayian of Iran
    (Minority) or Peykar, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the
    Tudeh Party and Fadayian Khalq (Majority), which did not oppose the
    regime, were among the victims. Complementary information about the mass
    execution has been gathered from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri,
    reports of human rights organizations, interviews with family members, and
    memoirs of witnesses by the Boroumand Foundation. Ms. Foruzan Abdi
    Pirbazari is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the People's
    Mojahedin of Iran Organization whose execution was reported by the
    Organization in the book Crime Against Humanity . Her name has also been
    mentioned in the list of the victims of the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners published in a November 2, 1989 United Nations Report
    of the Economic and Social Council on the Situation of human rights in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran, by Mr. Reynaldo Galindo Pohl (El Salvador),
    Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights, as well as the
    book 67 Massacre by Mr. Mas ud Ansari. Additional information was drawn
    from the Bidaran and the Mojahedin websites, a report from Monireh
    Baradaran, who was her cellmate at various periods during her imprisonment
    and another cellmate, Mina Entezari s memoirs. Ms. Abdi was born in Tehran
    in 1957. She was the captain of the National Volleyball team and a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. According to her
    cellmate, Ms. Abdi was very popular among other inmates. Her cellmates
    remember her for her open-mindedness and tolerant attitude towards other
    political prisoners. In one instance, her cellmate recalls, when a
    repenting prisoner who was in charge of the cell ordered a leftist
    prisoner to separate her dishes from the others (because prison
    authorities treated prisoners who did not believe in God as unclean ), Ms.
    Abdi had intervened and stressed that no one considers the leftist
    prisoner as unclean and whoever does, should separate her own dishes from
    others . Ms. Abdi had also kept her athletic spirits during her years of
    imprisonment and organized volleyball games during the short period when
    female prisoners had access to a volleyball court at Qezelhesar prison.
    Arrest and detention Ms. Foruzan Abdi Pirbazari was arrested in 1981. The
    MKO website quotes one of her cellmates saying: "I saw her in section 8 of
    Qezelhesar in 1982. It was a section for special punishment and sometimes
    there were 25 to 30 people in a cell [that was meant to fit 3] They placed
    Foruzan and some others in a restroom in early 1983. The place was so
    dirty that all of them contracted skin diseases. Then, they were
    transferred to solitary confinement at both Gohardasht and Qezelhesar
    prisons where they stayed until early 1986." Ms. Baradaran, who saw Abdi
    at Gohardasht prison, reports that Ms. Abdi was protesting against the
    inhuman rules and behaviour of prison guards. As a result, for almost a
    year and half (fall 1983 - winter 1984), she was held in solitary
    confinement and was deprived from recreation time outside, from having
    contacts with others, reading newspapers, and having regular visits from
    her family. Sometime in 1986, Ms. Abdi was transferred from Gohardasht to
    Evin prison where she was detained until her execution. During this
    period, she also spent most of her imprisonment in the closed section of
    the ward that prison authorities used for punishing prisoners. Those held
    in this section were held in closed cells and were allowed to leave their
    cells 3 times a day (for 30 minutes), during which time they could use the
    bathroom, wash their dishes and their clothes. Trial The details of Ms.
    Abdi s first trial, in which she was condemned to five years imprisonment,
    are not known. However, she was not released after serving her term
    because she refused the authorities terms for her release. (Authorities
    required prisoners to make a statement in front of other prisoners
    rejecting their ideas and their political groups as a condition for their
    release. Later, authorities would only require a signed statement. After
    the prison massacre of 1988, prisoners were required to sign a statement
    giving up political activities.) There is no specific information about
    the 1988 trials that condemned Ms. Abdi and thousands of other political
    prisoners to death in just a few months period. According to the available
    information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of the 1988
    mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense lawyer. The pr
