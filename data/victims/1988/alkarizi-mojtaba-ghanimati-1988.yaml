    Mr. Mojtaba Ghanimati Alkarizi is listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose
    execution was reported by the organization in a book called Crime Against
    Humanity . This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political
    prisoners. Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran and the PMIO
    websites. He was born in Tehran, a student, and a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). His sister, Fatemeh, was killed during
    an armed clash with the regime. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. There is no
    information about the date of Mr. Mojtaba Ghanimati Alkarizi’s arrest.
    Trial There is no information about this trial just as there is no
    specific information about any such trials that condemned thousands
    political prisoners to death in just a few months period. According to the
    available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of
    the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense
    lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee, composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No
    charge has ever been publicly levelled against the defendant. In their
    letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the accusations against the prisoners that may have led to their
    execution. These include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict from the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of his designated successor Ayatollah Montazeri corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMIO's members as
    "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and
    decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this
    organization are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to
    death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available about
    the defendant’s defence. In their open letter, the families of the
    prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend
    themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated
    with guerrilla forces operating near the borders, the families submit the
    isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our
    children lived in most difficult conditions. Our visits were limited to 10
    minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We
    witnessed over seven years that they were denied access to anything that
    would have allowed them to establish contacts outside their prison walls."
    Under such conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities
    that these prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside
    Iran. Judgment No specific information is available about the defendant’s
    execution. Mr. Mojtaba Ghanimati Alkarizi was hanged during the mass
    killings of the political prisoners at Evin Prison in August 1988.
