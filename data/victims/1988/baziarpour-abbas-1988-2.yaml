    Mr. Abbas Baziarpour is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) whose execution was reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book
    documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. Additional
    information was drawn from the Bidaran website and the MKO website. He was
    born in Borazjan (Bushehr province). He was a worker and a sympathizer of
    the MKO. He distributed MKO publications after work. He was arrested once
    in 1981 and released three years later. His brother, Kazem, was also
    executed in 1988. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Baziarpour’s arrest and detention are not known. The MKO website has no
    information about the date of his second arrest and only states that he
    had been to Pakistan in the winter of 1987. When, he returned to Iran, he
    was arrested. Trial Specific details on the circumstances of the trials
    that led to the execution of Mr. Baziarpour and thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney and
    prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families
    of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that
    these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed
    members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed forces of the
    Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are false considering the
    circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most difficult conditions
    [in prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15 days, each visitation
    lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind the glass window, and
    were deprived of any connection with the outside world. We faced such
    conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of our claim.” Judgment
    No specific information is available about the execution sentence.
    According to the MKO website, Mr. Abbas Baziarpour was hanged during the
    mass killings of the political prisoners in Borazjan in 1988.
