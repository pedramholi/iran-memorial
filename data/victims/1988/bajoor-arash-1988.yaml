    News of the executio of Mr. Arash Bajoor, son of Azizollah, is sent to
    Boroumand Center via an electronic form by a person close to him. His name
    is also among 3208 members and sympathizers of the People's Mojahedin of
    Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was reported by the organization
    in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity. This book documents the 1988-89
    mass execution of political prisoners. Additional information was drawn
    from the Bidaran website. He was single and was serving his compulsory
    services at the time. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded
    in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention No specific
    information is available on Mr. Bajoor's arrest and detention. Trial The
    circumstances that led to this defendant's execution are unknown. However,
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is the
    proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving at the time they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against
    the prisoners; accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims
    regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict,
    Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMIO's members as "hypocrites" who do not
    believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also "waging
    war against God" and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available regarding the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves
    in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with
    guerillas operating near the borders, the families submit the isolation of
    their relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our children
    lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes
    behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed
    during the past seven years that they were denied access to anything that
    would have allowed them to establish contacts outside their prisons'
    walls." Under such conditions the families reject the claim of the
    authorities that these prisoners were able to engage with the political
    groups outside Iran. Judgment No sentence was issued publicly. He was
    executed in Evin prison but his body was not delivered to the family nor
    were they infomred of where he was buried. ------------------------------
