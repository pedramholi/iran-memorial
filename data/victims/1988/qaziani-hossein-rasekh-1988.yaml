    Mr. Hossein Rasekh Qaziani is one of the victims in the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. The additional information about Mr.
    Hossein Rasekh Qaziani is taken from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh
    Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party publications. In previous regime, he was
    arrested and condemned to three years imprisonment for his political
    activities as a member of a Marxist group. After his release in 1974, he
    joined the Navid Organization (the underground organization of the Tudeh
    Party). After the Revolution, he was an advisor to the Central Committee
    of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh
    Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the
    former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran’s political
    scene until it was banned for the second time following the August 19,
    1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah
    Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party leaders and members were
    imprisoned. Arrest and detention The details of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Mr. Hossein Rasekh Qaziani was arrested by
    the Revolutionary Guards in his home along with three friends on April 26,
    1983. In July, 1984, he had his first visit with his wife at the Joint
    Committee prison. Trial Mr. Hossein Rasekh Qaziani was tried in 1984. But,
    no ruling was issued and he waited for his judgement until he was
    executed. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to
    the execution of Mr. Rasekh and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are
    not known. According to existing information, there was no official trial
    with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed
    in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious
    judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public
    Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some
    questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in God. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was publicly leveled against the
    victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of
    Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February
    2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities’ accusations
    against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution.
    These accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims
    regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict,
    Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the MKO members as “hypocrites” who do not
    believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also “waging
    war against God” and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves
    in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with
    guerrillas’ operating near the borders, the families submit the isolation
    of their relatives from the outside during their detention: “Our children
    lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes
    behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed,
    over the past seven years, that they were den
