    Mr. Ja'far Javidfar is one of the victims in the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. Many of the executed prisoners were members
    or sympathizers of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI, also
    known as MKO). However, members or supporters of Marxist Leninist
    organizations such as, the People’s Fedayian of Iran (Minority) or Peykar,
    which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and
    Fadayian Khalq (Majority), which did not oppose the regime, were among the
    victims. Complementary information has been gathered from the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews
    with family members, and memoirs of witnesses by the Boroumand Foundation.
    Mr. Javidfar is also one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and Particulars of
    Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran from
    July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report specifies that
    although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all probability" there were
    several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were members of the
    Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan
    Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization as well as 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims." The information about Mr.
    Ja'far Javidfar is taken from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of
    Iran by the Tudeh Party Publications. He was born in Kermanshah in 1928.
    He joined the Tudeh Party in 1944 and became a leader of the Youth
    Organization in Kermanshah in 1951. He was arrested on August 19, 1953 and
    was condemned to five years imprisonment. After being released from
    prison, he went to France and earned his PhD in Sociology from the
    Sorbonne University. After the revolution, he published several books on
    sociology and scientific geography. In 1979, he became a candidate for the
    Islamic Parliament (Majles) from Kermanshah. The Tudeh Party of Iran was
    created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it
    supported the former Soviet Union's policies. The Party played a major
    role in Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second time
    following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party
    declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention Mr. Ja'far
    Javidfar was arrested during May, 1983. He was transferred to Evin Prison.
    Trial According to the available information, the Iranian authorities did
    not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the
    presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had
    been questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of a
    religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the
    Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about
    their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. Whether or not such a
    committee also condemned him to death is not known. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was ever publicly levelled against
    the victims of the 1988 mass execution. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced
    in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor,
    corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against the
    executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's
    members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against
    God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken
    by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. It is possible that the prisoners who were members of
    organizations other than the Mojahedin Khalq were charge for being "anti
