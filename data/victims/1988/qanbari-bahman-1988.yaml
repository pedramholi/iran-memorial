    News of the execution of Mr. Bahman Qanbari, son of Esma il, was gathered
    from an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person
    familiar with his case. Additional information was collected from the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on November 13 and 19, 1983 and the book
    Shaidan-e Tudeh i published by the Tudeh Party of Iran. Information
    regarding Mr. Qanbari, an affiliate of the Tudeh Party, is also taken from
    the book Those Who Said No, published in 1999 in Paris by the Association
    for the Defense of Political Prisoners and Prisoners of Conscience in
    Iran. He was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988.
    The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information regarding
    the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from
    the Human Rights organizations, interviews with witnesses and victims
    families as well as from the Bidaran website. The majority of the executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims
    included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such
    as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which
    opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan
    Khalq (Majority), which did not. Mr. Qanbari, the third child in his
    family, was born in the Sarab-Qanbar Village in Kermanshah province. He
    was married with four children. He graduated from the Cadet College,
    became a Colonel in army ground forces, and a member of the Tudeh Party of
    Iran. In 1980 Mr. Qanbari entered the Secret Branch of the Tudeh Party of
    Iran. He had been a member of the military branch of the Fadaian Khalq
    Organization and joined the Aksariat Faction after a split occurred in
    that organization. He was in charge of finances for the organization in
    Kermanshah. His last rank in the army was the Commander of the Logistics
    and Transportation Support Battalion in Armor Division 81 in Kermanshah.
    The Tudeh Party of Iran ( Hezbe Tudeh or the Party of the Masses) was
    founded in 1941 by a group of mostly communist intellectuals. Its
    non-radical reformist platform and its name reflected the founders hopes
    to attract the larger religious population. However, the Party's
    Marxist-Leninist orientation and its anti-Imperialist and anti-Fascist
    positions made it most influential among intellectuals and educated
    Iranians. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, The Tudeh , with its
    country-wide organization, including active women, youth, and labor
    groups, as well as a secret military network ( Sazman-e Nezami-ye Hezb-e
    Tudeh Iran ), played a major role in Iran s political scene. The Tudeh was
    banned following an attempted assassination against the Shah in 1949.
    Nonetheless, the Party continued its activities as well as its
    publications, of which there would be many. Following the 19 August 1953
    coup, the Tudeh s military network was annihilated and many of its leaders
    arrested or forced into exile, mostly in the Soviet Union and Eastern
    Europe. Over the years, the Party s political influence diminished, due to
    the various splits resulting from its pro-Soviet stand and policies in
    periods of political tension in Iran, and from the radicalization of the
    left in the 1960s and 1970s. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported and collaborated with the new
    government. Though the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became
    the target of its attacks in 1982, and the Party's leaders and many
    members, including those of the new secret military network, were
    arrested. The Tudeh lost scores of its members during the mass prison
    killing of 1988. Following several splits, the Party resumed its
    activities in the early 1990s, in exile. Arrest and detention Mr. Qanbari
    was arrested by military police of the Division 81 Vintage Suit at the
    headquarters of the Logistics and Transportation Support Battalion in
    Division 81 Vintage Suit in Kermanshah on May 14, 1983 in the morning. He
    was detained at the Komiteh-Moshtarak location in Tohid, Tehran. After a
    month, he called his family. He had irregular brief contacts with his
    family mostly asking for money, clothes, or follow up on his case. After
    his trial, he was first transferred to Jamshidieh Prison, and later to the
    Evin Prison. He was detained for five years and several months with no
    visitations. (electronic form) Trial Mr. Qanbari was first tried by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of the Army, headed by a cleric, in Tehran. He
    was tried, along with eight other members of the Tudeh Party on January
    11, 1984 (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper). The trial for these individuals took
    several sessions on January 16 and 18, 1984. He was condemned to 20 years
    imprisonment (electronic form). Specific details about the circumstances
    of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Qanbari are unknown.
