    Mr. Bijan Farajpur is among 3208 members and sympathizers of the People's
    Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book
    documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. Additional
    information was drawn from the Bidaran. website. Mr. Farajpur is also one
    of 1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission's Special
    Representative's Report, "Names and particulars of persons allegedly
    executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the period July-December
    1988," published January 26, 1989. The report specifies that although 1000
    names are mentioned, "in all probability" there were several thousand
    victims. "Most of the alleged victims were members of the Mojahedin.
    However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe
    Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among
    the alleged victims." Further information on Mr. Farajpur’s execution was
    sent to Omid via an electronic form by a person familiar with this case.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Farajpur was arrested in Shiraz and taken to
    Adelabad Prison. He was detained for 2 years before his execution and had
    very limited contact with his family. Trial Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Farajpur and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with the presence of an
    attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This
    committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs
    and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the defendant.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners; accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the
    PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war
    against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    regarding the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense In their
    open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not
    given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion
    that prisoners were associated with guerillas operating near the borders,
    the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside
    during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions.
    Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a
    telephone every two weeks. We witnessed during the past seven years that
    they were denied access to anything that would have allowed them to
    establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such conditions
    the families reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were
    able to engage with any political group outside Iran. Judgment No sentence
    was issued publicly.
