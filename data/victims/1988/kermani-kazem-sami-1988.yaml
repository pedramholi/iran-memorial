    Information about Mr. Kazem Sami-Kermani, son of Gholamreza, is based on
    an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar
    with this case. According to this information, he was born in Mashhad in
    1935. He was married and a psychiatrist. He was also a member of the
    Revolutionary Movement of Iranian People, Health Minister in the
    provincial government; a candidate for the presidency during the first
    presidential election; and a representative of the Islamic Parliament.
    Additional information was taken from the Mihan website and a Payam-e
    Hajar publication. The Revolutionary Movement of Iranian People (JAMA) was
    established by several Muslim sympathizers of the National Movement,
    including Kazem Sami-Kermani and Habibollah Peyman. Their views favored
    nationalism, pro-soviet socialism, and Islam with a minor role for the
    latter. After the Islamic Revolution, influenced by the political
    atmosphere of the time, this group changed its name to the Revolutionary
    Movement of Iranian Moslem People. Habibollah Peyman separated from the
    group and founded the Fighting Moslems Movement. According to information
    sent to Omid , Mr. Kazem Sami-Kermani was assassinated by a person
    pretending to be a patient [stabbed Mr. Sami-Kermani] with blows of a
    knife in his office on November 23, 1988. He died two days later in a
    hospital. The murderer also locked Mr. Sami-Kermani s wife in a room.
    According to an interview with a close friend of Mr. Sami-Kermani by the
    Payam-e Hajar, published on November 23, 1999, authorities first announced
    the killing as a conspiracy to disturb the stability and security of the
    country. But when the body of the murderer, Mahmud Jalilian, was found in
    a public bath in Ahvaz, seemingly having hanged himself, authorities
    declared the motive for assassination to be a personal revenge. This was
    based on a bureaucratic dispute between the killer and Dr. Sami-Kermani in
    the UAE, many years before. However, according to this source, quoting
    officials and analyzing events of before and after the assassination,
    there were many reasons to reject the idea of personal revenge as a
    motive. According to the interviewee, when there is a personal motive and
    the murderer is gone, the case is closed, and there is a rush to close the
    case at the time. But, according to the private forensics report, the
    murderer was first killed and then hanged in the bath. Additionally, the
    family of Dr. Sami-Kermani was threatened not to pursue the case.
    Otherwise, there would be attempts on the lives of other members of the
    family. According to the Mihan website, Dr. Sami-Kermani, Head of the
    Revolutionary Movement of Iranian People and Health Minister of the
    Bazargan cabinet, had concluded that the gang who governed Iran consisted
    of a dangerous fascist group of people who drove the country to
    destruction. He expressed his opinions freely and criticized the regime,
    in spite of receiving several written and phone threats. After the
    assassination of Dr. Sami-Kermani, his family complained to the judiciary
    of the Islamic Republic. But the case, judged by Ali Yunesi, the
    Intelligence Minister at the time, was announced closed without any
    results. At the time, it was said that the crime had been carried out by a
    group of Hezbollah connected to the Intelligence Ministry and that the
    identity of murderer(s) were known to the judge. However, by order of the
    Intelligence Ministry, the judge closed the case.
