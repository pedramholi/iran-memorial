    Mr. Kiumars Mirhadi is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) whose execution was reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book
    documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. Additional
    information was drawn from the Bidaran website and the MKO website. He was
    born in Tehran in 1963. He was a member of the High School Student Militia
    of MKO. Arrest and detention The details of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. According to the MKO website, Mr. Kiumars Mirhadi
    was arrested and taken to Gohardasht Prison in 1981. He was kept in
    solitary confinement. Trial Mr. Kiumars Mirhadi was tried and condemned to
    ten years imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the
    trials that led to his execution and that of thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney and
    prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has ever been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass
    executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the victims’ families
    refer to the accusations against the prisoners that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being “counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to MKO members as “hypocrites” who do not
    believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also “waging
    war against God” and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available about his defense. In their
    open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not
    given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion
    that prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating near the
    borders, the families point to the isolation of their relatives during
    their detention: “Our children lived in most difficult conditions. All
    visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a
    telephone every two weeks. For over seven years we witnessed that they
    were denied access to anything that would have allowed them to establish
    contacts outside their prison walls.” Under such conditions the families
    reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were able to
    engage with the political groups outside Iran. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the execution sentence. Mr. Kiumars Mirhadi
    was hanged during the mass killings of the political prisoners at
    Gohardasht Prison in August 1988.
