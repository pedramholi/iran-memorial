    Mr. Farajollah Mizani is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission’s Special Representative’s Report, “Names and
    Particulars of Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    from July through December 1988,” published January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, “in all probability”
    there were several thousand victims. “Most of the alleged victims were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organizatioin (MKO). However, members of
    the Tudeh Party, People’s Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization as well as 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims.” The information about Mr. Farajollah Mizani (Javanshir) is taken
    from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by The Tudeh Party
    Publications and the book Memories by Mohammad Rayshahri (the Chief Judge
    of the time) published by the Center for Islamic Revolution Documents. Mr.
    Mizani was born in Tabriz in 1926. He had degree in engineering from
    Tehran University, as well as a degree in History. According to the above
    book, he joined the Tudeh Party in 1945. In 1957, he moved out of the
    country and did not return until the 1979 Revolution. First, he was an
    advisor to the Central Committee and then, he became a member of the
    Political Committee. He wrote several books of both fiction and
    nonfiction, and he translated several Russian novels into Farsi. The Tudeh
    Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Party’s ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The
    Party played a major role in Iran’s political scene until it was banned
    for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Tudeh declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the
    new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    According to the Tudeh book, Mr. Farajollah Mizani was arrested by the
    Revolutionary Guards on April 27, 1983. Trial Mr. Farajollah Mizani was
    tried and condemned to life imprisonment. Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Mizani and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with the presence of an
    attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This
    committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs
    and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges Among the charges against Mr. Farajollah Mizani, mentioned
    in the book Memoirs , was his “connection with agents in the Embassy of
    the Soviet Union.” No charge was ever publicly leveled against the victims
    of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities’ accusations that may
    have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict from the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    reproduced in the memoirs of his designated successor Ayatollah Montazeri,
    corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against the
    executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the MKO
    members as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and who “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization
    named by the leader of the Islamic Republic, may have been accused of
    being “anti-religion” for not having renounced his or her beliefs.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant other than the testimony of two witnesses
    (Partovi, in charge of the underground organization, and Kianuri, the
    party leader), ment
