    Mr. Iraj (also spelled "Iradj") Afshin is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is
    listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i International Community.
    The report documents the persecution of the members of the Faith in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978. The Baha
    is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the
    Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious
    community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300
    thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention No information is
    available on the circumstances of this defendant's arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Afshin's trial, including whether
    or not he had legal counsel. Charges The charges against Mr. Afshin are
    not known. Because of the unanimous international condemnation of the
    persecution of this quietist (apolitical) religious community, Iranian
    authorities do not always admit that the Baha'is are being punished for
    their religious beliefs. Therefore, judicial authorities have often
    wrongfully charged Baha'is with offenses such as "being involved in
    counter-revolutionary activities," "having supported the former regime,"
    "being agents of Zionism," or "being involved with prostitution, adultery,
    and immorality." Evidence of guilt No information is available on the
    evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Afshin's defense. The representatives of the Baha'i
    community stress that their members are being persecuted for their
    religious beliefs. They refute the validity of charges such as
    counter-revolutionary political activities or spying leveled against them
    in Iranian courts. They point out that the fundamental principles of their
    religion require them to show loyalty and obedience to their government
    and refrain from any political involvement. Judgment This defendant was
    sentenced to death and executed. Baha'is have reported to human rights
    organizations that the text of sentences is often not communicated to
    them. ----------------------------------- 1- Slow Death for Iran s Baha is
    by Richard N. Ostling, Time Magazine,20 February 1984. Also see The
    Persecution of the Baha is of Iran, 1844-1984, by Douglas Martin, Baha i
    Studies,volume 12/13, 1984, p. 3. There is no information about the
    current number of Baha is in Iran. 2- The Islamic Republic Penal Code
    grants no rights to Baha'is, and the courts have denied them the right to
    redress or to protection against assault, murder, and other forms of
    persecution and abuse. In so doing, the courts have treated Baha'is as
    unprotected citizens or "apostates," citing eminent religious authorities
    whose edicts are considered to be a source of law equal to acts of
    Parliament. The Founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, made
    execution a punishment for the crime of apostasy and decreed that a Muslim
    would not be punished for killing an apostate.
