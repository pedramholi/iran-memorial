    Mr. Davud Qoreishi is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission’s Special Representative’s Report, “Names and Particulars of
    Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran from July
    through December 1988,” published January 26, 1989. The report specifies
    that although 1,000 names are mentioned, “in all probability” there were
    several thousand victims. “Most of the alleged victims were members of the
    Mojahedin (MKO). However, members of the Tudeh Party, People’s Fedaiyan
    Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization as well as 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims.” Additional information
    about Mr. Davud Qoreishi is taken from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh
    Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party Publications and the book Memoirs by
    Mohammad Rayshahri (the Chief Judge of the time) published by the Center
    for Islamic Revolution Documents. He was born in Tehran in 1952. He
    graduated from the Military College. In 1978, he joined the Tudeh Party as
    an Air Force officer and a specialist on fueling 747 Jumbo jets. Then, he
    became active in the secret Military Branch of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh
    Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The
    Party played a major role in Iran’s political scene until it was banned
    for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the
    new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The details of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Davud Qoreishi
    was arrested in May of 1983. His detention place was Jamshidieh garrison.
    The above book quotes eye-witness saying: “He was in solitary confinement
    for five months. They kept him standing for 48 hours at a time. As a
    result, his legs and feet swelled.” Trial Mr. Davud Qoreishi was tried in
    a single session trial along with nine others. He was condemned to ten
    years imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials
    that led to the execution of Mr. Qoreishi and thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney and
    prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges According
    to the book Memoirs , in his first trial, the charges brought against Mr.
    Qoreishi were as follows: “He was an active member of the secret Military
    Branch [of the Tudeh Party] and devlivered reports about three individuals
    to the Party. Additionally, he was accused of having arranged street
    meetings, organizing Party meetings in his personal residence in the
    presence of his wife, and providing a fund of 10,000 Tumans and a monthly
    contribution of 400 Tumans to the Party”. No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
