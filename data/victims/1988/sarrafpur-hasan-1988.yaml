    Mr. Hasan Sarrafpur is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and Particulars of
    Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran During
    July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report specifies that
    although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all probability" there were
    several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were members of the
    Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fadayian
    Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization as well as 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims." Information about Mr.
    Sarrafpur is taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001 by The
    Tudeh Party of Iran Publications. He was born in Dezful, was an Air Force
    officer and a member of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was
    created in 1941. The Tudeh's ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it
    supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major
    role in Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second time
    following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh
    declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. No
    information is available about the date that Mr. Sarrafpur was arrested.
    According to the book, he was first detained in the Evin Prison and later
    transferred to the Gohardasht Prison. Trial There is no information about
    the trial. Also, there is no specific information about the circumstances
    of such trials that condemned this defendant and thousands of other
    political prisoners to death in a few months period. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was publicly levelled against the
    defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners –
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were
    not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating
    near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives
    from the outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most
    difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass
    divider through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed, over the past
    seven years, that they were denied access to anything that would have
    allowed them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under
    such conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that
    these prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside
    Iran. It is possible that the prisoners who were members of organizations
    other than the Mojahedin Khalq were charge for being "anti religious" and
    were condemned for insisting on their beliefs. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the defendant’s execution. According to the
    book, Mr. Sarrafpur was hanged during the mass killings of political
    prisoners in Gohardasht Prison in September 1988.
