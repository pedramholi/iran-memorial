    Information about Mr. Mohsen Karimnejad has been drawn from an electronic
    form sent to Omid. Mr. Karimnejad’s name is also mentioned in the book
    Crime Against Humanity (a publication of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization). He was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners
    in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and
    witnesses’ memoirs. Mr. Karimnejad was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. He was senior student at the Mer’at High School in
    Tehran. Arrest and detention There is no detailed information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention other than he was arrested one afternoon
    in October/November 1981 on Resalat street in Tehran and taken to Evin
    prison. Trial At his first trial, Mr. Karimnejad was condemned to 10 years
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Karimnejad and thousands of other individuals in
    1988 are not known. According to existing information, there was no
    official trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who
    were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No information is available on the
    charges at the first trial. No charge has been publicly leveled against
    the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being “counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who do not
    believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also “waging
    war against God” and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt
    According to the form, the evidence against him at the first trial
    consisted of a leaflet and possession of a screw-driver; it was argued the
    tool could be used as a weapon. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Karimnejad’s defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves
    in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners
    (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed members of the
    Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic
    Republic, states that such claims “are false considering the circumstances
    in prisons; for our children faced most difficult conditions [in prison,
    with] visitation rights of once every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten
    minutes through a telephone from behind the glass window, and were
    deprived of any connection with the outside world. We faced such
    conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of our claim.” Judgment
    The details regarding the execution sentence are not available. Mr. Mohsen
    Karimnejad was hanged on July 30, 1988 in Gohardasht prison. Months after
    the executions, prison authorities informed the families about the
    executions and handed in the victims’ belongings to their families. The
    bodies, however, were not returned to them. The bodies were buried in mass
    graves. Authorities warned the families of prisoners against holding
