    Ms. Maryam Golzadeh Ghafuri is among 3208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) whose execution was reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book
    documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. Additional
    information was drawn from the weblog of Mina Entezari, the book Prison
    Memoirs by Fariba Sabet; (both authors were Ms. Golzadeh Ghafuri’s former
    cellmates), as well as Mr. Iraj Mesdaghi’s website. Information about the
    mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the
    memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations,
    interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Ms. Golzadeh
    Ghafuri was born on October 30, 1960. Ms. Mina Entezari remembers Ms.
    Golzadeh Ghafuri as a quiet, dignified young woman with a lovely smile.
    Ms. Golzadeh Ghafuri was a mathematics student at Tehran University. Her
    father was a cleric, with a doctorate degree in law from Sorbonne
    University in Paris. He was elected a representative to the Majles
    (Parliament) but due to his disapproval of government’s policies, he gave
    up his political career (Ms. Entezari’s weblog). Two of her brothers were
    executed in 1981: Mohammad Sadeq, and Mohammad Kazem. Her husband, Mr. Ali
    Reza Haj Samadi was also executed during the massacre of political
    prisoners in 1988. Arrest and detention According to Ms. Entezari, Ms.
    Golzadeh Ghafuri was arrested along with her husband in 1982 due to
    connections with the MKO. In 1873, probably after she was condemned to
    imprisonment, she was transferred to Section 8 of Qezelhesar prison.
    There, in order to differentiate her from other cellmates with the same
    name, she was called Maryam Gol (“tuberose flower”). The conditions of
    prisoners in this section were very difficult and the section was used as
    a place to “chastise” prisoners. However, when in the fall of 1984, the
    conditions somewhat improved and prisoners were allowed to read and had
    access to some books such as school textbooks, Mr. Golzadeh Ghafuri taught
    mathematics, geometry, algebra, and trigonometry (Ms. Entezari’s weblog).
    Ms. Golzadeh Ghafuri suffered from arthritis, which, according to her
    cellmate, was the result of difficult conditions of interrogation and
    imprisonment. She used a cervical collar and a piece of lumber that she
    tied to her back. Ms. Entezari writes: “When I walked in the yard of
    Section 4 [of the prison], I could see her sitting with difficulty and
    teaching her students with much patience and seriousness, I’d say: ‘How
    many geometry and algebra formulas do you have to prove with your broken
    neck?’ and she’d reply: ‘go, don’t interrupt the lesson!’” ( ibid ). Since
    Ms. Golzadeh Ghafuri’s father, as a sign of protest to present conditions,
    would not go to visit his son and daughter in prison, Ms. Golzadeh Ghafuri
    and her older brother were given a temporary leave for 2 hours in order to
    visit their father at home (Ms. Entezari’s weblog). In the winter of 1986,
    the circumstances in prison worsened and Ms. Golzadeh Ghafuri was
    transferred to Evin. There she, along with some other cellmates, refrained
    from any visitations to protest their poor living conditions. In the
    summer, prisoners were allowed to do aerobic exercises and play
    volleyball, but Ms. Golzadeh Ghafuri couldn’t participate in sport due to
    her backache and neck pain, she only would do some sitting exercises just
    to be part of it ( ibid ). In the fall, she was sent to Hall 3 of Evin
    where, she and some other cellmate started a hunger strike, as a means to
    object to their difficult conditions in prison; the hunger strike lasted
    for almost 2 weeks ( ibid ). Trial Ms. Golzadeh Ghafuri was first tried,
    probably in 1982 or 83, and condemned to 12 years imprisonment. Specific
    details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of
    Ms. Golzadeh Ghafuri and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not
    known. According to existing information, there was no official trial with
    the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in
    1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the fami
