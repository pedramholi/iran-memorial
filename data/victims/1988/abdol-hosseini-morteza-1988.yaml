    Mr. Morteza Abdol-Hosseini is one of the victims of the 1988-89 mass
    execution of political prisoners whose name is published in a November 2,
    1989 United Nations’ Report of the Economic and Social Council on the
    “Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran,” prepared by
    Mr. Reynaldo Galindo Pohl (El Salvador), Special Representative of the
    Commission on Human Rights. Executed prisoners were mostly members or
    sympathizers of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, or other
    Marxist Leninist organizations such as, the People’s Fedayin of Iran, the
    Tudeh Party, and the Peykar Organization. Arrest and detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial The
    circumstances that led to this defendant's execution are unknown. However,
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is the
    proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving at the time they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against Mr. Abdol-Hosseini. In their letters to the Minister of
    Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February
    2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities' accusations
    against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution.
    These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims
    regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict,
    Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not
    believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also "waging
    war against God" and should be sentenced to death. The defendant, who did
    not belong to the organization named by the leader of the Islamic
    Republic, may have been accused of being "anti-religion" for not having
    renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Abdol-Hosseini. Defense In their open letter, the families of
    the prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. Judgment No sentence was issued publicly.
