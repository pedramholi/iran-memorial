    Information about Mr. Shahriar Esfarayeni was gathered from an electronic
    form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a relative, the website of
    Iranian Leftist Students and Youths Council, and the Mojahedin Khalq
    website. He was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in
    1988. The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information
    regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri,
    reports from human rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and
    victims families, as well as the Bidaran website. The majority of the
    executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other
    victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Mr. Shahriar
    Esfarayeni s name is among the victims of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, on its website. However, according to the website of the
    Iranian Leftist Students and Youths Council, Mr. Esfarayeni was one of
    several sympathizers of the Mojahedin who had changed his ideology to
    communism at the prison. The person sending the electronic form, however,
    is certain that Mr. Esfarayeni was not affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq
    or any other organization. Arrest and detention There is no specific
    information on Mr. Shahriar Esfarayeni s arrest and detention. Trial There
    are no specific details about the circumstances of the trials that led to
    the execution of Mr. Shahriar Esfarayeni. According to the testimonies of
    leftist political prisoners who were tried in Iran s Prisons during the
    executions of the summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room in the
    prisons after a few weeks of isolation during which prisoners were
    deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoors
    time. Toward the end of August, a three-member delegation composed of the
    prosecutor, a religious judge, and a representative of the Ministry of
    Information asked prisoners questions about whether they were Muslim or
    Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were practicing
    Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the later were sentenced to be
    hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The authorities never
    informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious
    implications of their responses. During the summer of 1988, according to
    survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or
    Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to the Minister of Justice at the time,
    Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly stated
    against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. Based on the testimonies
    of those who were in prison during the summer of 1988, the questions of
    the three-member committee of the leftist prisoners were about their
    beliefs and they were accused of being anti-religion, insisting on their
    beliefs and not repenting. In their letters to the Minister of Justice in
    1988, and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against the
    prisoners accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam, as well as having been associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An edict of the Leader
    of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as hypocrites who do not believe in Islam and who wage war
    against God and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also waging war against God and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Shahriar Esfarayeni. Defense No information is available about Mr.
    Shahriar Esfarayeni s defense before the three-member committee. Judgment
    Mr. Shahriar Esfarayeni was executed during the mass killings of political
    prisoners at Vakilabad Prison in Mashhad in 1988. Based on the Boroumand
    Foundation s research, leftist prisoners executed in 1988 had been found
    to be apostates
