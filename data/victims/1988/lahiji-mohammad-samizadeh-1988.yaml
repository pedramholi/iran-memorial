    Information about Mr. Mohammad Sami zadeh Lahiji was gathered from an
    electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with
    this case and from the website of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Mr.
    Mohammad Sami zadeh Lahiji is also listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were
    reported by the organization in a book titled Crime Against Humanity . He
    is also one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission
    Special Representative s Report, published on January 26, 1989. The
    Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information regarding the
    1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families,
    as well as from the Bidaran website. * According to the electronic form,
    Mr. Sami zadeh Lahiji, son of Rasul, was born in Lahijan. He was married,
    with a twin. In the beginning of the Revolution, he and his brother,
    Abdollah, who was killed in 1983, were members of the Revolutionary Guards
    in Lahijan. Abdollah was the chief, and Mohammad was his deputy. But, they
    quit and started working in the Jahad-e Sazandegi (Jihad of Construction).
    A couple of months later, they published an announcement to declare their
    separation from the regime and joining the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam to be their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the
    1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    reorganize the MKO and to recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, whether by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic s
    leaders. ** Arrest and Detention According to the MKO website, Mr. Sami
    zadeh Lahiji s activities during the candidacy of Masud Rajavi for
    president caused him to be identified and arrested in early 1981. He was
    detained for eight years, spent some time in the Chuka Prison in Bandar-e
    Anzali, and was later transferred to Lahijan. No specific information is
    available concerning his arrest and detention. Trial According to the MKO
    website, Mr. Sami zadeh Lahiji was first tried and condemned to six months
    imprisonment. After the demonstrations of June 20, 1981, however, he was
    tried again and condemned to fifteen years imprisonment. No information is
    available on the trial that condemned him to death. According to the
    testimonies of some of the political prisoners who were tried during the
    executions of the summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room in the
    prison, after a few weeks of isolation during which prisoners were
    deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time.
    In August and September, a three-member delegation composed of the public
    prosecutor, a religious judge, and a representative of the Ministry of
    Information asked prisoners questions about their views on the Mojahedin,
    whether they would renounce their beliefs, and if they were ready to
    cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the
    prisoners would have been charged with counter revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam as well as being associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders and
    would be sentenced to death. The authorities never informed prisoners
    about the delegation s purpose and the serious implications of their
    responses. During the summer of 1988, according to survivors, a large
    number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or leftist groups were
    executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout
