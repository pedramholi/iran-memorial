    Mr. Hesamodin Sahabi is among 3208 members and sympathizers of the
    People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity.
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran website. Arrest and
    detention No specific information is available on Mr. Sahabi's arrest and
    detention. Trial The circumstances that led to this defendant's execution
    are unknown. However, relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988
    refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of
    executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of
    Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is the proof of their illegality. They note that an
    overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to
    prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No
    charge has been publicly leveled against the defendant. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities' accusations against the prisoners; accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the
    PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war
    against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    regarding the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense In their
    open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not
    given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion
    that prisoners were associated with guerillas operating near the borders,
    the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside
    during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions.
    Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a
    telephone every two weeks. We witnessed during the past seven years that
    they were denied access to anything that would have allowed them to
    establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such conditions
    the families reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were
    able to engage with any political group outside Iran. Judgment No sentence
    was issued publicly.
