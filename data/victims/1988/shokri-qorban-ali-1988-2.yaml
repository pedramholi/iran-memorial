    Mr. Qorban Ali Shokri was a victim of the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and
    witnesses’ memoirs. The information regarding Mr. Shokri has been gathered
    from an interview with his wife. Born in Arasbaran (East Azarbaijan
    province), he was married and had one child. He was a student and a
    teacher and a member of the Ettehadieh Komonist-ha. His wife and son, who
    were arrested at the same time as he, were imprisoned for more than four
    years. The Ettehadieh Komonist-ha was created by exiled opponents of the
    Pahlavi regime who mostly belonged to the Student Confederation. They
    followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung but did not believe in guerilla
    warfare. The group became marked by ideological divides during the periods
    preceding and following the 1979 revolution which caused it to split into
    several factions. One of the most important rifts was triggered by the
    decision by a number of members to take up arms and take over a city in
    Iran. The uprising plan, devised in the midst of an active and violent
    anti-communist campaign by the revolutionary Islamic government, split the
    Ettehadieh in two factions: one believed in the armed movement and the
    other opposed it. Arrest and detention Mr. Shokri was arrested by the
    Revolutionary Guards outside his residence in August of 1985. He was
    transferred to Evin prison. According to his wife, “The Revolutionary
    Guards came to our house and told us that he was arrested for drug related
    charges. I was home with my newborn baby and my cousin. They took us to
    Evin prison as well.” According to the interviewee, they were arrested
    with verbal abuse, and threatened not to say anything to their neighbors.
    Mr. Shokri’s wife had had no news of him for five months, at which time
    they were both tried the same day, and were allowed a visit after the
    trial. They had some visits, conducted from behind a glass divider, and
    then regular visits in the presence of a guard, sitting between them,
    every two weeks. During their last visit, a week before Mr. Shokri’s
    execution, he told his wife that “we must get out somehow and this place
    is not suitable to stay.” Mr. Shokri was imprisoned for three years.
    According to his wife, one day when she was sitting with her child waiting
    in the hallway to be interrogated, she saw her husband from the corner of
    her blindfold being helped by a man and the interrogator told the man,
    “see if his rib is broken, take him to the doctor.” It was evident to her
    that Mr. Shokri had been severely tortured. Trial Mr. Shokri, after a few
    minutes trial that took place in the winter of 1986 in Evin prison, was
    condemned to five years imprisonment. Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Shokri and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of
    the 1988 mass execution in a court with the presence of a defense lawyer.
    The prisoners executed in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member
    special committee composed of a religious judge, a representative of the
    Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned
    the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and their faith in God and
    religion. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization
    named by the leader of the Islamic Republic, may have been accused of
    being “anti-religion” for not having renounced his or her beliefs. Charges
    No charge has been leveled publicly against the defendant. In their
    letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities’ accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [oppos
