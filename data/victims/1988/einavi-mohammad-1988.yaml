    The information about Mr. Mohammad Einavi has been drawn from an
    electronic form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. He
    is also one of the 3208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO, also PMIO) whose execution was reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . Mr. Einavi was a
    victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority
    of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs.
    Mr. Einavi was born in Khoramshahr (Lorestan province) and was a third
    year high school student, majoring in electronics. Arrest and detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention,
    other than Mr. Einavi was arrested one morning in Yasuj (Kohkiluyeh and
    Boyerahmad province). He was detained/imprisoned in Yasuj and Shiraz
    (electronic form). According to the available information, at the time of
    arrest, Mr. Einavi was 17 or younger. Trial Mr. Einavi was tried in 1981
    in Yasuj and the religious judge condemned him to two years imprisonment.
    He was later tried in Shiraz and resentenced to 8 years imprisonment.
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Einavi and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not
    known. According to existing information, there was no official trial with
    the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in
    1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about
    their beliefs and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges At his first trial, Mr. Einavi was charged with
    “distribution of the Mojahed newspaper throughout Yasuj city” (electronic
    form). No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988
    mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and
    to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families
    of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners
    – accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as
    well as being “associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt According to the electronic form, at
    the first trial, the judge used the Mojahed newspaper as an evidence of
    guilt. No further information is available on other evidence of guilt in
    other trials. Defense No information is available on Mr. Einavi’s defense.
    In their open letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants
    were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same
    letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the
    prison) had collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization
    in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such
    claims “are false considering the circumstances in prisons; for our
    children faced most difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation
    rights of once every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through
    a telephone from behind the glass window, and were deprived of any
    connection with the outside world. We faced such conditions for seven
    years, which proves the truth of our claim.” Judgment The de
