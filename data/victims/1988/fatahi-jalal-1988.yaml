    Information about Mr. Jalal Fattahi, son of Mojtaba, was gathered from
    several electronic forms sent to the Boroumand Foundation by persons
    familiar with his case. Mr. Jalal Fattahi is also cited in the list by the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, Minority Branch, as an affiliate of the
    organization, who was executed in Iran after the 1979 revolution
    (published on 26 September 2009). He was a victim of the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The Boroumand Foundation has collected
    additional information regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human rights organizations, interviews
    with the witnesses and victims families, as well as from the Bidaran
    website. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization - which opposed the Islamic
    Republic - as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Mr. Jalal Fattahi was born in Malayer on September 22,
    1950. He was single and had four sisters. He was a mechanical engineering
    student at the Science and Technology University and a sympathizer of the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Minority). During the previous regime, he had
    been a political prisoner condemned to life in prison. He served five
    years before being released during the revolution. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization - a Marxist-Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America - was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. In 1981, the
    Organization, which had opted for open political and electoral activity
    after the revolution, split over the critique of the concept of urban
    guerilla warfare and the support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet
    Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and,
    though it did not abandon the theory of armed struggle, its activities
    were mainly limited to the political arena and the labor movement.
    Following the Mojahedin Khalq Organization s June 21st declaration of
    armed struggle, the Fadaiyan announced the organization of combatant
    cells. However, based on available information, these cells did not become
    operational. Many of the groups members and supporters were arrested and
    executed in the early 1980 s. Arrest and detention Mr. Jalal Fattahi was
    arrested at Keshavarz Boulevard in Tehran on February 18, 1982, at 8:00
    p.m. There is no specific information on his arrest and detention. Trial
    During his first trial, Mr. Jalal Fattahi was condemned to death, but the
    appeal court changed his sentence to eight years imprisonment. Specific
    details about the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of
    Mr. Jalal Fattahi are unknown. According to the testimonies of leftist
    political prisoners who were tried in Gohardasht Prison during the
    executions of the summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room on the
    ground floor of the prison after a few weeks of isolation during which
    prisoners were deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts,
    and outdoor time. Toward the end of August, a three-member delegation
    composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor, Hojatoleslam Nayyeri,
    the religious judge, and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of
    the Ministry of Information, asked prisoners questions about whether they
    were Muslim or Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were
    practicing Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the latter were
    sentenced to be hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The
    authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and
    the serious implications of their responses. According to survivors,
    during the summer of 1988 a large number of prisoners sympathizing with
    the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their
    beliefs. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to the Minister of Justice at
    the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding
    these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an
    overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to
    prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed when
    they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly stated against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. Based on
    the testimonies of the prisoners who were in prisons in the summer of
    1988, the questions of the three-member committee from the leftist
    prisoners were about their beliefs, and they were accused of being
    anti-religion, insisting on their beliefs and not repenting. In their
    letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988 and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran in Febr
