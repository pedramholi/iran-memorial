    Mr. Teimur Ravandi is one of 1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission s Special Representative s Report, Names and particulars of
    persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the
    period July-December 1988, published January 26, 1989. Additional
    information has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir
    of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews
    with victims families, witnesses memoirs, as well as electronic form sent
    to Omid by a relative. The UN specifies that although 1000 names are
    mentioned, in all probability there were several thousand victims. Most of
    the alleged victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the
    Tudeh Party, People s Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims. Mr. Teimur Ravandi s name, an affiliate of the Tudeh Party, is
    also taken from the book Those Who Said No , published in 1999 in Paris by
    the Association for the Defense of Political Prisoners and Prisoners of
    Conscience in Iran. He was a victim of the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    by human rights organizations, interviews with victims families, and
    witnesses memoirs. The Tudeh Party of Iran ( Hezbe Tudeh or the Party of
    the Masses) was founded in 1941 by a group of mostly communist
    intellectuals. Its non-radical reformist platform and its name reflected
    the founders hopes to attract the larger religious population. However,
    the Party's Marxist-Leninist orientation and its anti-Imperialist and
    anti-Fascist positions made it most influential among intellectuals and
    educated Iranians. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, The Tudeh , with its
    country-wide organization, including active women, youth, and labor
    groups, as well as a secret military network ( Sazman-e Nezami-ye Hezb-e
    Tudeh Iran ), played a major role in Iran s political scene. The Tudeh was
    banned following an attempted assassination against the Shah in 1949.
    Nonetheless, the Party continued its activities as well as its
    publications, of which there would be many. Following the 19 August 1953
    coup, the Tudeh s military network was annihilated and many of its leaders
    arrested or forced into exile, mostly in the Soviet Union and Eastern
    Europe. Over the years, the Party s political influence diminished, due to
    the various splits resulting from its pro-Soviet stand and policies in
    periods of political tension in Iran and from the radicalization of the
    left in the 1960s and 1970s. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported and collaborated with the
    government. Though the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became
    the target of its attacks in 1982, and the Party's leaders and many
    members, including those of the new secret military network, were
    arrested. The Tudeh lost scores of its members during the mass prison
    killing of 1988. Following several splits, the Party resumed its
    activities in the early 1990s in exile. Arrest and detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial
    Specific details about the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Ravandi and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are
    not known. According to existing information, there was no official trial
    with attorneys or prosecutors. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent
    to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative
    from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This
    committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs
    and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue
    that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed when they were retried and sentenced to death.
    Charges No charge has been publicly stated against the victims of the 1988
    mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988, and
    to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the fam
