    Mr. Ebrahim Hassanpur Shirazi is one of the victims in the mass killings
    of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners
    were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In addition to
    members of those Marxist-Leninist organizations oppose to the Islamic
    Republic, activists of organizations such as the Tudeh Party and the
    Fadayian Khalq (Majority) that were not against the Islamic Republic, were
    also among the victims of this mass killings. The information about Mr.
    Hasanpur Shirazi is taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001
    by The Tudeh Party of Iran publications. He was born in Dorud and
    graduated from the Science and Technology University of Tehran majoring in
    engineering. In 1971, one year after entering the university, he joined
    the Tudeh Party and continued to publish and distribute the Party
    publications until 1978. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The
    Tudeh's ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the
    former Soviet Union. The Tudeh Party played a major role in Iran's
    political scene until it was banned for the second time following the
    August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh Party declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and his Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of its
    attacks from 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members were
    imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Hasanpur Shirazi was arrested in
    May 1983. Trial Mr. Hasanpur Shirazi was tried and condemned to life
    imprisonment. There is no information about the trial. Also, there is no
    specific information about the circumstances of such trials that condemned
    this defendant and thousands of other political prisoners to death in a
    few months period. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988
    refuted the legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of
    executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of
    Justice Dr. Habibi, they argued that the official secrecy surrounding
    these executions is proof of their illegality. They noted that an
    overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to
    prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No
    charge was publicly levelled against the defendant. In their letters to
    the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting
    Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities' accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the
    PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war
    against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrilla troops operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed, over the past seven
    years, that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed
    them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such
    conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that these
    prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside Iran. It
    is possible that the prisoners who were members of organizations other
    than the Mojahedin Khalq were charge for being "anti religious" and were
    condemned for insisting on their beliefs. Judgment No specific information
    is available about the defendant’s execution sentence. Mr. Hasanpur
    Shirazi was hanged during the mass killings of political prisoners in
    September 1988.
