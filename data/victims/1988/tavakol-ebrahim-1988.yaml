    The information about Mr. Ebrahim Tavakol has been drawn from an
    electronic form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. He
    was born in Khoramshahr and affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Mr. Tavakol was a victim of the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    of human rights organizations, interviews with victims families, and
    witnesses memoirs. Arrest and detention There is no specific information
    on the defendant s arrest and detention, other than Mr. Tavakol was
    arrested in 1981. Trial Specific details on the circumstances of the
    trials that led to the execution of Mr. Tavakol and thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney and
    prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being
    associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as hypocrites who do
    not believe in Islam and wage war against God and decrees that prisoners
    who still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also
    waging war against God and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Tavakol s defense. In their open letter, the families of
    the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that
    these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed
    members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed forces of the
    Islamic Republic, states that such claims are false considering the
    circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most difficult conditions
    [in prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15 days, each visitation
    lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind the glass window, and
    were deprived of any connection with the outside world. We faced such
    conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of our claim. Judgment
    The details regarding the execution sentence are not available. Mr.
    Ebrahim Tavakol was executed in 1988. Months after the executions, prison
    authorities informed the families about the executions and handed in the
    victims belongings to their families. The bodies, however, were not
    returned to them. The bodies were buried in mass graves. Authorities
    warned the families of prisoners against holding memorial ceremonies.
