    Mr. Ali Reza Zomorrodian is one victim of the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Many of the executed
    prisoners were members or sympathizers of the People’s Mojahedin
    Organization of Iran (PMOI, also known as MKO). However, members or
    supporters of Marxist Leninist organizations, such as the People’s
    Fadaiyan of Iran (Minority) or Peykar, which opposed the Islamic Republic,
    as well as the Tudeh Party and Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not
    oppose the regime, were among the victims. Complementary information has
    been gathered from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human
    rights organizations, interviews with family members, and memoirs of
    witnesses, all provided to the Boroumand Foundation. News of the execution
    of Mr. Ali Reza Zomorrodian was published by Andishe-va-Peykar in 1995 in
    the book “An Unequal Battle: a report of seven years in prison, from 1982
    to 1989” by Nima Parvaresh. According to this report, Mr. Ali Reza
    Zomorrodian was a senior member of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who
    spent 7 years in the Shah’s prison and another 7 years in the prison of
    the Islamic Republic. He was the brother of Leila Zomorrodian, a
    well-known militant of the1970s. He was a sympathizer of the Peykar
    Organization and an editorial board member of the Peykar-e-Theoric
    publication. Mr. Ali Reza Zomorrodian is one of the 430 individuals whose
    names appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va
    Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the organization
    who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on
    this list have been executed. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation
    of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention There
    is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Ali Reza Zomorrodian and thousands of other individuals
    in 1988 are not known. According to available information, the Iranian
    authorities did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court
    with the presence of defense lawyers. The prisoners executed in 1988 had
    been questioned by a three-member special committee composed of a
    religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the
    Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about
    their beliefs, and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed when they were retried and sentenced to death.
    Charges No charge has been leveled publicly against the defendant. In
    their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against
    God," and should be sentenced to death. Defendants who did not belong to
    the organization named by the leader of the Islamic Republic may have b
