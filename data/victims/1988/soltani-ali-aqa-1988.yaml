    Information about Mr. Ali Aqa Soltani, son of Ghazanfar, was gathered from
    an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a relative and the
    list of victims published by the Committee for Human Rights in
    Iran-Sweden. Mr. Aliaqa Soltani is also listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were
    reported by the organization in a book titled Crime Against Humanity . He
    is also one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission
    Special Representative s Report published on January 26, 1989. The
    Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information regarding the
    1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families,
    as well as the Bidaran website. * Mr. Ali Aqa Soltani was born in Sonqor
    Kolia i in Kermanshah province in 1956. He graduated from the Teacher s
    College and worked as a teacher in that city. However, he was purged for
    being a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. (Content of the
    Electronic form) The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary,
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a split within the
    Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the
    imprisoned leaders of the MKO were released, along with other political
    prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to recruit new members
    based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment
    of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah
    Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in the
    political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. ** Arrest and Detention Mr. Ali Aqa
    Soltani was arrested, along with his fianc e, at a house belonging to the
    Mojahedin in Tehran in 1983. No specific information is available on his
    arrest and detention. Trial During his first trial, Mr. Ali Aqa Soltani
    had been condemned to seven years imprisonment. No information is
    available on his second trial. According to the testimonies of some of the
    political prisoners who were tried during the executions of the summer of
    1988 in Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the trials took place in a room on
    the ground floor of the prison, after a few weeks of isolation, during
    which prisoners were deprived of visitation, television and radio
    broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and September, a three-member
    delegation composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam
    Nayyeri, the religious judge; and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi,
    representative of the Ministry of Information asked prisoners questions
    about their views regarding the Mojahedin, whether they would renounce
    their beliefs, and if they were ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin.
    Based on what the answers were, the prisoners would have been charged with
    counter revolutionary, anti-religion and anti-Islam or associated with
    military action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders
    and would be sentenced to death. The authorities never informed prisoners
    about the delegation s purpose and the serious implications of their
    responses. During the summer of 1988, according to survivors, a large
    number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were
    executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then-Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges The charge against
    Mr. Ali Aqa Soltani was sympathizing with the Mojahedin Khalq during his
    first trial. No charge has been publicly leveled
