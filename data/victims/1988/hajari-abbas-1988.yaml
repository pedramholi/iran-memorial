    Mr. Abbas Hajari is one of the victims of the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Others targetted were members of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations opposed to the Islamic Republic such as the
    Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization. Still other victims
    were members of organizations such as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan
    Khalq (Majority) that were not against the Islamic Republic. The
    information about Mr. Hajari is taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs ,
    copyright 2001 by The Tudeh Party of Iran publications. He was born in
    Mashhad and in 1944, he graduated from the Military College. In 1945, he
    joined the Tudeh Party. After serving the party in various locations for
    years, he was arrested and condemned to life imprisonment in 1953. After
    25 years in prison, at the beginning of the Revolution, he was released
    from prison and continued his activities with the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh
    Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh ideology was Marxist-Leninist
    and it supported the policies of the former Soviet Union. The Tudeh Party
    played a major role in Iran's political scene until it was banned for the
    second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution,
    the Tudeh Party actively supported the new government. Although the Tudeh
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members
    were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown. Mr. Hajari was arrested in
    1983 and detained at the Evin Prison. According to the Tudeh Martyrs book,
    he was tortured so severely that he could not stand and the Guards had to
    move him on a blanket. Trial Mr. Hajari was tried and condemned to life
    imprisonment. There is no information about the trial. Also, there is no
    specific information about the circumstances of trials that condemned this
    defendant and thousands of other political prisoners to death in a few
    months period. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988
    refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of
    executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of
    Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed serving at the
    time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge was
    publicly levelled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who
    do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defence In their
    open letter, the families of the prisoners state that defendants were not
    given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion
    that prisoners were associated with guerrillas troops operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. Over seven years, we witnessed that
    they were denied access to anything that would have allowed them to
    establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such conditions
    the families reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were
    able to engage with the political groups outside Iran. It is possible that
    the prisoners who were members of organizations other than the MKO were
    charge for being "anti religious" and were condemned for insisting on
    their beliefs. Judgment No specific information is available about the
    defendant’s execution. Mr. Hajari was hanged during the mass killings of
    political prisoners in September, 1988.
