    Information regarding the execution of Mr. Ahmad Ra uf Basharidust was
    drawn from the Bidaran website and the web site of the MKO. Mr. Ra uf
    Basharidust was born in Rasht. He was a student at the Rasht Arts High
    School and a sympathizer of the MKO. He was active within the Organization
    and had an underground life. He was arrested once, in April of 1982, by
    the Revolutionary Guards at a Mojahedin base in Rasht. They transferred
    him to the Guards' prison. He was detained in various prisons for five
    years before his release. During this period, he was tortured and spenty
    some time in solitary confinements. According to the Mojahedin website,
    his mother protested him being held in an adult detention center, while
    still being a juvenile, but, she was told by the religious judge that Mr.
    Ra uf Basharidust was to stay in prison because he was very active in the
    MKO and a militia commander. After his release, Mr. Ra'uf Basharidust
    intended to join the Liberation Army in Iraq (those members of the
    Mojahedin who were in Iraq to fight against the Islamic Republic) but, was
    not successful. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. According to the MKO website, Mr. Ra
    ud Basharidust was arrested again at the end of 1987 or the beginning of
    1988. All his family s efforts in trying to find the location of his
    detention were futile. Trial There is no information about the trail
    sessions or its location. Also, there is no specific information about the
    circumstances of such trials that condemned this defendant and thousands
    of other political prisoners to death in a few months period. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving at the time they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    levelled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of
    Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February
    2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities' accusations
    against the prisoners accusations that may have led to their execution.
    These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims
    regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict,
    Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not
    believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also "waging
    war against God" and should be sentenced to death. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available about the defendant s defence. In their open letter, the
    families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrillas operating near the borders, the
    families submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside during
    their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits
    were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone
    every two weeks. We witnessed during the past seven years that they were
    denied access to anything that would have allowed them to establish
    contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such conditions the families
    reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were able to
    engage with the political groups outside Iran. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the defendant s execution sentence. Mr.
    Ra'uf Basharidust was executed during the mass killings of the political
    prisoners in August of 1988. According to the MKO website, three years
    later, the officials of the Information Ministry told his family that he
    was executed in Orumieh. They refused to offer any information about his
    burial place.
