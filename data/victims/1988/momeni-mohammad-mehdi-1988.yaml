    Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mo'meni is one of the victims in the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. Many of the executed prisoners were members
    or sympathizers of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI, also
    known as MKO). However, members or supporters of Marxist Leninist
    organizations such as, the People’s Fedayian of Iran (Minority) or Peykar,
    which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and
    Fadayian Khalq (Majority), which did not oppose the regime, were among the
    victims. Complementary information has been gathered from the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews
    with family members, and memoirs of witnesses by the Boroumand Foundation.
    The information about Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mo'meni is taken from the book
    The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by The Tudeh Party Publications. He
    was a university student. He joined the Tudeh Party before the revolution
    and soon started his activism in the Navid Organization (the underground
    organization of the Tudeh Party). The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in
    1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported the
    policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in
    Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second time following
    the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks from 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members
    were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The details of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mo'meni was
    arrested in May 1983. According to the above book, he was tortured and
    sent to solitary confinement several times. Trial Mr. Mohammad Mehdi
    Mo'meni was tried and condemned to ten years imprisonment. Whether or not
    a second trial condemned him to death is not known. According to the
    available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of
    the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense
    lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee, composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No
    charge has been publicly levelled against the victims of the 1988 mass
    execution. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the accusations against the prisoner that may have led to
    their execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced
    in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor,
    corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against the
    executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's
    members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against
    God" while stating that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken
    by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. It is possible that the prisoners who were members of
    organizations other than the Mojahedin Khalq were charged for being "anti
    religious" and were condemned for insisting on their beliefs. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence provided against
    the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves
    in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with
    guerrilla forces operating near the borders, the families submit the
    isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our
    children lived in most difficult conditions. Our visits were limited to
    ten minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks.
    Over the past seven years, we witnessed that they were denied access to
    anything that would have
