    The information about Mr. Ali Reza Sepasi, son of Ali Akbar, is based on
    an interview by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with his brother and
    an electronic form sent to Omid by him. Mr. Sepasi is also listed among
    3,208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose
    executions were reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity . The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional
    information regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports from the Human Rights organizations, interviews with
    the witnesses and victims families as well as from the Bidaran website.
    [*] According to the existing information, Mr. Sepasi was born in Rasht in
    1958. He was single and a student at Esfahan Technical University. He
    entered the university in 1977 and first studied computer science;
    however, after the revolution, he transferred to agricultural engineering,
    reasoning that his country needed agriculture more than computers. He was
    a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and was arrested two or
    three times for short periods. According to his brother, once he went home
    with a bloody face caused by a fight with Basij members, the family became
    worried. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic s
    leaders. [**] Arrest and detention According to the interviewee, Mr.
    Sepasi disappeared for several days in the spring of 1982. After his
    brother, Bahman, looked for him by going to various institutions, and got
    arrested, his mother went to the Evin prison and found out about her son s
    arrest. The circumstances of Mr. Sepasi s arrest and detention are not
    known. He had no visitation with his family when detained at the Evin
    Prison. However, after he was sentenced and transferred to the Gohardasht
    Prison, he could have monthly visitations with his mother. Only once a
    year could he visit his siblings in addition to his parents. Trial
    According to the interviewee, Mr. Sepasi was tried and condemned to seven
    years imprisonment. According to the testimonies of some of the political
    prisoners who were tried during the executions of the summer of 1988 in
    Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the trials took place in a room on the ground
    floor of the prison after a few weeks of isolation during which prisoners
    were deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor
    time. In August and September, a three-member delegation composed of
    Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor, Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious
    judge, and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry
    of Information, asked prisoners questions about their views on Mojahedin,
    whether they would renounce their beliefs and if they were ready to
    cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the
    prisoners would have been charged with counter revolutionary,
    anti-religion and anti-Islam or associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders and would be sentenced
    to death. The authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s
    purpose and the serious implications of their responses. According to
    survivors, during the summer of 1988 a large number of prisoners
    sympathizing with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not
    recanting their beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988
    refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of
    executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 o
