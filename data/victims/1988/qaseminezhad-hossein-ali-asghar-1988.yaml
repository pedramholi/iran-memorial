    Mr. Hossein Ali Asghar Qaseminezhad’s name, an affiliate of the Tudeh
    Party, is taken from the book Those Who Said No , published in 1999 in
    Paris by the Association for the Defense of Political Prisoners and
    Prisoners of Conscience in Iran. He was a victim of the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports by human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in
    1941. The Tudeh's ideology was Marxist Leninist and it supported the
    former Soviet Union’s policies. The Party played a major role on Iran's
    political scene until it was banned for a second time following the August
    19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh declared Ayatollah
    Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of its
    attacks from 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members were
    imprisoned. Arrest and detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial Specific details about the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Qaseminezhad
    and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with attorneys or
    prosecutors. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official
    secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They
    note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and
    sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already
    completed when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly stated against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities’ accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Defendants, who did not belong to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, may
    have been accused of being “anti-religion” for not having renounced his or
    her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Qaseminezhad’s defense. In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants
    were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same
    letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the
    prison) had collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states
    that such claims “are false considering the circumstances in prisons; for
    our children faced the most difficult conditions [in prison, with]
    visitation rights of once every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten
    minutes through a telephone from behind the glass window, and were
    deprived of any connection with the outside world. We faced such
    conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of our claim.” Judgment
    The details regarding the execution sentence are not available. According
