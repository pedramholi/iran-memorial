    Mr. Majid Taleqani is one of 1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and particulars of
    persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the
    period July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, "in all probability"
    there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were
    members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's
    Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims." Mr. Taleqani is also
    listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization whose execution was reported by the organization in a book
    entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book documents the 1988-89 mass
    execution of political prisoners. Additional information was drawn from
    the Bidaran website and the Mojahedin (MKO) website. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown.
    According to the MKO website, Mr. Taleqani was arrested in 1982 and was
    detained for six years. Trial Mr. Majid Taleqani was first tried and
    condemned to fifteen years imprisonment. Whether or not a second trial
    condemned him to death is not known. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney and
    prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had completed serving
    when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly levelled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the MKO members as "hypocrites" who do
    not believe in Islam and "wage war against God." He decreed that they
    should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense The
    MKO website quotes a prisoner: “An evening in late August of 1988, they
    brought Majid Taleqani to my cell. As soon as he entered, he gave me his
    wrist watch and said: ‘I am now just coming from court. I defended the
    ideological position of my organization and I was condemned to death.’” In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were
    not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed during the past seven
    years that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed
    them to establish contacts outside their prisons walls." Under such
    conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that these
    prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside Iran.
    Judgment No specific information is available about the execution
    sentence. According to the MKO website, Mr. Majid Taleqani was executed at
    Evin prison in late August 1988.
