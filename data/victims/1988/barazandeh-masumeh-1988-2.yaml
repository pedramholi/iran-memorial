    Ms. Ma'sumeh Barazandeh is among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity.
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran and the People’s
    Mojahedin Organization websites. Ms. Ma'sumeh Barazandeh is one of 1,000
    people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission's Special
    Representative's Report titled, "Names and particulars of persons
    allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the period
    July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report specifies that
    although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all probability" there were
    several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were members of the
    Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan
    Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs were
    also said to be among the alleged victims." Ms. Ma'sumeh Barazandeh was
    born in Gachsaran (Do Gonbadan). She was a high school student and a
    sympathizer of the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization. According to
    the Mojahedin website, she was a messenger, as well as responsible for
    helping pass Mojahedin sympathizers across the Iran/Iraq border. Arrest
    and detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest
    and detention. Ms. Ma'sumeh Barazandeh was arrested during her third
    passage across the Iran/Iraq border in 1988 and was transferred to “Do
    Gonbadan”. According to the Mojahedin website, she was tortured severely
    for three months, as a result of which, she couldn’t walk and had to use
    her hands to move around. Trial The circumstances that led to this
    defendant's execution are unknown. However, relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is the proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was publicly leveled against the
    defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners;
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMIO's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available on Ms. Barazandeh's defence. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrillas operating near the borders, the
    families submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside during
    their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits
    were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider via telephone every two
    weeks. We witnessed during the past seven years that they were denied
    access to anything that would have allowed them to establish contacts
    outside their prisons' walls." Under such conditions the families reject
    the authorities’ claim that these prisoners were able to engage with the
    political groups outside Iran. Judgment No specific information is
    available about this execution. Ms. Barazandeh was hanged in the main
    square of Gachsaran in 1988.
