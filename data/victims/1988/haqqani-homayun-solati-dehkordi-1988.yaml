    The information about Mr. Homayun Solati Dehkordi Haqqani, son of
    Shamsollah, has been sent to Omid by a relative via an electronic form.
    Mr. Solati (mistyped Salavati) is also among 3208 members and sympathizers
    of the People’s Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass executions of political prisoners.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs.
    Mr. Solati was born in Tehran in 1960. His father was a colonel and head
    of the police department of Kordestan province before the 1979 Revolution.
    The sender of the electronic form remembers Mr. Solati as a “brilliant and
    intelligent” student who went to high school in Tehran. Due to his good
    grades, he was admitted to the Esfahan University of Science and
    Technology. He then continued his education outside Iran. At the time of
    the Revolution, he became interested in politics and returned to Iran. He
    studied engineering in infrastructure. Arrest and detention There is no
    detail on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Mr. Solati was arrested at
    the age of 20 in 1980. He was imprisoned for 8 years. According to the
    sender of the form, “in prison, he found out more about the repression and
    cruelty of the regime, and became more resolute in his political beliefs.
    Even in his monthly visits, he fearlessly spoke of the repression.” Trial
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Solati and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not
    known. According to existing information, there was no official trial with
    the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in
    1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about
    their beliefs and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges Mr. Solati was arrested in 1980 and charged with “reading
    the publication of the PMOI.” The official charge that led to his
    execution in 1988 is not known. No charge has been publicly leveled
    against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the
    Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being “counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who do not
    believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also “waging
    war against God” and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Solati’s defense. In their open letter, the families of
    the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that
    these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed
    members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed forces of the
    Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are false considering the
    circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most difficult conditions
    [in prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15 days, each visitation
    lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind the glass window, and
    were deprived of any connection with the outside world. We faced such
    conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of our claim.” Judgment
    The details regarding the execution sentence are not available. Mr.
    Homayun Solati Dehkordi H
