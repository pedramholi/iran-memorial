    Mr. Seyed Ali Ganji, son of Seyed Taqi and born in 1951 in Eqlid (Fars
    Province) was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in
    1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs.
    The information about Mr. Ganji has been drawn from an electronic form
    sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. Mr. Ganji taught
    mathematics in a high school and was affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq
    Orhanization. Arrest and detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention, other than Mr. Ganji was arrested in
    Eqlid and taken to Adelabad Prison in Shiraz. Trial Specific details on
    the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Ganji and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with the presence of an
    attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges According to the electronic form, Mr. Ganji
    was charged with “membership in the Mojahedin Khalq Organization” and
    “opposition to [the regime of] the Islamic Republic.” Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ganji’s defense. In their open letter, the families of
    the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that
    these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed
    members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed forces of the
    Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are false considering the
    circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most difficult conditions
    [in prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15 days, each visitation
    lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind the glass window, and
    were deprived of any connection with the outside world. We faced such
    conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of our claim.” Judgment
    The details regarding the execution sentence are not available. Mr. Seyed
    Ali Ganji was executed at Adelabad prison in Shiraz in 1988. Months after
    the executions, prison authorities informed the families about the
    executions and handed in the victims’ belongings to their families. The
    bodies, however, were not returned to them. The bodies were buried in mass
    graves. Authorities warned the families of prisoners against holding
    memorial ceremonies.
