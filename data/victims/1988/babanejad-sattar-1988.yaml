    Mr. Sattar Babanejad is one of the victims in the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In addition to members
    of those Marxist-Leninist organizations oppose to the Islamic Republic,
    activists of organizations that were not against the Islamic Republic were
    also among the victims of these mass killings. The information about Mr.
    Sattar Babanejad is taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs by The Tudeh
    Party of Iran Publications. He was born in Ardebil. He was a student
    majoring in Civil Engineering and worked in a private company. The Tudeh
    Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported the former Soviet Union's policies. The
    Party played a major role in Iran's political scene until it was banned
    for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the
    new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are unknown. Mr.
    Sattar Babanejad was arrested in 1982. His was detained at Evin and
    Gohardasht prisons. He had some visits with his family; but, there is no
    information about these visits. According to the above source, in 1987,
    they transferred some prisoners from Evin to Gohardasht Prison. These
    prisoners had completed their sentence but had not been released. In order
    to put more pressure on them, they were beaten. At this time, he fought
    back against the guard and was beaten. As a result, with the danger of
    losing his vision, he was transferred to the hospital. His mother was
    informed of this the next time she came to visit. Trial According to the
    above book, the first trial of this defendant was held at Evin prison
    during the fall of 1984. They ruled he could go free if he repented but he
    refused. There is no more specific information of this or any such trials
    that condemned thousands of political prisoners to their death in a few
    months period. According to the available information, the Iranian
    authorities did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court
    with in the presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed
    in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member special committee, composed
    of a religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and
    the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners
    about their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    the political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the
    judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran.
    In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they
    argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of
    their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving at the time they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge was publicly levelled
    against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988),
    and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the
    prisoners accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as
    "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and
    decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this
    organization are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to
    death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families
    of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were
    associated with guerrillas operating near the borders, the families submit
    the isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention:
    "Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to
    10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We
    witnessed, over the past seven years, that they were den
