    The information about Mr. Fayez Seyedipur, son of Hossein, was sent to
    Omid via an electronic form by a person close to him. He was a victim of
    the mass killing of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the
    executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO).* Other victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Information about
    the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the
    memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports by human rights organizations,
    interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Mr. Seyedipur
    was born in 1961 in Soq (in the Kohgilueh and Boyer Ahmad provinces). He
    was a school teacher. Before the 1979 revolution, he began his political
    activity as a sympathizer of the MKO. He was arrested in 1981 and
    sentenced to three months imprisonment and permanent denial of state
    services, including being barred from employment at the Ministry of
    Education, which employs school and university teachers. Therefore, after
    he served his sentence, Mr. Seyedipur could not return to work as a
    teacher. He instead worked in a store. Arrest and detention One day in
    1984, Mr. Seyedipur was arrested at the store where he worked in Dehesht
    (in the Kohgilueh and Boyer Ahmad provinces). The reason for the arrest
    was announced as “sympathizing with, promoting, and recruiting for the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization.” Accompanied by ten Revolutionary Guards,
    Mr. Seyedipur was brought to Soq, where he lived. The Guards searched his
    house and confiscated his personal belongings, including books,
    hand-written notes, and cash. Mr. Seyedipur was first detained at the
    detention center of the Revolutionary Guards headquarters in Dehesht and
    later transferred to Gachsaran Prison (also in the Kohgilueh and Boyer
    Ahmad provinces). He was then taken to Adel Abad Prison in Shiraz. For a
    few months after arrest, his family members did not know anything about
    him. After he was condemned to ten years imprisonment, they were allowed
    to visit him in prison. Based on his own statements, Mr. Seyedipur was
    under interrogation for six months and he did not see any light for the
    entire period (he was blindfolded or kept in the dark), and was flogged
    almost daily. Trial Mr. Seyedipur was tried in Gachsaran Prison about six
    months after arrest and sentenced to ten years in prison. Based on the
    information available, there was an appeals court in Dehdasht that
    confirmed this ruling. Specific details about the circumstances of the
    trials that led to the execution of Mr. Seyedipur and thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. What is known, however, is that there
    was no official trial with attorneys or prosecutors. Those who were
    executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to Minister of Justice at the
    time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges In the first trial, Mr. Seyedipur
    was charged with “membership in the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and
    activism with this organization.” No charge has been publicly stated
    against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the
    Minister of Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting
    Iran in February 2003, the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities’ accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
