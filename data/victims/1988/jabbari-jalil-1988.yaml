    Information about Mr. Jalil Jabbari Mostahsen, son of Khalil, was gathered
    from an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person
    familiar with this case. According to this information, he was born in
    1952. He was married and had two children. He was educated in industrial
    engineering. Mr. Jabbari Mostahsen is also cited in the list Yadnameh,
    published by the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, Majority Branch (April 2002:
    Koln). He was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in
    1988. The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information
    regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri,
    reports from the human rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses
    and victims families, as well as from the Bidaran website. The majority of
    the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    Other victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist-Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. After the 1979
    Revolution, the organization, which renounced armed struggle, split over
    their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Majority supported and considered the Islamic Republic as a
    revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime. After the spring of 1983,
    however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely because of their
    political beliefs. Arrest and detention Mr. Jabbari Mostahsen was arrested
    and transferred to Evin Prison on November 3, 1986. There is no specific
    information on his arrest and detention. Trial Specific details about the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Jabbari
    Mostahsen are unknown. According to the testimonies of leftist political
    prisoners who were tried in Gohardasht Prison during the executions of the
    summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the
    prison after a few weeks of isolation, during which prisoners were
    deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time.
    Toward the end of August, a three-member delegation composed of
    Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious
    judge; and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry
    of Information, asked prisoners questions about whether they were Muslim
    or Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were practicing
    Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the latter were sentenced to be
    hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The authorities never
    informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious
    implications of their responses. During the summer of 1988, according to
    survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or
    Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to the Minister of Justice at the time,
    Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly stated
    against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. Based on the testimonies
    of those who were in prisons in the summer of 1988, the questions to the
    three-member committee from the leftist prisoners were about their
    beliefs, and they were accused of being anti-religion, insisting on their
    beliefs and not repenting. In their letters to the Minister of Justice in
    1988, and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against the
    prisoners accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An edict of the Leader
    of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as hypocrites, who do not believe in Islam and who wage war
    against God and decree that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also waging war against Go
