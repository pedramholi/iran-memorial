    Mr. Salman Qasemi is one of 1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission’s Special Representative’s Report, “Names and particulars of
    persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the
    period July-December 1988,” published January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, “in all probability”
    there were several thousand victims. “Most of the alleged victims were
    members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People’s
    Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims.” Additional information
    has been sent to Omid via an electronic form. According to this form, he
    was born in Shekaryazi, near the city of Salmas (West Azarbaijan
    province). Arrest and detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Qasemi and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with the presence of an
    attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This
    committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs
    and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of
    the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against
    the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization
    named by the leader of the Islamic Republic, may have been accused of
    being “anti-religion” for not having renounced his or her beliefs.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Qasemi’s defense. In their open letter,
    the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the
    accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated
    with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed
    forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are false
    considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most
    difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15
    days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind
    the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the outside
    world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of
    our claim.” Judgment The details regarding the execution sentence are not
    available. According to available information, leftist prisoners executed
    in 1988 were found to be “apostates.” Months after the executions, prison
    authorities informed the families about the executions and handed in the
    victims’ belongings to their families. The bodies, however, were not
    returned to them. The bodies were buried in mass graves. Authorities
    warned the families of prisoners against holding memorial ceremonies.
