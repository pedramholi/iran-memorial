    Ms. Siminazar Hedayat Monfared is one of the victims of the 1988-89 mass
    execution of political prisoners in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Many of
    the executed prisoners were members or sympathizers of the People’s
    Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI, also known as MKO). However, members
    or supporters of Marxist Leninist organizations such as, the People’s
    Fedayin of Iran (Minority) or Peykar, which opposed the Islamic Republic,
    as well as the Tudeh Party and Fadayian Khalq (Majority), which did not
    oppose the regime, were among the victims. Complementary information has
    been gathered from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human
    rights organizations, interviews with family members, and memoirs of
    witnesses by the Boroumand Foundation. Additional information about Ms.
    Hedayat Monfared, daughter of Ya’qub, has been drawn from a few electronic
    forms sent to Omid by individuals familiar with this case. She was born in
    Gachsaran (Dogonbadan) in Boyr-Ahmad va Kohkiluyeh province. She was an
    accounting student at the private university of Yasuj. Arrest and
    detention Ms. Hedayat Monfared was arrested in 1987 in Yasuj and charged
    with cooperation with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. According to the
    available information, she was given a temporary leave of absence from
    prison the same year. No further detail is available about her arrest and
    detention. Trial A closed trial condemned Ms. Hedayat Monfared to one year
    imprisonment, and subsequently she was transferred to Shiraz. Whether or
    not there was a second trial that condemned her to death is not know.
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Ms. Hedayat Monfared and thousands of other individuals in
    1988 are not known. According to the available information, the Iranian
    authorities did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court
    with in the presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed
    in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member special committee, composed
    of a religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and
    the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners
    about their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges The official charge brought against Ms.
    Hedayat Monfared after her arrest was cooperation with the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of
    the 1988 mass execution. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities’ accusations against
    the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as
    "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and
    decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this
    organization are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to
    death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on her defense. In their open letter, the
    families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the
    accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated
    with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed
    forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claim “are false
    considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most
    difficult conditions [in the prison, with] visitation rights of once every
    15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone from
    behind the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the
    outside world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the
    truth of our claim.” Judgment The details of death sentence are not known.
    Based on the available information, Mr. Si
