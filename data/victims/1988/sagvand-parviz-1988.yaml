    Mr. Parviz Sagvand is listed among 3208 members and sympathizers of the
    People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    This book documents the 1988-1989 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran website and the web site
    of the PMIO. He was born in Andimeshk and a high school graduate. Arrest
    and Detention The exact circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Mr. Parviz Sagvand was arrested in 1986. He was
    detained in Dezful prison. Trial There is no specific information about
    the circumstances of the trials that condemned this defendant and
    thousands of other political prisoners to death in a period of a few
    months. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed at the time they were retried
    and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly levelled
    against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988),
    and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities’ accusations against the
    prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims
    regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict,
    Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI members as “hypocrites” who do not
    believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also “waging
    war against God” and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of Guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available about Mr. Sagvand’s defense. In their open letter, the families
    of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were
    associated with guerrillas operating near the borders, the families submit
    the isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention:
    “Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to
    10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We
    witnessed during the past seven years that they were denied access to
    anything that would have allowed them to establish contacts outside their
    prisons walls.” Under such conditions the families reject the claim of the
    authorities that these prisoners were able to engage with the political
    groups outside Iran. Judgment No specific information is available about
    the execution verdict. Mr. Parviz Sagvand was executed by a firing squad
    during the mass killings of political prisoners in Dezful on August 5,
    1988.
