    Mr. Behzad Omrani, a sympathizer of the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority), was a
    victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority
    of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs.
    The Fadaiyian Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyian Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic
    and was active mainly in the political arena and the labor movement.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Behzad Omrani was arrested during an armed
    demonstration organized by the Mojahedin Khalq on September 27, 1981. The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Following the repression of the demonstration of June 20, 1981, which
    protested the parliament’s impeachment of President Banisadr and the
    Islamic Republic’s systematic policy of excluding the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization from the country’s political scene, and the mass executions
    that followed the demonstration, the MKO turned to armed opposition to the
    regime of the Islamic Republic. The MKO sought to organize demonstrations
    in order to attract public support and overthrow the regime. The
    demonstration of September 27, 1981, was such an event in which many of
    the MKO sympathizers were arrested. According to official newspapers, the
    demonstration resulted in the death of several Revolutionary Guards,
    supporters of the MKO, as well as some bystanders. Two days later, the
    Kayhan newspaper announced the execution of 54 demonstrators. Trial During
    his first trial, Mr. Omrani was condemned to 8 years imprisonment. One
    year before his sentence was complete, he was executed in 1988. There is
    no specific information about the circumstances of the trials that
    condemned this defendant and thousands of other political prisoners to
    death within a few months period. According to existing information, there
    was no official trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor.
    Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee
    consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence
    Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor from Tehran. This committee asked the
    leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether or not
    they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in
    1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No
    information is available on Mr. Omrani’s charges. No charge has been
    publicly levelled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities’
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being “counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization’s
    members as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war against
    God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken
    by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. It is possible that the prisoners who were members of
    organizations other than the Mojahedin Khalq were charged with being
    “anti-religious” and were condemned for insisting on their beliefs.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
