    Information about Mr. Morteza Khordad was gathered from an electronic form
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation by his cellmate. Mr. Khordad is also
    listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, whose executions were reported by that organization in a
    book entitled Crime Against Humanity . The Boroumand Foundation has
    collected additional information regarding the 1988 massacre from the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human rights organizations,
    interviews with the witnesses and victims families, as well as from the
    Bidaran website. * Mr. Khordad, 29, was born in Shiraz. He was a high
    school graduate and a student at Shiraz Electronic Industries. He was a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released,
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new member based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost in the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. ** Arrest and Detention According
    to information from the electronic form, Mr. Khordad was probably arrested
    at his place of education and transferred to the Revolutionary Guards
    detention center in Shiraz. The person sending the electronic form had
    been his cellmate from November 8 to December 8, 1982. Later he saw
    Morteza at the Adelabad prison. No specific information is available on
    Mr. Morteza Khordad's arrest and detention. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Khordad s trial. According to the testimonies of some of
    the political prisoners who were tried during the executions of the summer
    of 1988 in some of the prisons, the trials took place in a room in the
    prison after a few weeks of isolation during which prisoners were deprived
    of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In
    August and September, a three-member delegation composed of the public
    prosecutor, a religious judge, and a representative of the Ministry of
    Information asked prisoners questions about their views on Mojahedin,
    whether they would renounce their beliefs and if they were ready to
    cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the
    prisoners would have been charged with counter revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam, or associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders, and would be sentenced
    to death. The authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s
    purpose and the serious implications of their responses. According to
    survivors, during the summer of 1988, a large number of prisoners
    sympathizing with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not
    recanting their beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988
    refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of
    executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then-Minister of
    Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding
    these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an
    overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to
    prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed when
    they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their
    letters to the Minister of Justice (1988) and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have
    led to their executions. These accusations include being
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being ass
