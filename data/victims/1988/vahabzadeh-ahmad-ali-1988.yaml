    He was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but he was hanged during this
    sentence. News and information about the execution of Mr. Ahmad Ali
    Vahabzadeh, son of Ahmad (Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran*), one of
    the victims of the mass execution of political prisoners in 1988, was sent
    to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center vi an electronic form by a person close to
    him (e-form October 24, 2021). Mr. Vahabzadeh s name is also listed among
    the one thousand people whose execution was recorded in a report published
    by the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Iran (October
    24, 2021). This list has been compiled under the title Names and
    descriptions of people who are said to have been executed by the Islamic
    Republic of Iran from June to December 1988 . According to this report,
    although only a thousand people are named in this list, there is a strong
    possibility that the victims actually numbered in the several thousands,
    and that most of them were members of the Mojahedin e Khalq Orgnization.
    The majority of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims families, and witnesses memoirs.
    According to available information, Mr. Vahabzadeh was born in Tehran. He
    was single, and he was a ninth-grade student in high school. After the
    1979 revolution, he joined the student branch of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in the Islamic Student Association of Andisheh High School.
    He received ideological and organizational training in this organization
    and he was an active militia in that department. (Mojahedin e Khalq
    Organization). According to his comrades: He loved the mountains and he
    spent his weekends in the mountains in the north of Tehran. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Vahabzadeh was arrested on December 10, 1981, at about 5 pm,
    at the intersection of Pasdaran and Bustan III streets, by prosecution
    officers from Evin Prison in Tehran. They took him to Evin Prison. He was
    only 16 when he was arrested. At the time of his arrest, Mr. Vahabzadeh
    did not have anything on him. He had left the house in his slippers to get
    a newspaper. According to the interviewee, he was tortured. After he was
    hit on the head, he fell into a coma that lasted for two weeks. Dr. Sheikh
    ol Eslami, who was the Evin Prison s doctor at the time, was able to bring
    him out of the coma by extracting some spinal fluid. After that, he was
    not interrogated anymore (e-form October 24, 2021). Two weeks after he was
    arrested, prison officials confirmed that he was in Evin Prison. According
    to one of Mr. Vahabzadeh s cellmates, who had met with his family upon his
    release from prison, Evin prosecution officers had brought someone in a
    Mercedes Benz to meet Mr. Vahabzadeh, and he had identified him. He was
    incarcerated in Evin, Qezel Hesar, and Gohardasht Prisons. Visiting days
    happened once every two weeks at Evin, Qezel Hesar, and Gohardasht
    Prisons. During the seven years he spent in prison, he was able to meet
    with his family two times. Visits were often interrupted ( e-form October
    24, 2021 ). In the winter of 1988, he was transferred to Evin Prison for
    the last time: In the meeting that he had with his father in the spring of
    1988, he had become gaunt and his skin was yellowish, due to extended
    hunger strikes. But his sunken eyes were bright. His father asked him,
    Dear Ali, what are you going to do after you are released? He said, We
    will go to Towchal summit together! During these darkest days in the
    history of Iran, he knew better than anyone that there was not going to be
    a release. But he spoke about the future with such conviction that he
    conveyed this faith to other people. (Mojahedin e Khalq Organization)
    Trial Mr. Vahabzadeh was first put on trial in Evin Prison in the spring
    of 1982 (there is no date). No information is available on his trial. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Vahabzadeh in
    his first trial are not clear. According to one of his close associates,
    Involvement with the Mojahedin was undoubtedly one of his charges.
