    Mr. Ra'uf Baladi was a victim in the mass killings of political prisoners
    in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organizatio (MKO). In addition to members of those
    Marxist-Leninist organizations oppose to the Islamic Republic, activists
    of organizations that were not against the Islamic Republic were also
    among the victims of these mass killings. The information about Mr. Ra'uf
    Baladi is taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs by The Tudeh Party of Iran
    Publications. He was born in Kermanshah. He graduated with a degree in
    Interior Design from a university in Italy. He made his living there by
    selling his paintings. After the revolution, he returned to Iran and went
    to his birthplace, Kermanshah, and taught English. The Tudeh Party of Iran
    was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it
    supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major
    role in Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second time
    following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party
    declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention In 1983, he was
    arrested and detained for 18 months. The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Ra'uf Baladi was arrested for the
    second time in 1988. His held at Dizelabad prison (in Kermanshah) and at
    Gohardasht prisons (near Karaj). Trial Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Baladi and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to the
    available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of
    the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense
    lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee, composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No
    charge was ever publicly levelled against the defendant. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities' accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as
    "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and
    decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this
    organization are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to
    death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families
    of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were
    associated with guerrilla forces operating near the borders, the families
    submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside during their
    detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were
    limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two
    weeks. We witnessed, over the past seven years, that they were denied
    access to anything that would have allowed them to establish contacts
    outside their prisons' walls." Under such conditions the families reject
    the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were able to engage with
    the political groups outside Iran. It is possible that the prisoners who
    were members of organizations other than the MKO were charge for being
    "anti religious" and were condemned for insisting on their beliefs.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ra'uf Baladi to death. He
