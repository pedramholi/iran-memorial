    Mr. Akbar Khatibi is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and Particulars of
    Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the
    period July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all probability"
    there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were
    members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's
    Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization along with 11
    mollahs were said to be among the alleged victims." The information about
    Mr. Khatibi is taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001 by
    The Tudeh Party of Iran publications He was born in Qom. He joined the
    Youth Organization of the Tudeh Party when he was 16 years old. After the
    coup on August 19, 1953, he was arrested and detained for nine months.
    After his release, he entered Tehran University. He was an employee of the
    Labor and Social Affairs Ministry. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in
    1941. The Tudeh's ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies
    of the former Soviet Union's. The Tudeh Party played a major role in
    Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second time following
    the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh Party
    declared that the Ayatollah Khomeini and his Islamic Republic regime were
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of its attacks from 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr.
    Khatibi was arrested at his home in 1983. He was detained in the Evin and
    Qezelhesar prisons. According to the Tudeh Martyrs book, he was tortured
    during his nine-month detention in the Evin prison. Trial According to the
    above book, Mr. Khatibi was tried three years after his arrest and
    condemned to six years imprisonment. There is no information about the
    trial. Also, there is no specific information about the circumstances of
    such trials that condemned this defendant and thousands of other political
    prisoners to death in a few months period. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refuted the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was publicly levelled against the
    defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners –
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were
    not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla troops operating
    near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives
    from the outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most
    difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass
    divider through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed, over the past
    seven years, that they were denied access to anything that would have
    allowed them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under
    such conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that
    these prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside
    Iran. It is possible that the prisoners who were members of organizations
    other than the Mojahedin Khalq were charge for being "anti religious" and
    were condemned for insisting on their beliefs. Judgment No
