    Mr. Ja’far Maqami is one victim of the 1988-89 mass execution of political
    prisoners in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Many of the executed prisoners
    were members or sympathizers of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of
    Iran (PMOI, also known as MKO). However, members or supporters of Marxist
    Leninist organizations, such as the People’s Fadaiyan of Iran (Minority)
    or Peykar, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party
    and Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not oppose the regime, were among
    the victims. Complementary information has been gathered from the memoirs
    of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews
    with family members, and memoirs of witnesses, all provided to the
    Boroumand Foundation. News of the execution of Mr. Ja’far Maqami was also
    published by Andishe-va-Peykar in 1995 in the book “An Unequal Battle: a
    report of seven years in prison, from 1982 to 1989” by Nima Parvaresh.
    According to this report, Mr. Ja’far Maqami was a sympathizer of the
    Peykar Organization. He was 30 years old and a student pilot training to
    fly F14 jets. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention According to Mr. Nima Parvaresh’s report,
    Mr. Ja’far Maqami was arrested when distributing pamphlets for the Peykar
    Organizatin in Qom in 1980. There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Ja’far Maqami
    and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of
    the 1988 mass execution in a court with the presence of defense lawyers.
    The prisoners executed in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member
    special committee composed of a religious judge, a representative of the
    Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned
    the leftist prisoners about their beliefs, and their faith in God and
    religion. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice,
    Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been leveled
    publicly against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of
    Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February
    2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities' accusations
    against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution.
    These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as
    "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and
    decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this
    organization are also "waging war against God," and should be sentenced to
    death. Defendants who did not belong to the organization named by the
    leader of the Islamic Republic may have been accused of being
    "anti-religion" for not having renounced their beliefs. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available on Mr. Ja’far Maqami’s defence. In their open letter, the
    families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the
    accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison)
