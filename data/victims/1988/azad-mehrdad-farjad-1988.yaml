    Mr. Mehrdad Farjad Azad is one of 1000 people listed in a UN Human Rights
    Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and particulars of
    persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the
    period July-December 1988," published on January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, "in all probability"
    there were several thousand victims. The report further notes that: "most
    of the alleged victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of
    the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims." Additional information about Mr. Farjad Azad’s is drawn from two
    electronic forms sent to Omid, by individuals familiar with this case. He
    was born in Tehran in 1945. Arrest and detention Mr. Farjad Azad was
    reportedly arrested on February 3, 1983 for being a member of the Tudeh
    Party. No other detail is known. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in
    1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist- Leninist and it supported
    policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in
    Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second time following
    the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members
    were imprisoned. Trial The circumstances that led to this defendant's
    execution are unknown. According to the available information, the Iranian
    authorities did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court
    with in the presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed
    in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member special committee, composed
    of a religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and
    the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners
    about their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners killed in the summer and fall of 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is the proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority
    of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which
    they were either serving or had already completed serving, at the time
    they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly leveled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners; accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced
    in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor,
    corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against the
    executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's
    members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against
    God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken
    by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    regarding the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense In their
    open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not
    given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion
    that prisoners were associated with guerillas operating near the borders,
    the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside
    during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions.
    Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a
    telephone every two weeks. We witnessed during the past seven years that
    they were denied access to anything that would have allowed them to
    establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such conditions
    the families reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were
    able to engage with any political group outside Iran. It is very possible
    that the prisoners who were members of organizations other than the
    Mojahedin Khalq were charge for being "anti religious" and were condemned
    for insisting on their beliefs. Judgment No information is available about
    the verdict leading to this execution. Mr. Mehrdad Farjad Azad was
    executed during the mass killings of political pris
