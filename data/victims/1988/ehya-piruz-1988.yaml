    The information regarding Mr. Piruz Ehya s execution was sent to Omid via
    two electronic forms by individuals familiar with his case. Mr. Ehya, a
    father of two, was a student at the Elm-o-San at University in Tehran and
    a teacher. According to the available information, he was expelled from
    university and from his teaching position for political reasons. He was a
    sympathizer of the Fadayian Khalq Organization Aksariat (Majority
    faction). Mr. Ehya is also listed in the memorial, Yadnameh , published by
    the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, Majority Branch (April 2002: Koln). He
    was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The
    majority of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports by human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims families, and witnesses memoirs.
    The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    After the 1979 Revolution, the organization, which renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority supported and considered the
    Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime. After the
    spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely
    because of their political beliefs. Arrest and detention According to the
    forms, Mr. Ehya was arrested in the fall of 1986 at his house in Tehran.
    He was detained at the Evin Prison. No further information is available
    regarding his arrest and detention. Trial Specific details about the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Ehya and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with attorneys or
    prosecutors. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official
    secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They
    note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and
    sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already
    completed when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly stated against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being
    associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as hypocrites who do
    not believe in Islam and wage war against God and decrees that prisoners
    who still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also
    waging war against God and should be sentenced to death. Defendants, who
    did not belong to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, may have been accused
    of being anti-religion for not having renounced his or her beliefs.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Ehya s defense. In their open letter,
    the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the
    accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated
    with armed members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in clashes with
    armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims are false
    considering the circumstances in prisons; for our c
