    Mr. Behruz Akrami is named by the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, Minority
    Branch, as an affiliate of the organization who was executed in Iran after
    the 1979 revolution (September 2009). He was a victim of the mass killings
    of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners
    were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports by human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly in the
    political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial
    Specific details about the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Akrami and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not
    known. According to existing information, there was no official trial with
    attorneys or prosecutors. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This
    committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs
    and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue
    that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed when they were retried and sentenced to death.
    Charges No charge has been publicly stated against the victims of the 1988
    mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988, and
    to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the families
    of the victims refer to the authorities’ accusations against the prisoners
    – accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as
    well as being “associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, may have been accused of being “anti-religion” for not
    having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Akrami’s
    defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners noted that
    defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court.
    The same letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners (from
    inside the prison) had collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic Republic,
    states that such claims “are false considering the circumstances in
    prisons; for our children faced the most difficult conditions [in prison,
    with] visitation rights of once every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten
    minutes through a telephone from behind the glass window, and were
    deprived of any connection with the outside world. We faced such
    conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of our claim.” Judgment
    The details regarding the execution sentence are not available. According
    to available information, leftist prisoners executed in 1988 were found to
    be “apostates.” Months after the executions, prison authorities informed
    the families about the executions and hand
