    Information about Mr. Taher Va ezi was gathered from an electronic form
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with this case. Mr.
    Taher Va ezi is also listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were reported by the
    organization in a book titled Crime Against Humanity . He is also one of
    1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission Special
    Representative s Report published on January 26, 1989. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with witnesses and victims families, as
    well as from the Bidaran website. * Mr. Taher Va ezi was born in Hashtrud
    in 1954. He was a medical student at Tabriz University. After the
    revolution, he became the Head of Hospital Council in Hashtrud. He joined
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1980 and went underground after June
    20, 1981. According to the electronic form, he was an anesthesia
    technician in the operation room. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as
    its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam
    was revolutionary, and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a
    split within the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January
    of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along
    with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to
    recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution
    and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were central to the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic s leaders. ** Arrest and detention
    According to the Mojahedin Khalq website, Mr. Taher Va ezi was identified
    and arrested during a trip to Hashtrud. No further information is
    available on his arrest and detention. Trial According to the Mojahedin
    Khalq website, a court had tried and condemned Mr. Taher Va ezi, first to
    15 years and later to life imprisonment. No information is available on
    his second trial. According to the testimonies of some of the political
    prisoners who were tried during the executions in the summer of 1988 in
    some of the prisons, the trials took place in a room in the prison after a
    few weeks of isolation, during which prisoners were deprived of
    visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August
    and September, a three-member delegation composed of the public
    prosecutor, a religious judge, and a representative of the Ministry of
    Information asked prisoners questions about their views regarding the
    Mojahedin, whether they would renounce their beliefs, and if they were
    ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were,
    the prisoners would have been charged with counter revolutionary,
    anti-religion and anti-Islam, or associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders, and would be sentenced
    to death. The authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s
    purpose and the serious implications of their responses. During the summer
    of 1988, according to survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing
    with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their
    beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then-Minister of Justice,
    Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988) and to the UN Special Rapporteur
