    Mr. Raf'at Mohammadzadeh was a victim in the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In addition to members of those
    Marxist-Leninist organizations oppose to the Islamic Republic such as the
    Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, activists of
    organizations such as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority)
    that were not against the Islamic Republic, were also among the victims of
    these mass killings. Mr. Rafat Mohammad-Zadeh is one of 1000 people
    identified in a UN Human Rights Commission's Special Representative's
    Report, "Names and particulars of persons allegedly executed by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran during the period July-December 1988," published
    January 26, 1989. The report specifies that although 1000 names are
    mentioned, "in all probability" there were several thousand victims. "Most
    of the alleged victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of
    the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims." The detailed information about Mr. Raf'at Mohammadzadeh is taken
    from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party by The Tudeh Party of Iran
    Publications. He graduated from the Military College. He was a police
    officer and a member of the Tudeh Party. In 1950, he helped ten leaders of
    the Tudeh Party escape from Qasr prison. In 1954, he left the country and
    several years alter, became a member of the Tudeh Party Central Committee.
    He was in charge of the Donya publication. After the revolution, he
    returned to Iran. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh
    ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the former
    Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran's political scene
    until it was banned for the second time following the August 19, 1953
    coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and
    the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and
    actively supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed
    the Islamic Republic, it became the target of government attacks in 1982
    when most of the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Raf'at Mohammadzadeh was arrested in February 1983. He was
    held at the prison of the Joint Committee and at Evin. The above book
    quotes one of his cellmates, who saw Mr. Mohammadzadeh at Evin prison in
    the summer of 1984, saying: "his hand was paralyzed due to contortion and
    being hung from the ceiling." Contortion was a commonly used interrogation
    method in which one hand from over the head is cuffed or tied to the other
    hand from behind the body at the back of the prisoner. The pressure may be
    so much as to break the shoulder blades. To increase the pain inflicted,
    the body is may be suspended in the air. Trial Mr. Raf'at Mohammadzadeh
    was initially tried and condemned to imprisonment. Whether or not a second
    trial condemned him to death is unknown. According to the available
    information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of the 1988
    mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense lawyer. The
    prisoners had been questioned by a three-member special committee,
    composed of a religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence
    Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist
    prisoners about their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving at the time they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge was ever publicly
    levelled against the victims of the 1988 mass execution. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities' accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as
    "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and
    decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positio
