    The information about Mr. Hossein Khoshgoftar has been sent to Omid, via
    an electronic form, by a relative. Mr. Khoshgoftar is among 3208 members
    and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    His name is also mentioned among 1000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission’s Special Representative’s Report, “Names and
    particulars of persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    during the period July-December 1988,” published January 26, 1989. The
    report specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, “in all
    probability” there were several thousand victims. “Most of the alleged
    victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh
    Party, People’s Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims.” Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the
    Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of
    human rights organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and
    witnesses’ memoirs. Mr. Khoshgoftar was born in 1961 in Qom. He was a
    mathematics student in Tehran University and affiliated with the Mojahedin
    Khlaq Organization. Arrest and detention There is no specific information
    on the defendant’s arrest and detention, other than he was arrested in
    1981 in Amol (Mazandaran province). During his detention and imprisonment,
    he wrote to his parents and had visits with them every other week. Trial
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Khoshgoftar and thousands of other individuals in 1988
    are not known. According to existing information, there was no official
    trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were
    executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges Mr. Khoshgoftar had been arrested
    due to “membership of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.” No charge has
    been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In
    their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Khoshgoftar’s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting
    the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had
    collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes
    with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are
    false considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced
    most difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once
    every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone
    from behind the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the
    outside world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the
    truth of our claim.” Judgment The details regarding the execution sentence
    are not available. According to available information, Mr. Hossein
    Khoshgoftar was executed in Evin prison in the summer of 1988. Months
