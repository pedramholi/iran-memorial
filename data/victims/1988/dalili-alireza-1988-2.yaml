    Mr. Alireza Dalili was one of the victims in the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In addition to members
    of Marxist-Leninist organizations opposed to the Islamic Republic such as
    the Fadayian Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, activists of
    other organizations such as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Majority) that were not against the Islamic Republic, were also among the
    victims of this mass killings. The information about Mr. Dalili is taken
    from the book The Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001 by The Tudeh Party of
    Iran publications He graduated from the Technical University of Tehran in
    chemical engineering. He worked at the Ahvaz Steel Complex. Before the
    Revolution, along with his brother, Mohammad Reza, (who was executed at
    the same time), he joined the Navid Organization, the Tudeh Party’s
    underground organization. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The
    Tudeh's ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the
    former Soviet Union. The Tudeh Party played a major role in Iran's
    political scene until it was banned for the second time following the
    August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh Party declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and his Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks by 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members
    were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown. According to the book The
    Tudeh Martyrs , Mr. Dalili was arrested on April 27, 1983. He was first
    taken to the Joint Committee Prison and then to the Evin Prison. He was
    kept in solitary confinement on several occasions and he was subjected to
    several mock executions. Trial Mr. Dalili was tried in 1985. But, no
    charge was declared against him. There is no information about the trial.
    Also, there is no specific information about the circumstances of such
    trials that condemned this defendant and thousands of other political
    prisoners to death in a few months period. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refuted the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argued that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was publicly levelled against the
    defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners –
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were
    not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla troops operating
    near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives
    from the outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most
    difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass
    divider through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed, over the past
    seven years, that they were denied access to anything that would have
    allowed them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under
    such conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that
    these prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside
    Iran. It is possible that the prisoners who were members of organizations
    other than the MKO were charge for being "anti religious" and were
    condemned for insisting on their beliefs. Judgment No specific information
    is available about the defendant’s execution. Mr. Dalili was hanged during
