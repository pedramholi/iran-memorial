    Mr. Shahriar Feizi is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran website and the PMIO
    website. He was born in Ardebil. He was a student and a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Also, Mr. Feizi is one of 1000 people
    identified in a UN Human Rights Commission's Special Representative's
    Report, "Names and particulars of persons allegedly executed by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran during the period July-December 1988," published
    January 26, 1989. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Shahriar Feizi was
    arrested on July 23, 1981. According to the MKO website, he was tortured
    so severely that both of his hands and both his legs were permanently
    disabled. Trial There is no information about this trial, just as there is
    no specific information about any such trials that condemned thousands of
    political prisoners to death in a few months period. According to the
    available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of
    the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense
    lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee, composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No
    charge has ever been publicly levelled against the defendant. In their
    letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the accusations against the prisoners that may have led to their
    execution. These include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of his
    designated successor Ayatollah Montazeri corroborates the reported claims
    regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict,
    Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMIO's members as "hypocrites" who do not
    believe in Islam and "who wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners
    who still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also
    "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence provided against
    the defendant. Defense No information is available about the his defense.
    In their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants
    were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating
    near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives
    from the outside during their detention: "Our children lived under most
    difficult conditions. Our visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass
    divider through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed over seven years
    that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed them to
    establish contacts outside their prison walls." Under such conditions the
    families reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were
    able to engage with the political groups outside Iran. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the defendant’s execution. Mr.
    Shahriar Feizi was hanged during the mass killings of the political
    prisoners at Evin Prison in August 1988.
