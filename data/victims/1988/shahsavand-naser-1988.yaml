    The information about Mr. Naser Shahsavand is taken from the book The
    Martyrs of the Tudeh Party by the Tudeh Party of Iran Publications.
    Additional information has been drawn from an electronic form sent to Omid
    by an individual familiar with this case. Mr. Shahsavand was an Air Force
    officer (specialized in radars and air control traffic tower) and a member
    of the Tudeh Party. Mr. Naser Shahsavand is one of the victims in the mass
    killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In
    addition to members of those Marxist-Leninist organizations oppose to the
    Islamic Republic, activists of organizations that were not against the
    Islamic Republic were also among the victims of these mass killings. The
    Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported the former Soviet Union's policies. The
    Party played a major role in Iran's political scene until it was banned
    for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the
    new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The exact
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Mr.
    Shahsavand was arrested on the way to his work (Mehrabad Airport in
    Tehran) in May/June 1983. He was detained at the Joint Committee and Evin
    prison. His first visitation with his family took place some 8 months
    after arrest in Evin (electronic form). Trial Mr. Shahsavand was first
    tried at a Martial Court, along with 7 other individuals, on January 16,
    1984 in the presence of an audience and a few photographers. The Court
    condemned Mr. Shahsavand to 12 years imprisonment (electronic form).
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Shahsavand and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are
    not known. According to the available information, the Iranian authorities
    did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the
    presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had
    been questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of a
    religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the
    Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about
    their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges According to the form, Mr. Shahsavand at his
    first trial was charged with acting against national security. No charge
    was publicly levelled against the defendant. In their letters to the
    Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced
    in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor,
    corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against the
    executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's
    members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against
    God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken
    by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. It is possible that the prisoners who were members of
    other organizations were charged for being "anti-religious" and were
    condemned for insisting on their beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution contain no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    Based on the information of the electronic form, at his first trial, Mr.
    Shahsavand was denied an attorney and did not have access to his own file.
    No information is available on his defense at the second trial. In their
    open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not
    given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion
    that prisoners were associated w
