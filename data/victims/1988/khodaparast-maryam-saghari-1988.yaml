    Information about Ms. Maryam Saghari Khodaparast has been taken from an
    electronic form that a former cellmate has sent to Omid. Ms. Saghari
    Khodaparast is also among 3208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO, also known as PMIO) whose execution was reported
    by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    Additionally, she is one of 1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission’s Special Representative’s Report, “Names and particulars of
    persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the
    period July-December 1988,” published January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, “in all probability”
    there were several thousand victims. “Most of the alleged victims were
    members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People’s
    Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims.” Information about the
    mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the
    memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations,
    interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Arrest and
    detention Ms. Saghari Khodaparast was arrested in the early 1980’s and
    detained in solitary confinement cells of Section 209n of Evin prison for
    several years. The details of her arrest and detention are not known. From
    1987 until her execution in July 1988, she was in Hall 3 of Ward 3 of the
    “sanatorium” in Evin prison (cells where the conditions were particularly
    difficult in order to “punish” the prisoners). Trial Ms. Saghari
    Khodaparast was tried and condemned to life imprisonment. Specific details
    on the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Ms.
    Saghari Khodaparast and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not
    known. According to existing information, there was no official trial with
    the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in
    1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about
    their beliefs and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of
    the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against
    the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms. Saghari
    Khodaparast’s defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves
    in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners
    (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed members of the
    Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic
    Republic, states that such claims “are false considering the circumstances
    in prisons; for our children faced most difficult conditions [in prison,
    with] visitation rights of once every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten
    minutes through a telephone from behind the glass window, and were
    deprived of any connection with the outside world. We faced such
    conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of our claim.” Judgment
    The details regarding the execution sentence are not available. In late
    July 1988, Ms. Maryam Saghari Khodaparast was called from
