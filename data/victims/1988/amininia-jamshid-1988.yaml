    Mr. Jamshid Amininia, son of Heydar and born in Tehran, is among 3208
    members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization whose
    execution was reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity . This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims
    families, and witnesses memoirs. A person familiar with this case has sent
    additional information about Mr. Amininia to Omid via an electronic form.
    Arrest and detention There is no specific information on the defendant s
    arrest and detention. According to the electronic form, Mr. Amininia was
    detained and interrogated in Evin prison. Trial Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Amininia and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with the presence of an
    attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against
    the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities
    accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as hypocrites who do not
    believe in Islam and wage war against God and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also waging
    war against God and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the
    families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the
    accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated
    with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed
    forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims are false
    considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most
    difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15
    days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind
    the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the outside
    world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of
    our claim. Judgment The details regarding the execution sentence are not
    available. Mr. Amininia was executed on July 27, 1988 in Evin prison.
    Months after the executions, prison authorities informed the families
    about the executions and handed in the victims belongings to their
    families. The bodies, however, were not returned to them. The bodies were
    buried in mass graves. Authorities warned the families of prisoners
    against holding memorial ceremonies.
