    Information about Ms. Nafiseh Rohani was gathered from an electronic form
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a relative. Her last name is also
    listed among victims of the massacre in 1988, published by Asre-nou and
    the Committee to Defend Human Rights in Iran located in Sweden. Ms.
    Nafiseh Rohani was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The
    Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information regarding the
    1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families,
    as well as Bidaran website. * The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary, and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a
    split within the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January
    of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along
    with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to
    recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution
    and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. ** Arrest and Detention No
    specific information is available concerning Ms. Nafiseh Rohani's arrest
    and detention. Trial No information is available on Ms. Nafiseh Rohani s
    trial. According to the testimonies of some of the political prisoners who
    were tried during the executions of the summer of 1988 in Gohardasht and
    Evin prisons. The trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the
    prison after a few weeks of isolation, during which prisoners were
    deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time.
    In August and September, a three-member delegation composed of
    Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious
    judge; and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, representative of the Ministry of
    Information - asked prisoners questions about their views on the
    Mojahedin, whether they would renounce their beliefs, and if they were
    ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were,
    the prisoners would have been charged with counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion and anti-Islam, or, associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders, and would be sentenced
    to death. The authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s
    purpose and the serious implications of their responses. During the summer
    of 1988, according to survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing
    with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their
    beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to the then-Minister of
    Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding
    these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an
    overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to
    prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed when
    they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their
    letters to the Minister of Justice (1988) and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have
    led to their executions. These accusations include being
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being,
    associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah K
