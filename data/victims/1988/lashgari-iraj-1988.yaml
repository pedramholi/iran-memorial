    Mr. Iraj Lashgari, son of Reza, was a victim of the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. The information about Mr. Lashgari has
    been drawn from an electronic form that a relative has sent to Omid. Mr.
    Lashgari, born in Kerman in 1955, was a law student in Tehran University
    and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Lashgari was arrested on June 23, 1981, at 1 a.m. in his
    father’s house in Kerman, and transferred to Evin prison (Tehran City).
    His family was unaware of his whereabouts for four months, after which
    they could visit him in prison. Visits generally took place from behind a
    glass divider, through telephone and in the presence of prison guards.
    During the 7 years of detention, Mr. Lashgari had two in-person visits
    with his family members. Trial Mr. Lashgari was tried in Tehran in the
    winter of 1982 and was condemned to 8 years imprisonment. Specific details
    on the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr.
    Lashgari and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known.
    According to existing information, there was no official trial with the
    presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988
    were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about
    their beliefs and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of
    the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against
    the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Lashgari’s defense.
    In their open letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants
    were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same
    letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the
    prison) had collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization
    in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such
    claims “are false considering the circumstances in prisons; for our
    children faced most difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation
    rights of once every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through
    a telephone from behind the glass window, and were deprived of any
    connection with the outside world. We faced such conditions for seven
    years, which proves the truth of our claim.” Judgment The details
    regarding the execution sentence are not available. Mr. Iraj Lashgari was
    executed some time between July – September 1988.
