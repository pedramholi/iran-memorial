    Mr. Hamid Heydari is one victim of the 1988-89 mass execution of political
    prisoners in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Many of the executed prisoners
    were members or sympathizers of the People s Mojahedin Organization of
    Iran (PMOI, also known as MKO). However, members or supporters of Marxist
    Leninist organizations, such as the People s Fadaiyan of Iran (Minority)
    or Peykar, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party
    and Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not oppose the regime, were among
    the victims. Complementary information has been gathered from the memoirs
    of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews
    with family members, and memoirs of witnesses, all provided to the
    Boroumand Foundation. He was also one of the 430 Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation
    of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a social
    imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and Detention There
    is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Almasi and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not
    known. According to available information, the Iranian authorities did not
    try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with the presence of
    defense lawyers. The prisoners executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly stated against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their
    letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being
    associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the MKO as hypocrites who do not believe in Islam and
    wage war against God and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the
    positions taken by this organization are also waging war against God and
    should be sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the MKO,
    may have been accused of being anti-religion for not having renounced his
    or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Almasi s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting
    the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had
    collaborated with armed members of the MKO in clashes with armed forces of
    the Islamic Republic, states that such claims are false considering the
    circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most difficult conditions
    [in the prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15 days, each
    visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind a glass
    window, and were deprived of any
