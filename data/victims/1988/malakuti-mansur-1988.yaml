    Mr. Mansur Malakuti is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and particulars of
    persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the
    period July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all probability"
    there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were
    members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's
    Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mullahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims." Mr. Mansur Malakuti is
    listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the People's Mojahedin of
    Iran Organization (PMIO) whose executions were reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity. This book
    documents the 1988-1989 mass execution of political prisoners. Additional
    information was drawn from the Bidaran website. Additional information was
    sent via an electronic form by a person informed about this case.
    According to this information, Mr. Mansur Malakuti was born in Gazbarkhar
    in Esfahan province. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention According to the electronic form, Mr.
    Mansur Malakuti was arrested based on information provided by his cousin
    who was a Revolutionary Guard. When agents could not find him in his
    house, the same cousin insisted that he was still at the house. Finally,
    during the second search of his house, Mr. Mansur Malakuti was arrested
    while attempting to escape from his residence in Gazbarkhar city in
    Esfahan province. Trial Specific details on the circumstances of the
    trials that led to the execution of Mr. Mansur Malakuti and thousands of
    other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to available
    information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of the 1988
    mass execution in a court with the presence of a defense lawyer. The
    prisoners executed in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member special
    committee composed of a religious judge, a representative of the
    Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned
    the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and their faith in God and
    religion. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly stated against the
    victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of
    Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in
    February 2003, the families of the victims refer to the authorities
    accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An
