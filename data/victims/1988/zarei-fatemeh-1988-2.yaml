    Information regarding Ms. Fatemeh Zare i s case was drawn from the
    following: the memoir of her father, Mr. Aziz Zare i ( Cahier d Aziz ,
    Gallimard, 2011); an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation (ABF) with her husband, Mr. Hasan Makaremi (2 April 2009); ABF
    correspondence with her daughter (16 May 2012); Jomhuri Eslami Newspaper
    (1 July 1981) and the Hambastegi Melli Website (2 August 2010). Additional
    information was collected from an interview by ABF with an eye-witness
    imprisoned with Ms. Zare i and Adel Abad: Everlasting Agony by Mr.
    Jahangir Esma ilpur. Ms. Zare i is one of the victims of the 1988 killings
    of political prisoners in Iran. The majority of these executed prisoners
    were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Other victims
    included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations
    including the Fadaiyan Khalq [Minority] and the Peykar Organization, which
    opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan
    Khalq [Majority], which did not. Ms. Zare i was born in 1953 in Abadeh, a
    small town in Fars Province in the central part of Iran. She was a physics
    teacher at the former Reza Shah High School in Shiraz, the capital of Fars
    Province. She was married in 1974. At the time of her arrest, she had two
    children, one of whom was 4 and the other a couple of months old (ABF
    interview, Hambastegi Melli Website). According to her husband, Ms. Zare i
    was politically active before the revolution in Tehran and used to attend
    the classes of Mr. Shari ati a modern religious figure whose ideas founded
    the basis of the Islamic Revolution. After the 1979 Revolution, she joined
    the Teachers Movement, which was affiliated with the MKO. The functions of
    this movement were distributing declarations and leaflets. Additionally,
    its meetings were concerned with these and other issues such as recruiting
    new members. Ms. Zare i s involvement included organizing demonstrations.
    In 1980 during the Cultural Revolution (1), she received a letter from her
    employer informing her that she was fired without the possibility of
    compensation because of what was determined, non-compliance with the
    principals of the Islamic Republic (ABF Interview). According to her
    husband, Ms. Zare i did not believe in armed struggle; taking arms
    required a disposition she did not have. In 1981, she announced her
    candidacy for the first Majles (Parliament) elections, representing the
    MKO. Her husband explained that because she was well-known for to her
    political activities in Shiraz, it caused numerous problems for her and
    her family. For example, a group of unknown individuals once broke the
    windows of their house. Ms. Zare i decided her safety was in jeopardy.
    Three months prior to her arrest, Fatemeh Zare i had not been sleeping at
    her house fearing the authorities could take her any day. Her family
    suggested leaving Shiraz, but she did not accept (ABF Interview). Her
    cellmates remembered her as a very strong woman who used to console other
    prisoners (ABF interview). Ms. Zare i s father remembers her as a good and
    wise person to seek advice. She always meant well. To her family, she was
    a problem solver and held the family together ( Cahier d Aziz ). It is
    noteworthy that Ms. Zare i s sister, Ms. Fattaneh Zare i was executed in
    1982 because of her cooperation in the MKO. Fattaneh was pregnant at the
    time of her execution. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary,
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They
    accepted Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis
    of Iranian society but at the same time, considered Islam as their source
    of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened
    when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following
    a deep ideological crisis the organization refuted Islam as its ideology
    and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members
    purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led
    to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruited
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and presence in governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, by either appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Isla
