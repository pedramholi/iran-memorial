    Mr. Mohammad Ali Behkish is one of the victims in the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. In addition to members of
    those Marxist-Leninist organizations oppose to the Islamic Republic such
    as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, activists of
    organizations such as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority)
    that were not against the Islamic Republic, were also among the victims of
    this mass killings. Information about Mr. Mohammad Ali Behkish is based on
    an interview conducted on June 10, 2005, with a person close to him. He
    was a high school student and a sympathizer of the Fadayian Khalq
    Organization (Minority). He worked in a construction company, but in 1981,
    he was forced to leave to escape prosecution. His sister and three
    brothers, who were all sympathizers of the Fadayian Khalq Organization (3
    members of the Minority faction, and one the Majority Faction), were also
    killed. His brother Mohammad was killed in 1981, his sister Zahra died
    under torture in 1983, and his brothers Mohsen and Mahmud (Fadayian Khalq
    Majority) were executed in 1985 and 1988 respectively. The Fadayian Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The
    Fadayian Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was mainly active
    in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Behkish was arrested after his identity was disclosed by on the members of
    the Fadayian Organization, by the Revolutionary Guards of the Joint
    Committee (Evin section 3000) at a rendezvous on August 24, 1983. His
    detention places were the Evin (until February of 1984) and the Joint
    Committee prisons. According to the interviewee, during the first days
    after his arrest, the Revolutionary Guards took him to his house in order
    to arrest other members of his family. It was evident that he was tortured
    severely. His feet were bloody. Trial Mr. Behkish was tried and condemned
    to 8 years imprisonment. There is no information about the trial sessions
    or its location. Also, there is no specific information about the
    circumstances of such trials that condemned this defendant and thousands
    of other political prisoners to death in a few months period. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving at the time they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges According to the interviewee, the
    charge against Mr. Mohammad Ali Behkish, in his first trial, was announced
    as "membership of the Fadayian Khalq Organization (Minority)." No charge
    has been publicly levelled against the defendant. In their letters to the
    Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who
    do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defence
    No information is available about the defendant s defence. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrillas operating near the borders, the
    families submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside during
    their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits
    were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone
    every two weeks. We
