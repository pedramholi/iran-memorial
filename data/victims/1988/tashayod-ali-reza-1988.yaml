    The information about Mr. Ali Reza Tashayod has been drawn from two
    electronic forms, sent to Omid by a friend and another individuals
    familiar with this case. Additionally his name (spelled Ali Tasha’Youd) is
    among the names of 1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission’s Special Representative’s Report, “Names and particulars of
    persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the
    period July-December 1988,” published January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, “in all probability”
    there were several thousand victims. “Most of the alleged victims were
    members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People’s
    Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims.” Mr. Tashayod was among
    the first members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He was arrested in
    1971 and severely tortured. He was condemned to life imprisonment. In
    prison, he changed his political ideology and became a Marxist. He was
    among the last group of political prisoners who were freed in January
    1979. He then joined the Rah-e Kargar Organization. Before his arrest, he
    was active in the underground publishing of the Organization’s leaflets
    and pamphlets. His sister, Nilufar Tashayod was executed in 1981. Mr.
    Tashayod was very sociable and humble. He had a good heart, and loved by
    friends and acquaintances. In prison, he was well-respected due to his
    background of political activism and modesty. He was married and had a
    daughter. He studied electrical engineering in university. “Rah-e Kargar”
    or the “Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran” was established in the
    summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various
    leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in
    political action. They identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists,
    promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat.
    They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they
    opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini’s leadership. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Tashayod was arrested in August/September 1982 and taken
    to Committee 3000. This prison was later renamed Tohid, and is now a
    museum. During the interrogation period, Mr. Tashayod was denied the an
    attorney and held incommunicado. His co-defendants witnessed that he was
    severely tortured and his feet were flogged. Nevertheless, he did not
    disclose any information to his interrogators. Mr Tashayod was later
    transferred to Evin prison and kept in locked rooms of the “sanatorium.”
    The latter was a section used for “punishment” of the prison where
    political prisoners, who remained steadfast on their beliefs, despite the
    pressure and intimidation. The living conditions were particularly
    difficult in the “sanatorium;” for example the doors of the cell would be
    opened for only three times a day, each time for half an hour. Prisoner
    were to use the bathroom, shower, and wash their clothes and dishes during
    these intervals. Trial Mr. Tashayod was tried but no verdict was issued
    about his case. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that
    led to the execution of Mr. Tashayod and thousands of other individuals in
    1988 are not known. According to existing information, there was no
    official trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who
    were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges
