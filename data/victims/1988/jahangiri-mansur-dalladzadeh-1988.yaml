    The information about Mr. Mansur Dalladzadeh Jahangiri was sent to Omid,
    via an electronic form, by an individual familiar with this case.
    Information about the mass executions of 1988 has been gathered by the
    Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of
    human rights organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and
    witnesses’ memoirs. Mr. Dalladzadeh Jahangiri, born in Tehran in 1958, was
    a student at Aria Mehr University (today’s Sharif University). He was a
    victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority
    of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Arrest
    and detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest
    and detention, other than he was arrested in 1981. Trial Mr. Dalladzadeh
    Jahangiri was tried and condemned to life imprisonment. Specific details
    on the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr.
    Dalladzadeh Jahangiri and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not
    known. According to existing information, there was no official trial with
    the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in
    1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about
    their beliefs and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of
    the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against
    the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization
    named by the leader of the Islamic Republic, may have been accused of
    being “anti-religion” for not having renounced his or her beliefs.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Dalladzadeh Jahangiri’s defense. In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants
    were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same
    letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the
    prison) had collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization
    in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such
    claims “are false considering the circumstances in prisons; for our
    children faced most difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation
    rights of once every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through
    a telephone from behind the glass window, and were deprived of any
    connection with the outside world. We faced such conditions for seven
    years, which proves the truth of our claim.” Judgment The details
    regarding the execution sentence are not available. Mr. Mansur Dalladzadeh
    Jahangiri was hanged in 1981. Months after the executions, prison
    authorities informed the families about the executions and handed in the
    victims’ belongings to their families. The bodies, however, were not
    returned to them. The bodies were buried in mass graves. Authorities
    warned the families of prisoners against holding memorial ceremonies.
