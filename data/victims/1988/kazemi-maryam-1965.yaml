# --- DEATH ---
date_of_death: 1988-08-01

place_of_death: "Evin Prison, Tehran (or other detention facility)"
cause_of_death: "Execution by hanging"
circumstances: >
  During the 1988 prison massacres, political prisoners across Iran were
  brought before "Death Commissions" — three-member panels of judicial,
  prosecution, and intelligence officials. They were asked a series of
  questions: Do you believe in God? Do you pray? Do you renounce your
  political group? Those who refused to denounce their beliefs were
  sentenced to death, often within minutes. Executions were carried out
  by hanging, sometimes in groups. Bodies were buried in mass graves,
  and families were not informed of the deaths for weeks or months.

  This entry represents the thousands of unnamed victims of the 1988
  massacre — men and women, some as young as teenagers, who chose their
  beliefs over their lives.

  Death Commissions authorized by Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa. Key figures
  include Ebrahim Raisi (later president), Mostafa Pourmohammadi, and

# --- AFTERMATH ---
burial:
  location: "Khavaran Cemetery, Tehran (mass grave site)"
  date: null
  circumstances: >
    Victims were buried in mass graves, most notably at Khavaran Cemetery
    in Tehran, which became known as "Lanatabad" (the cursed land).
    Families were often not told where their loved ones were buried.
    The regime has repeatedly attempted to destroy the Khavaran site,
    bulldozing and paving over sections to erase evidence.
  grave_status: "Partially destroyed by authorities"
family_persecution: >
  Families were threatened with imprisonment if they spoke publicly
  about the executions. Many were told their relatives had been
  "transferred" and learned the truth only months or years later.
  Mothers who gathered at Khavaran were arrested and beaten.
legal_proceedings: >
  No domestic accountability. In July 2024, the UN Special Rapporteur
  classified the 1988 massacres as genocide. Amnesty International and
  Human Rights Watch have called it crimes against humanity.
  Ebrahim Raisi, a member of the Tehran Death Commission, went on to
  become President of Iran (2021–2024) without ever facing justice.
