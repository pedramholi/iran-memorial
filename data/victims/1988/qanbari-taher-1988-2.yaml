    was graduated from Lahijan Teacher Training college with an associate
    degree and was a teacher Mr. Taher Qanbari, son of Safar, was one of the
    victims in the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority
    of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO). In addition to members of Marxist-Leninist organizations opposed to
    the Islamic Republic such as the Fadayian Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, activists of other organizations such as the Tudeh Party and
    the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority) that were not against the Islamic Republic,
    were also among the victims of this mass killings. Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center has collected additional information regarding the 1988 massacre
    from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from the Human Rights
    organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families as well
    as Bidaran website. Mr. Qanbari was born in Dehshal village of Astaneh
    Ashrafieh in Lahijan in 1958. He was graduated from the Lahijan Teacher
    Training college with an associate degree and was a teacher. Mr. Qanbari
    started his political activities with Rah-e Kargar and was a supporter of
    this organization. Rah-e Kargar or the Revolutionary Workers Organization
    of Iran was established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was
    founded by individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea
    of armed struggle and believed in political action. They identified
    themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the
    leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist
    party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah
    Khomeini s leadership. Arrest and detention Mr. Qanbari was arrested after
    June 20, 1981 in Tehran. There is no information available on the details
    of his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Qanbari s trial took place in
    Tehran in which he was sentenced to 8 years of imprisonment. There is no
    further information available on the details of his trial. According to
    the testimonies of leftist political prisoners who were tried in
    Gohardasht Prison during the executions of the summer of 1988, the trials
    took place in a room on the ground floor of the prison after a few weeks
    of isolation during which prisoners were deprived of visitation,
    television and radio broadcasts, and outdoors time. Towards the end of
    August, a three-member delegation composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the
    prosecutor, Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge, and hojatoleslam
    Pourmohamadi, the representative of the Ministry of Information asked
    prisoners questions about whether they were Muslim or Marxist, whether
    they prayed, and if their parents were practicing Muslims. Based on the
    prisoners responses, the later were sentenced to be hanged or the flogged
    until they agreed to pray. The authorities never informed prisoners about
    the delegation s purpose and the serious implications of their responses.
    According to survivors, during the summer of 1988 a large number of
    prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed
    for not recanting their beliefs. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official
    secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They
    note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and
    sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already
    completed when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly leveled against Mr. Qanbari. Based on the testimonies of
    the prisoners who were in prisons in the summer of 1988, the questions of
    the three-member committee from the leftist prisoners were about their
    beliefs and they were accused of being anti-religion , insisting on their
    beliefs and not repenting. In their letters to the Minister of Justice in
    1988, and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against the
    prisoners accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An edict of the Leader
    of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as hypocrites who do not believe in Islam and wage war
    against God and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also waging war against God and should be
    sentenced to death.
