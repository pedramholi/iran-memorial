    The information about Mr. Alborz Pakbaz was gathered from an electronic
    form sent to Boroumand Foundation by a person who knew him. He is also one
    of 1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission s Special
    Representative s Report published on January 26, 1989. He was a victim of
    the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. Boroumand Foundation has
    collected additional information regarding the 1988 massacre from the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from the Human Rights
    organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families as well
    as Bidaran website. Mr. Alborz Pakbaz was born in a poor farmer family in
    Sisakht city of Kohgiluye va Boyeahmad province in 1961. He was a student.
    The majority of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of
    theSoviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic
    and was active mainly in the political arena and the labor movement.
    Arrest and detention No specific information is available on Mr. Pakbaz's
    arrest and detention. Trial Specific details about the circumstances of
    the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Pakbaz . According to the
    testimonies of leftist political prisoners who were tried in Iran s
    Prisons during the executions of the summer of 1988, the trials took place
    in a room in the prisons after a few weeks of isolation during which
    prisoners were deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts,
    and outdoors time. Towards the end of August, a three-member delegation
    composed of the prosecutor, a religious judge, and a representative of the
    Ministry of Information asked prisoners questions about whether they were
    Muslim or Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were
    practicing Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the later were
    sentenced to be hanged or the flogged until they agreed to pray. The
    authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and
    the serious implications of their responses. According to survivors,
    during the summer of 1988 a large number of prisoners sympathizing with
    the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their
    beliefs. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughoutIran. In their 1988 open letter to Minister of Justice at the
    time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly stated
    against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. Based on the testimonies
    of the prisoners who were in prisons in the summer of 1988, the questions
    of the three-member committee from the leftist prisoners were about their
    beliefs and they were accused of being anti-religion , insisting on their
    beliefs and not repenting. In their letters to the Minister of Justice in
    1988, and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against the
    prisoners accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An edict of the Leader
    of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as hypocrites who do not believe in Islam and wage war
    against God and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also waging war against God and should be
    sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, may have been accused of being anti-religion for not having
    renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is availab
