    Information about Mr. Hassan Nurbakhsh was gathered from an electronic
    form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with this case.
    Mr. Hassan Nurbakhsh is also cited in the list, Yadnameh, published by the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, Majority Branch (April 2002: Koln). He was a
    victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from the human
    rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families,
    as well as from the Bidaran website. The majority of the executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims
    included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such
    as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which
    opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan
    Khalq (Majority), which did not. Mr. Nurbakhsh was born in Azarbaijan in
    1957 and was a computer science student at the National University. He was
    married and had a son. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist-Leninist
    group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements
    of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to
    the Pahlavi regime. After the 1979 Revolution, the organization, which
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority supported and
    considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist
    regime. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted
    its members solely because of their political beliefs. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Nurbakhsh was arrested on a street in Tehran in August or
    September 1986. After his arrest, the state authorities visited his house
    and arrested his wife and their son. They were all taken to Tohid Prison
    (where torture and harsh interrogation were used then and which is a
    museum today). Trial Mr. Nurbakhsh was tried and condemned to
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Nurbakhsh and thousands of other individuals in
    1988 are not known. According to the testimonies of leftist political
    prisoners who were tried in Evin and Gohardasht prisons during the
    executions of the summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room on the
    ground floor of the prison after a few weeks of isolation, during which
    prisoners were deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts,
    and outdoor time. Toward the end of August, a three-member delegation
    composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri,
    the religious judge; and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of
    the Ministry of Information, asked prisoners questions about whether they
    were Muslim or Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were
    practicing Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the latter were
    sentenced to be hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The
    authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose, and
    the serious implications of their responses. According to survivors,
    during the summer of 1988, a large number of prisoners sympathizing with
    the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their
    beliefs. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to the Minister of Justice at
    the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding
    these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an
    overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to
    prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed when
    they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly stated against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. Based on
    the testimonies of those who were in prisons in the summer of 1988, the
    questions of the three-member committee from the leftist prisoners were
    about their beliefs and they were accused of being anti-religion,
    insisting on their beliefs and not repenting. In their letters to the
    Minister of Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting
    Iran in February 2003, the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being,
    associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members
