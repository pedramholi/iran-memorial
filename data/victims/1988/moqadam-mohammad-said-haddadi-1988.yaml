    Mr. Mohammad Sa id Haddadi Moqadam is one victim of the 1988-89 mass
    execution of political prisoners in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The
    majority of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims families, and witnesses memoirs.
    Mr. Haddadi Moqadam was born in Ramsar (Mazandaran province) in 1956. He
    was an economics student in Paris and had two children. He was a
    sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Minority). The Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban
    Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded
    in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following
    the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle,
    split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union.
    The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active
    mainly in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention
    According to one of his relatives, Mr. Haddadi Moqadam was arrested by the
    plain clothes agents at a relative s house in April of 1985. His cousin,
    who attempted to escape, was shot and arrested with him. His family had no
    information about his detention location for two months, but he was
    detained at Evin prison. He had his first visitation with his parents
    after two months and every 15 days thereafter. According to this source,
    Mr. Haddadi Moqadam was tortured in prison. Trial Mr. Haddadi Moqadam was
    tried in early 1986. He was first condemned to death and then to life
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Haddadi Moqadam and thousands of other individuals
    in 1988 are not known. According to available information, the Iranian
    authorities did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court
    with the presence of a defence lawyer. The prisoners executed in 1988 had
    been questioned by a three-member special committee composed of a
    religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the
    Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about
    their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed at the time they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of
    the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against
    the prisoners accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An edict of the Leader
    of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as hypocrites who do not believe in Islam and wage war
    against God and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also waging war against God and should be
    sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization
    named by the leader of the Islamic Republic, may have been accused of
    being anti-religion for not having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence
    of guilt The report of this execution does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on his defense. In their open letter, the
    families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the
    accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated
    with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed
    forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims are false consi
