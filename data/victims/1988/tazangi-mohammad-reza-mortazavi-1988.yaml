    Information about Mr. Mohammad Reza Mortazavi Tazangi was gathered from an
    electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with
    this case and the website of the Documents Archives of Iranian Opposition.
    Mr. Mortazavi Tazangi is also listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were reported by the
    organization in a book titled Crime Against Humanity . He is also one of
    1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission Special
    Representative s Report published on January 26, 1989. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families,
    as well as from the Bidaran website. * Mr. Mohammad Reza Mortazavi Tazangi
    was born in Tehran. He was a high school graduate and a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. According to the electronic form, he was
    first arrested in 1981 and was detained at the Adelabad Prison in Shiraz
    until 1983. After he was released from the prison, he joined the
    resistance cells of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and set fire to the
    vehicle of an official during an operation. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to a split within the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in
    1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were
    released along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize
    the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic s leaders. ** Arrest and Detention
    According to the electronic form [mentioned above], Mr. Mohammad Reza
    Mortazavi Tazangi was arrested for the second time in 1985. He was
    transferred to the Revolutionary Guards detention center and the Andarzgah
    Section at Adelabad Prison in Shiraz, where he was tortured severely. No
    specific information is available on his arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Mohammad Reza Mortazavi Tazangi s trial.
    According to the testimonies of some of the political prisoners who were
    tried during the executions of the summer of 1988, in some of the prisons,
    the trials took place in a room in the prison, after a few weeks of
    isolation, during which prisoners were deprived of visitation, television
    and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and September, a
    three-member delegation composed of the public prosecutor, a religious
    judge, and a representative of the Ministry of Information asked prisoners
    questions about their views regarding the Mojahedin, whether they would
    renounce their beliefs, and if they were ready to cooperate against the
    Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the prisoners would have been
    charged with counter revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam as well
    as being associated with military action or with various [opposition]
    groups based near the borders and would be sentenced to death. The
    authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and
    the serious implications of their responses. During the summer of 1988,
    according to survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing with the
    Mojahedin or leftist groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs.
    Relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to the Minister of Justice at the time,
    Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had a
