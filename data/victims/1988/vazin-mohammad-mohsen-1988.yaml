    Information about Mr. Mohammad-Mohsen Vazin was gathered from two
    electronic forms sent to the Boroumand Foundation by persons familiar with
    this case. Further information was gathered from a list of 1988 executions
    published on the Asre-nou website. Mr. Mohammad-Mohsen Vazin is also
    listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, whose executions were reported by the organization in a book
    entitled Crime Against Humanity . He is also one of 1,000 people
    identified in a UN Human Rights Commission s Special Representative s
    Report, published on January 26, 1989. The Boroumand Foundation has
    collected additional information regarding the 1988 massacre from the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri; reports from human rights organizations;
    interviews with the witnesses and victims families; as well as from the
    Bidaran website. * According to the existing information, Mr.
    Mohammad-Mohsen Vazin was born in Tehran in 1957. He was married, had a
    daughter, and resided in Tehran. He graduated from university as a math
    major. According to one of the correspondents, who had been his cellmate
    in Qezelhesar Prison during 1984 and 1985, Mr. Vazin was a member of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary, and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members, based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic s leaders. ** Arrest and Detention No specific
    information is available on Mr. Mohammad-Mohsen Vazin's arrest and
    detention. According to electronic forms, he was detained at Qezelhesar
    and Evin prisons. His last visitation with his family took place in August
    of 1988 before the massacre. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Mohammad-Mohsen Vazin s trial. According to the testimonies of some of the
    political prisoners, who were tried during the executions of the summer of
    1988 in Gohardasht and Evin prisons. The trials took place in a room on
    the ground floor of the prison after a few weeks of isolation, during
    which prisoners were deprived of visitation, television and radio
    broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and September, a three-member
    delegation, composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam
    Nayyeri, the religious judge; and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the
    representative of the Ministry of Information. They asked prisoners
    questions about their views on Mojahedin, whether they would renounce
    their beliefs, and if they were ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin.
    Based on what the answers were, the prisoners would have been charged with
    counter revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, or associated with
    military action, or with various [opposition] groups based near the
    borders, and [they] would be sentenced to death. The authorities never
    informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious
    implications of their responses. According to survivors, during the summer
    of 1988, a large number of prisoners, sympathizing with the Mojahedin or
    Leftist groups, were executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives
    of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the
    judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran.
    In their 1988 open letter to then-Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they
    argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of
    their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Char
