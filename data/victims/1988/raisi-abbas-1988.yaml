    Mr. Abbas Ra isi is one of the victims of the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The majority of the
    executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other
    victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Information about
    the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the
    memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations,
    interviews with victims families, and witnesses memoirs. Information
    regarding Mr. Ra isi s execution was provided to Omid via an electronic
    form and an interview conducted on May 14, 2006 with one of his relatives,
    and the prison memoirs entitled What Happened to Us in 1988 by Nima
    Parvaresh, copyright 1994, Paris, published by the Committee to Organize
    the Memorial of the Massacre of Political Prisoners. Mr. Ra isi, born in
    Borazjan (Bushehr province), was a member of the Peykar Organization. He
    was a law student at Tehran s National University. He was sentenced to 3
    to 4 years in prison. At the end of his prison terms, authorities did not
    release him because he refused to give a television confession, during
    which he would recant his political faith. His brother, an MKO member, was
    also executed him in Borazjan. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation
    of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third Line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social
    imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention There
    is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Mr. Ra
    isi was arrested in the afternoon in October 1981, in Tehran. He was
    detained at Qezelhesar, Evin and Gohardasht prisons. He was allowed
    visitation with his mother and brother 4-5 months after his arrest and
    received the packages that they brought for him. He was also allowed to
    send one card each New Year and letters, which were 7 lines long. During
    the visitations, Mr. Ra isi told his family that he would not be released
    unless he agreed to give a televised confession and read a statement
    recanting his political beliefs. For his refusal of these demands, Mr. Ra
    isi was relocated to the melli kesh section of the prison (a section for
    political prisoners who refused such confessions) and denied the right to
    further communicate with his family via letters. He was detained for 6
    years before being executed. Trial According to the form, Mr. Ra isi was
    tried for a second time in late August or early September 1988. He was
    reportedly asked about his religious beliefs and had declared that he was
    a Marxist and not a Muslim. Based on his cellmate s prison memoir, Mr. Ra
    isi and his cellmates had heard prior to his execution that whoever
    defends his ideology would be executed. They knew it because political
    prisoners in the section next to theirs were being tried and those who did
    not repent were executed. Mr. Ra isi and his cellmates had a debate about
    the appropriate response if they were to be questioned about their
    political beliefs and he decided that he had to defend his ideology. He
    argued that: my ideology is my identity. If I deny it, I deny myself. If I
    repent, I would be ashamed to return to my hometown where my brother was
    killed. According to existing information, there was no official trial
    with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed
    in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious
    judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public
    Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some
    questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in God. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving when th
