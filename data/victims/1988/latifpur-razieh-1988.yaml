    The information about Ms. Razieh Latifpur, daughter of Mohammad, was
    gathered from an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a
    person familiar with this case. She is also one of 1,000 people identified
    in a UN Human Rights Commission s Special Representative s Report
    published on January 26, 1989. The Boroumand Foundation has collected
    additional information regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from the Human Rights organizations,
    interviews with the witnesses and victims families as well as from the
    Bidaran website. * According to the information sent to the Boroumand
    Foundation, Ms. Razieh Latifpur was born in Abadeh in 1959. She was
    single, a geography student at Tehran University, and a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. After the universities were shut down during
    the Cultural Revolution, she went underground. Her family was a part of
    the Qashqa i tribe and her brother was killed during the Iran Iraq war in
    1983. She was a kind and honest person who loved to read books. The
    Cultural Revolution Background The Cultural Revolution began after
    Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech in March 1980 and ordered that
    universities be purged of all those who opposed his government and be
    transformed into learning environments (as opposed to political forums)
    where an all-Islamic curriculum would be taught. The first wave of
    violence began on April 15,1980 during a speech by Akbar Hashemi
    Rafsanjani, a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister
    of Interior, at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech, students
    supporting the government took control of the University s central
    building and demanded that the university be purged from pro-Shah elements
    and other sellouts. On April 18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution
    issued a communiqu accusing political groups of converting higher
    education institutions into headquarters of discordant political
    activities and naming them as obstacles to the radical transformation of
    the universities. The communiqu gave these groups three days, Saturday
    April 19 to Monday April 21, to shut down their activities in the
    universities. The Council stressed that the decision included libraries
    along with activities related to arts and sports. Political groups, which
    had recruited members and had strong support in the universities, refused
    to evacuate. Before the Council s deadline, serious clashes took place
    between leftist groups and Islamist Associations, the latter at times
    supported by security forces and paramilitary groups. These clashes, which
    peaked at the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in the deaths of
    several people and the wounding of hundreds of others on university
    campuses around the country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic authorities
    announced the victory of the Cultural Revolution and the closure of all
    universities in order to Islamicize the curricula. The universities
    remained closed for two years. One of the outcomes of the Cultural
    Revolution was the purging of many university professors and students
    based on their political beliefs. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as
    its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam
    was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    government. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. ** Arrest and Detention According to the
    information sent to the Boroumand Foundation, Ms. Razieh Latifpur was
    arrested on a city bus on a summer s day in 1983. She was on her way home
    when identified by an ex-coworker who worked with the government. She was
    transferred to the Evin prison.
