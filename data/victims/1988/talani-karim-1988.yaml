    Mr. Karim Talani’s name, an affiliate of the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kordestan, is taken from the book Those Who Said No , published in 1999 in
    Paris by the Association for the Defense of Political Prisoners and
    Prisoners of Conscience in Iran. He was a victim of the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports by human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. The Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kordestan (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with the objective to gain autonomy
    for Kurdistan, in north-west of Iran. After the Revolution, conflicts
    between the new central Shiite government and the mainly Sunni Kurdistan,
    regarding the role of minorities in the drafting of the constitution,
    specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and particularly
    the autonomy of the region, ended in armed clashes between the
    Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The PDKI
    boycotted the referendum of April 1, when people went to polls to vote for
    or against the Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979 Ayatollah Khomeini
    called the PDKI the “party of Satan” and declared it “unofficial and
    illegal.” Mass executions and fighting broke out and continued for several
    months in the region. By 1983, PDKI had lost much of its influence in the
    region. Various leaders of the PDKI have been assassinated. Arrest and
    detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and
    detention. Trial Specific details about the circumstances of the trials
    that led to the execution of Mr. Talani and thousands of other individuals
    in 1988 are not known. According to existing information, there was no
    official trial with attorneys or prosecutors. Those who were executed in
    1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about
    their beliefs and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they
    argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of
    their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly stated against the
    victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of
    Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in
    February 2003, the families of the victims refer to the authorities’
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being “counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who do not
    believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also “waging
    war against God” and should be sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not
    belong to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, may have been accused of being
    “anti-religion” for not having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Talani’s defense. In their open letter, the families of
    the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that
    these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in clashes with armed forces
    of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are false considering
    the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced the most difficult
    conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once
