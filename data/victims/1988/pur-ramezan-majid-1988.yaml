    Information regarding the execution of Mr. Majid Pur-Ramezan is taken from
    Bidaran Website, Hambastegi Melli Website, and the prison memoires of Mr.
    Hossein Farsi and Mr. Iraj Mesdaghi (Book 3). Mr. Pur-Ramezan s name is
    also published in Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) s book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity. This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. Mr. Pur-Ramezan was from Shiraz and was arrested and
    convicted due to his membership to a political group named Arman-e Mostaz
    afan . In prison, he got close to MKO s prisoners and became a supporter
    of their organization. (Prison memoires of Mr. Farsi and Mr. Mesdaghi)
    Arman-e Mostaza fin Organization was founded in the summer of 1976 before
    the Islamic Revolution. This organization, just like the MKO, were
    followers of Mohammad Ali Shariati s ideology, and started their
    ideological activities after the revolution by publishing a magazine
    called Arman or Payam-e Mostaz afin . There are a few members in this
    group and they were mainly active in Dezful (in Khuzestan Province). They
    were against armed struggle and their ideological activities lasted until
    February 1982 when their leaders and members were arrested. Although the
    leaders were not executed, some of the members were executed in different
    cities. Arrest and detention No detailed information is available on Mr.
    Pur-Ramezan s. He was first detained in Qezelhesar Prison. According to
    one of the MKO prisoners, Mr. Pur-Ramezan was in locked cells in 1983 and
    1984 and in cell number 13 of ward 3 of Gohardasht Prison for a while.
    They would call him Kal Haji in the prison. (Prison memoire of Mr. Farsi)
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Pur-Ramezan s trial. According to
    the testimonies of some of the political prisoners who were tried during
    the executions of the summer of 1988 in Gpohardasht and Evin prisons, the
    trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the prison after a few
    weeks of isolation during which prisoners were deprived of visitation,
    television and radio broadcasts, and outdoors time. In August and
    September, a three-member delegation composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the
    prosecutor, Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge, and Hojatoleslam
    Pourmohamadi, the representative of the Ministry of Information asked
    prisoners questions about their views on Mojahedin, whether they would
    renounce their beliefs and if they were ready to cooperate against the
    Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the prisoners would have been
    charged with counter revolutionary, anti-religion and anti-Islam or
    associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders and would be sentenced to death. The authorities never
    informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious
    implications of their responses. According to survivors, during the summer
    of 1988 a large number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or
    Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then-Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed when they were retried and sentenced to death.
    Charges Mr. Pur-Ramezan was charged with Supporting the Arman-e Mostaz
    afan Organization and he was sentenced to imprisonment for the same
    reason. However, when in 1988 prisoners were questioned about their
    beliefs and their political party s affiliation, he had introduced himself
    as an MKO supporter. (Prison Memoires of Mr. Farsi, and Mr. Mesdaghi) In
    their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988) and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being
    associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as hypocrites who do
    not believe in Islam and wage war against God and decrees that prisoners
    who still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also
    waging war against God and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt
    No information is available regarding the evidence presented against Mr.
    Pur-Ramezan. Defense According to
