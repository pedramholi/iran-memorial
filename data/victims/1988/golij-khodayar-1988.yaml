    Mr. Khodayar Golij, son of Aqagol and born in Tonkabon (Mazandaran
    province) into a farmer’s family, is among 3208 members and sympathizers
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose execution was reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . Additional
    information about Mr. Golij has been sent to Omid via an electronic form
    by a person familiar with this case. This book documents the 1988-89 mass
    executions of political prisoners. Information about the mass executions
    has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Arrest and detention There is no
    specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Golij and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not
    known. According to existing information, there was no official trial with
    the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in
    1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    According to the available information, Mr. Golij was denied the right to
    be represented by an attorney. In their open letter, the families of the
    victims of 1988 mass executions noted that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the
    accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated
    with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed
    forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are false
    considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most
    difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15
    days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind
    the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the outside
    world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of
    our claim.” Judgment The details regarding the execution sentence are not
    available. Mr. Khodayar Golij was hanged at Gohardasht prison in August of
    1988. Months after the executions, prison authorities informed the
    families about the executions and handed in the victims’ belongings to
    their families. The bodies, however, were not returned to them. The bodies
    were buried in mass graves. Authorities warned the families of prisoners
    against holding memorial ceremonies.
