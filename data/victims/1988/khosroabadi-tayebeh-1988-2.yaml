    Ms. Tayebeh Khosroabadi is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission’s Special Representative’s Report, “Names and
    Particulars of Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    in 1988 during the period of July through December,” published on January
    26, 1989. Ms. Tayebeh Khosroabadi is also listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the People’s Mojahedin of Iran Organization whose
    execution was reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity . Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran
    website, the Mojahedin website, and an Electronic Form which was sent to
    the Boroumand Foundation by one of Ms. Khosroabadi’s cellmates. Ms.
    Khosroabadi was born in 1963 in Sabzevar (Khorasan province) and a high
    school graduate. She was born with a paralyzed leg and walked with
    difficulty. According to her cellmate, at the time of her arrest she was a
    new bride. She wanted to learn English and before her execution she did
    her best to learn the language. According to the Mojahedin website, she
    had an active role in organizing strikes in prison. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Ms. Tayebeh Khosroabadi was arrested between March 1982 and March 1983.
    According to her cellmate, who came to know Ms. Khosroabadi in detention,
    she had backache due to her disability. She had so much pain that another
    cellmate who was a specialist in physiotherapy (who was executed in 1988)
    massaged her back to ease the pain. Trial Initially Ms. Tayebeh
    Khosroabadi was tried and condemned to 6 years imprisonment. There is no
    specific information about trials that condemned this defendant and
    thousands of political prisoners to death in the span of a few months.
    According to the available information, the Iranian authorities did not
    try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence
    of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been
    questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of a religious
    judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran
    Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their
    beliefs, faith in God, and their religion. According to her cellmate, her
    imprisonment would have ended in the summer 1988. Ms. Khosroabadi was in
    the last group of prisoners who were taken from the upper level of the
    women’s ward to the corridor of Section 209 of Evin Prison to face the
    Special Committee. At the time, due to over-crowdedness, the Special
    Committee did not have sufficient time to prosecute this group and they
    were taken back to their cell. They were the only prisoners (among the
    victims of the August 1988 executions) who were returned to their cell.
    They did not suspect that they would be re-tried even though they had
    noted the prison’s extraordinary circumstances having waited in the
    corridor of Section 209. The relatives of political prisoners executed in
    1988 refuted the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argued that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions was a proof of their illegality. They noted
    that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and
    sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already
    completed serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death.
    Charges No charge has ever been publicly leveled against the defendant or
    other victims of the 1988 mass execution. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the accusations
    against the prisoners that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict from the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the Mojahedin’s members as
    “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and who “wage war against God”
    and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by
    this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available about her defense. In their open letter, the
    families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that the
    prisoners (from inside the prison) collaborated with guerrilla forces
    operating near the borders, the families sub
