    Mr. Rahmat Fathi, son of Rahmatollah, was a victim of the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not oppose the Islamic Republic. Information about
    the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the
    memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations,
    interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs. The information
    about Mr. Fathi is based on an interview with his wife, Maryam Nuri. Ms.
    Nuri, who spent many years in prison, mentions Mr. Fathi in her book of
    memoirs In Search of Freedom (2005). Mr. Fathi is also among the victims
    of the massacre listed in the book Those Who Said “No” , published in 1999
    by the Paris-based Association for the Defense of Political Prisoners and
    Prisoners of Conscience in Iran. Mr. Rahmat Fathi was born in Meshkin
    Shahr (in today’s Ardebil province) in 1960. He was a college-educated
    student. Mr. Fathi worked in a construction company. He was a member of
    the Fadaiyan Khalq Minority and in charge of the distribution of its
    publications. According to his wife, Mr. Fathi was very kind. He was
    compassionate and was loved by family and friends. In prison, if any
    cellmate had a conflict, he volunteered to mediate and resolve the issue.
    His wife remembers that he always wanted to be a father – and in fact he
    had a son, who was born in prison. He loved to hear his son call him dad.
    The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist-Leninist group, inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements in Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 Revolution, the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization – which
    renounced armed struggle – split over support of the Islamic Republic and
    of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic
    Republic and was mainly active in the political arena and the labor
    movement. Arrest and detention Mr. Rahmat Fathi was arrested outside his
    residence on November 4, 1985. He was detained at Ward 3000 for three
    months and was later transferred to Evin Prison. During the previous
    regime, Ward 3000 was known as the Joint Anti-Sabotage Committee, which
    was later renamed 3000 Ward and subsequently Tohid Prison. Before and
    after the revolution, political prisoners were tortured in this infamous
    prison, which today is the Ebrat Museum. While in detention, Mr. Fathi was
    only afforded one short visit at Ward 3000 and a few visits with his
    family members at Evin prison. He was allowed to see his wife – who was
    also a prisoner – only once. During this visit, he also saw his son.
    According to Ms. Nuri, he was tortured severely and was hospitalized in
    prison. He was flogged regularly because he refused to pray. Trial In
    1985, a court in Ward 3000 condemned Mr. Fathi to 10 years imprisonment.
    No other information is available on his trial. Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Fathi and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with the presence of an
    attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This
    committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs
    and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    officials’ secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No information is available on Mr. Fathi’s charges. No
    charge has been publicly ordered against the victims of the 1988 mass
    executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988, and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in February of 2003, the families
    of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners
    – accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as
    well as being “associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoi
