    The information about Mr. Ali Asghar Manuchehrabadi has been taken from an
    electronic form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case, as
    well as the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party
    Publications. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    of human rights organizations, interviews with victims families, and
    witnesses memoirs. Mr. Manuchehrabadi is one of the victims in the mass
    killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Other
    victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Mr.
    Manuchehrabadi, one of the seven children in his family, was a mechanical
    engineer and a graduate from Tehran Polytechnic University (today s Amir
    Kabir University). When he was a university student he started his
    political activities in the Navid (the underground organization of the
    Tudeh Party). He then started working as the technical manager at the
    Jahan Chit factory in Karaj and continued his political activities. He got
    married in 1979 and had two children. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created
    in 1941. Its ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of
    the former Soviet Union. The Tudeh Party played a major role in Iran s
    political scene until it was banned for the second time following the
    August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh Party declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party leaders and members were
    imprisoned. Arrest and detention According to the electronic form, Mr.
    Manuchehrabadi was arrested on May 1, 1983 around 10 p.m. The armed agents
    did not show him an arrest warrant. Although his newborn child needed
    help, they did not allow Mr. Manuchehrabadi to change the diapers. The
    agents searched the whole house, which was in chaos by the time they left,
    taking Mr. Manuchehrabadi with them. Mr. Manuchehrabadi was interrogated
    at the Joint Committee. His family was unaware of his whereabouts for four
    months. He was then allowed to make a one-monite phone call to his family,
    but they still did not know where Mr. Manuchehrabadi was detained. His
    first visited took place in March 1984, more than ten months after his
    arrest, in a school. Mr. Manuchehrabadi was blindfolded and taken to this
    unknown location. The visist lasted for ten minutes. His interrogation
    continued for two years (electronic form). After the initial visit, Mr.
    Manuchehrabadi was held incommunicado until the summer, when he was
    transferred to Evin prison. In Evin, he had visits every other week, but
    the visits were occasionally cancelled for various reasons. The prison
    authorities prevented Mr. Manuchehrabadi from writing letters to his
    family. Throughout his imprisonment, his family received only three
    postcards from him. According to the Tudeh Book, Mr. Manuchehrabadi was
    also kept in Qezelhesar prison; the dates and duration of his stay in this
    prison are not known. Mr. Manuchehrabadi was tortured on various
    occasions. His feet were flogged and he lost sight of his left eye. In the
    spring of 1988, the prison guards throw him down the stairs, causing four
    of his teeth to break, as they transferred him to Gohardasht prison. Trial
    Mr. Ali Asghar Manuchehrabadi was tried and condemned to three years
    imprisonment in a court at Evin Prison (Tudeh book). The religious judge
    and the interrogator were present in this trial. Mr. Manuchehrabadi was
    denied the right to have an attorney and access to his file (electronic
    form). Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Manuchehrabadi and thousands of other individuals in 1988
    are not known. According to existing information, there was no official
    trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were
    executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison
