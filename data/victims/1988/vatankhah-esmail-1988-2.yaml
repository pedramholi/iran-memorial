    Mr. Esma’il Vatankhah is one of the victims in the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. The information about Mr. Esma’il
    Vatankhah is taken from an electronic mail sent to Omid by a relative as
    well as the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party
    Publications. He was born in Tehran in 1953. He was a science student at
    the National University. In 1984, before the Rvolution, he was arrested
    during a student strike and condemned to two years imprisonment. In 1977,
    he joined the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941.
    The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of
    the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran’s political
    scene until it was banned for the second time following the August 19,
    1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah
    Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and therefore actively supported the new government.
    Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the
    target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party leaders and
    members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Esma’il Vatankhah was
    arrested along with his pregnant wife on April 27, 1983. Trial Mr. Esma’il
    Vatankhah was tried in November 1984and condemned to five years
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Vatankhah and thousands of other individuals in
    1988 are not known. According to existing information, there was no
    official trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who
    were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization named by the leader of
    the Islamic Republic, may have been accused of being “anti-religion” for
    not having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt At the time of
    arrest, the authorities confiscated the books in the house even as the
    books could be purchased from any bookstore. During detention, Mr.
    Vatankhah refused to repent his political beliefs (electronic mail).
    Defense No information is available about his defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting
    the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had
    collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes
