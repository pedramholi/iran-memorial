    is assumed to have been pregnant at the time of her arrest. Information
    about the execution of Mrs. Marzieh Mohammadhassani Khorasani, daughter of
    Sakineh Beigom and Mahmud, as well information about the execution of her
    husband * was obtained through Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interview
    with one of her relatives on May 2, 2018 (ABC interview). Mrs.
    Mohammadhassani Khorasani is among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) whose execution was reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime against Humanity. This book
    documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. Additional
    information was drawn from the Bidaran website. Mrs. Mohammadhassani
    Khorasani was born in 1963 in the Khorasani neighborhood of the city of
    Behbahan in Khuzestan Province. His father was a farmer and passed away
    six months after Mrs. Mohammadhassani Khorasani s birth. Mrs.
    Mohammadhassani Khorasani was a very religious person and taught Quran to
    the girls in her neighborhood. She was very kind, spirited, and
    big-hearted, and lived with her husband in Bushehr and Bandar Abbas, and
    during that time, she got to know the MKO and became a supporter and
    sympathizer of the organization. Mrs. Mohammadhassani Khorasani was a very
    religious person and taught Quran to the girls in her neighborhood. The
    MKO was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam
    as its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam
    was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. ** Arrest and detention Mrs.
    Mohammadhassani Khorasani was arrested and detained along with her husband
    in 1981 in the city of Bandar Abbas. The interviewee quoted a close
    relative of Mrs. Mohammadhassani Khorasani as saying that she was pregnant
    at the time of her arrest (ABC interview). No additional information about
    her arrest and detention is available. Sometime after her arrest, Mrs.
    Mohammadhassani Khorasani was transferred to Adelabad Prison in Shiraz and
    was held there for seven years. During her detention, she did not have
    access to a lawyer, but she was allowed to visit her family. At one of the
    visitations, Mrs. Mohammadhassani Khorasani s brother had heard from the
    prison guard that the judiciary had offered to release Mrs.
    Mohammadhassani Khorasani conditionally. During the last visit with her
    brother, Mrs. Mohammadhassani Khorasani explained that the judiciary had
    asked her to shoot a fellow MEK sympathizer at an execution. Her brother,
    presuming that writing a repentance letter or making a confession about
    alleged charges were among the conditions that would secure Mrs.
    Mohammadhassani Khorasani s release, had encouraged her to accept the
    proposed conditions. Mrs. Mohammadhassani Khorasani rejected his request,
    however, explaining that the judiciary had asked her to shoot a fellow MEK
    sympathizer at an execution. This was Mrs. Mohammadhassani Khorasani s
    last visit with her family (ABC interview). Trial No information is
    available on Mrs. Mohammadhassani Khorasani s trial. The circumstances
    that led to this defendant's execution are unknown. However, relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is the proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and sente
