    He studied in a tribal high school in Shiraz and then enrolled in the
    Police Force Officer s College. He was a free-spirited, kind, generous,
    sincere, and forthright person and tried to help everybody. Mr. Ya qub
    Behnia is one of the 3,208 members of the Mojahedeen Khalq Organization
    news of whose executions has been published by the Organization in a book
    entitled Crime Against Humanity* . This book is a report regarding mass
    execution of political prisoners in the years 1988 and 1989. Additional
    information about this case was obtained from a Boroumand Center interview
    with a person close to him, through two electronic forms filled out and
    sent to the Boroumand Center by individuals who knew him, as well as from
    the Bidaran website. Mr. Ya qub Behnia, child of Kheibar, was born on May
    24, 1953, and was single. He was the eldest child of a family of the
    Turkish Qashqai tribe and had two brothers and a sister. His parents were
    stockbreeders and tribespeople. Mr. Behnia s was a proud and reputable
    family. He studied at the tribal high school in Shiraz and then enrolled
    in the Police Force Officer s College. At the time of his arrest, Mr.
    Behnia was a police officer in the town of Fassa, and prior to that, he
    had worked at Tehran s Qasr Prison, Shiraz Adelabad Prison, and had also
    worked on the town of Darab s police force. According to a person who knew
    Mr. Behnia, he was a free-spirited, kind, generous, sincere, and
    forthright person and tried to help everybody. He was not very religious
    (Boroumand Center interview with a person with knowledge of the case). Mr.
    Ya qub Behnia s case relates to his lending of his car to a friend who was
    a member of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention On May 24,
    1982, Mr. Behnia was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards at his place of
    work. He spent the first 13 months of incarceration in a solitary
    confinement cell at Adelabad Prison, and was subsequently transferred to
    that prison s general ward upon advice of the doctor, due to developing
    kidney disease. After the solitary confinement period, Mr. Behnia was able
    to visit with his family once every two weeks for 10 to 15 minutes, from
    behind the glass in a visitation booth. At the first visitation, Mr.
    Behnia had become visibly frail. Mr. Behnia s mother did not speak Persian
    and talked to him in Turkish, to which the guards objected and warned them
    about, because they wanted to know the content of the conversation. He was
    then transferred to Gachsaran Prison. He was given leave on three
    occasions during which he tried to find out how all his relatives and
    friends were doing. According to a person with knowledge of the case, his
    personality had somewhat changed in prison; for instance, he had started
    to pray after he had spent some time in jail, though he had previously not
    been a religious person. Mr. Behnia was returned to Adelabad Prison before
    his execution, and his family had no news of him for six months (Boroumand
    Center interview with a person with knowledge of the case, electronic form
    sent to Boroumand Center). Trial Mr. Behnia was tried in a court in Shiraz
    after his arrest (Boroumand Center interview with a person with knowledge
    of the case). No information is available about the trial session(s) and
    where it actually took place. Furthermore, there is no precise information
    regarding how and under what conditions the trials that sentenced the defe
