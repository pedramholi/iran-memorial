    Mr. Abolghasem Afra’i is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and
    Particulars of Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    During the Period July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The
    report specifies that although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all
    probability" there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged
    victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh
    Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization along with 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims." Additional information about Mr. Afra’i is taken from a book
    titled "The Tudeh Martyrs" and an e-form sent to Boroumand Foundation by a
    person who knew him. He was born in Some'esara in 1939 and was a member of
    the Tudeh Party. He was married and had four children. After graduating
    from the Military College, he became a police officer and served in Jahrom
    Police Department during 1970s. The Tudeh Party of Iran was a
    Marxist-Leninist party and had very close ties with the Soviet Union. This
    party accepted, supported and never opposed the Islamic Republic regime in
    Iran. Arrest and detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. According to the book "The Tudeh
    Martyrs", Mr. Afra’i was arrested on May 1, 1983. He was allowed
    visitation and received several visits during his five years imprisonment;
    however, there is no information available about the dates and details of
    these visits. Trial Mr. Afra’i was tried and condemned to life
    imprisonment. No information is available about the trial sessions. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving at the time they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against
    the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict from the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims
    regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict,
    Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not
    believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also "waging
    war against God" and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defence No information is available about the defendant’s
    defence. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that
    defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court.
    Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrillas’
    operating near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their
    relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our children lived in
    most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a
    glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed during the
    past seven years that they were denied access to anything that would have
    allowed them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under
    such conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that
    these prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside
    Iran. Judgment No specific information is available about the defendant’s
    execution. According to the book "The Tudeh Martyrs", Mr. Afra’i was
    hanged in the Gohardasht prison in September 1988.
