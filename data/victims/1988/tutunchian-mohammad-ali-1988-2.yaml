    Information about Mr. Mohammad Ali Tutunchian has been sent to Omid via an
    electronic form. Mr. Tutunchian is one of 1000 people identified in a UN
    Human Rights Commission’s Special Representative’s Report, “Names and
    particulars of persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    during the period July-December 1988,” published January 26, 1989. His
    name is also mentioned in a booked published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization titled Crime Against Humanity , which documents the 1988-89
    mass execution of political prisoners. According to available information,
    he was born on March 30, 1952 into a religion family in Hamedan. After his
    graduation from high school, he entered the education college, majoring in
    applied sciences. In 1964, he was dismissed from college due to his
    political activities opposing the monarchy. One year later, he was
    admitted to the social science department of Tehran University. He
    continued his political activities, which resulted in his arrest and
    detention by Savak in 1967. He was released from prison in January 1980
    with the last group of political prisoners. He then began his political
    activities against the Islamic Republic. He was affiliated with the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Arrest and detention According to the
    electronic form, he was arrested in the morning of December 15, 1982. The
    sender of the form states the reasons invoked by authorities carrying out
    the arrest to be: “membership of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, arrest
    under the Shah regime, and escape from prison of the Islamic Republic in
    1981.” No further information is available about the reasons that led to
    his arrest. According to the same source, he was under interrogation and
    torture for 18 months. His locations of detention were Evin and Qezelhesar
    prisons. He was denied the right to be represented by an attorney. Trial
    According to the sender of the form, Mr. Tutunchian was tried in Evin
    prison. This trial, which lasted for 7 minutes, condemned him to 10 years
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Tutunchian and thousands of other individuals in
    1988 are not known. According to existing information, there was no
    official trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who
    were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges According to the available
    information, his first Trial charged Mr. Tutunchian with “membership of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization”. The form also mentions “imprisonment
    under the Shah regime”. No other information is available about the
    charges at the first trial. Whether or not other charges led to the
    execution sentence is not known. No charge has been publicly leveled
    against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the
    Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being “counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who do not
    believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also “waging
    war against God” and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The
    report does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense Mr. Tutunchian was denied the right to have
    an attorney. In their open letter, the families of the victims of the 1988
    mass executions noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that
    these prisoners (from inside the prison) had coll
