    The information about Ms. Nasrin Feizshandi has been sent to Omid, via an
    electronic form, by her former cellmate. Her name (mistakenly typed
    Shirin) is in the list of 3208 members and sympathizers of the People’s
    Mojahedin of Iran Organization (Mojahedin Khalq Organization) whose
    execution was reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity . This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. The majority of the executed prisoners were members
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and
    witnesses’ memoirs. was a victim of the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. Arrest and detention There is no specific information
    on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Ms. Feizshandi was arrested in
    1981. According to her cellmate, she spent the majority of the time in
    cells used for “punishment” of prisoners as well as solitary cells of
    Gohardasht prison. “She loved to read. Most of the time when I saw her,
    she was reading the books, which were available in prison.” Trial Specific
    details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of
    Ms. Feizshandi’s and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known.
    According to existing information, there was no official trial with the
    presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988
    were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about
    their beliefs and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of
    the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against
    the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms. Feizshandi’s
    defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners noted that
    defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court.
    The same letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners (from
    inside the prison) had collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin
    Organization in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states
    that such claims “are false considering the circumstances in prisons; for
    our children faced most difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation
    rights of once every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through
    a telephone from behind the glass window, and were deprived of any
    connection with the outside world. We faced such conditions for seven
    years, which proves the truth of our claim.” Judgment The details
    regarding the execution sentence are not available. Ms. Nasrin Feizshandi
    was hanged in Evin prison in the summer of 1988. According to the
    available information, months after the executions, prison authorities
    informed the families about the executions and handed in the victims’
    belongings to their families. The bodies, however, were not retu
