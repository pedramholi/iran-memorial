    Mr. Amir Nabavi, son of Ali (Working Class Freedom Fighters Organization),
    was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. Most of
    the executed prisoners were members and supporters of the Mojahedin e
    Khalq Organization of Iran. Other victims were from Marxist Leninist
    groups in opposition to the Islamic Republic, such as Fedayian Khalq
    Organization (Minority) and Paykar Organization, and members of parties
    such as Tudeh and Fedayian Khalq Organization (Majority), who were not
    actively opposing the Islamic Republic. Boroumand Center has collected
    additional information about these mass executions from The Memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri , Reports of Human Rights Organization, interviews
    with families, and eyewitness accounts. Information about Mr. Nabavi has
    been collected from an electronic form sent by one of his friends to
    Boroumand Center (September 16, 2021), from an interview with one of his
    cellmates (July 13, 2022), and also from an email from one of his friends
    (July 30, 2022). According to available information, Mr. Nabavi was 27. He
    was the oldest child in his family, born in Ahvaz, and single. His father
    got a job at Qazvin Glass Factory, and the family moved from Ahvaz to
    Qazvin when Mr. Nabavi was 7 years old. After a while, his father opened
    his own glass cutting shop and Mr. Nabavi used to work there every day
    after school. He finished his high school education at Rahnama High School
    in Qazvin. He was interested in martial arts. His brother was a cleric.
    Mr. Nabavi started his political activities in high school, in 1979, in
    the Pooya Students Association . He continued his activities by joining
    the Revolutionary Unity * Organization. After internal conflict in this
    organization, he was one of the people who helped form the Working Class
    Freedom Fighters'' Organization** and became a member of this group.
    According to one of his friends, The political atmosphere of 1978-1979
    favored guerilla activity. However, he did not follow this path, and he
    preferred to participate in activities that sought the freedom of the
    working classes through their education and their eventual rise to power.
    His political activities after the revolution included organizing
    photography exhibitions, setting up tables for selling books, distributing
    revolutionary pamphlets, writing slogans, and participating in protest
    demonstrations carried out by workers, university students, and high
    school students supporting the working classes. He was active in
    mountaineering activities (His comrade). Among his friends, he was known
    as a hardworking, active, and influential revolutionary. He had a warm
    voice and beautiful handwriting. As a result of his overt political
    activities, he was repeatedly threatened and harassed by officials of the
    Islamic Republic Regime. They pressured his family to force him to stop
    his political activities. (His comrade). He was arrested in 1980, at a
    literature exhibition, and he spent two months in jail. One of his
    cellmates , remembers: We were always together, in one section and in one
    cell. We talked together, we exercised together, we ate together, and we
    organized poetry nights together. Amir would sing his most beautiful
    emotions with that clear and pleasing voice of his. He continues, In
    addition to being kind and sincere, one of his prominent and admirable
    attributes was that he loved to talk, to exchange ideas, and to hear
    opposing views. He enjoyed reading, poetry, and literature, and he did not
    have the political prejudices and narrow mindedness prevalent in those
    times. In spite of our differing political views, I considered him my
    closest friend, as he did me. Amir was a learned intellectual, logical and
    moderate in demeanor. He was in search of the truth. He was not captivated
    by personalities, nor was he in awe of this group or that ideology. During
    his years in prison, he worked on himself and learned a lot. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Nabavi and one of his comrades were arrested by
    revolutionary guards and agents from the neighborhood committee, on August
    11, 1981, at his home in Hadi Abad neighborhood in Qazvin (a working-class
    neighborhood). This house had already been exposed for some time. They
    initially took him to the Revolutionary Guard Station on Naderi Street.
    After interrogation, they transferred him to Chubin Dar Prison in Qazvin.
    He spent some time in section 2 of Chubin Dar Prison. When the dissolution
    of this section, they moved him to sections 3 and 4 of the same prison. In
    February 1984, they exiled Mr. Nabavi, along with some of his comrades and
    some Mojahedin, to Gohar Dasht Prison. A year later, they took him back to
    Chubin Dar in Qazvin. Mr. Nabavi spent seven years in prison. Mr. Nabavi s
    family rarely visited him and did not have much contact with him. The
    reason for this was that his family, and especially his mother, were
    influenced by the propaganda of the regime. One of Mr. Nabavi s cellmates
    in Chubin Dar Prison in Qazvin in 1988 said, I
