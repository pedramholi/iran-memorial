    Mr. Hassan Mohammadzadeh Gazorgah is one of the victims in the mass
    killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In
    addition to members of those Marxist-Leninist organizations opposed to the
    Islamic Republic, activists of organizations that were not against the
    Islamic Republic were also among the victims of these mass killings. The
    information about Mr. Hassan Mohammadzadeh Gazorgah is taken from the book
    The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by The Tudeh Party of Iran
    Publications. He was born in Tehran. He was a worker and a member of the
    Tudeh Party. One brother, Javad, was executed during the mass killings of
    the political prisoners in 1988 and his other brother, Reza, died as a
    result of being tortured in 1983. They were all members of the Tudeh
    Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party
    ideology was Marxist- Leninist and it supported policies of the former
    Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran's political scene
    until it was banned for the second time following the August 19, 1953
    coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and
    the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and
    actively supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed
    the Islamic Republic, it became the target of government attacks in 1982
    when most of the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Mr. Hassan Mohammadzadeh Gazorgah was arrested while visiting
    his brother's house on April 27, 1983. He was kept at both Evin and
    Gohardasht prisons. Trial Mr. Hassan Mohammadzadeh Gazorgah was tried and
    condemned to six years imprisonment. There is no information about the
    trial, just as there is no specific information about any such trials that
    condemned thousands of political prisoners to death in a few months
    period. According to the available information, the Iranian authorities
    did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the
    presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had
    been questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of a
    religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the
    Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about
    their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was ever publicly levelled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the accusations against the prisoners that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the
    PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war
    against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available about his defense. In their open letter, the
    families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Our vsits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. Over the past seven years, we
    witnessed that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed
    them to establish contacts outside their prison walls." Under such
    conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that these
    prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside Iran. It
    is very possible that the pris
