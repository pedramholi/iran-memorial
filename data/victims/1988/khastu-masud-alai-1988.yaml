    Mas ud Ala i Khastu: born in Tehran, grandson of Ayatollah Taleqani, a
    sympathizer of the People s Mojahedin. Mr. Masud Ala'i Khastu is one of
    1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission's Special
    Representative's Report, "Names and particulars of persons allegedly
    executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the period July-December
    1988," published January 26, 1989. Additional information is collected
    from an e-form sent by a person who knew Mr. Ala i to Boroumand
    Foundation. Mr. Ala i was born in Tehran and was a grandson of Ayatollah
    Taleqani. The report specifies that, although 1000 names are mentioned,
    "In all probability," there were several thousand victims. "Most of the
    alleged victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the
    Tudeh Party, the People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rah-e Kargar, the Komala
    Organization, and 11 mullahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims." Mr. Ala'i Khastu is also among 3208 members and sympathizers of
    the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO), whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity.
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention No specific information is available on Mr.
    Alai' Khastu's arrest and detention. Trial The circumstances that led to
    this defendant's execution are unknown. However, relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is the proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners;
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMIO's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available regarding the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense
    In their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants
    were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerillas operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most dif
