    Mr. Ali-Ashraf Namdari is among 3208 members and sympathizers of The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) whose execution was reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity. This book
    documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. Additional
    information was drawn from the Bidaran website. Additional information has
    been sent via an electronic form to Boroumand Foundation. According to the
    electronic form, Mr. Namdari was born in Asad Abad in Hamedan province. He
    was a Police Officer at the Passport Office in Tehran. According to this
    form, Mr. Namdari was a hardworking man. Mr. Ali Ashraf Namdari was a
    victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority
    of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports by human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs.
    Mr. Namdari is among 3208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization whose execution was reported by the organization in a book
    entitled Crime Against Humanity . Additional information is taken from his
    nephew’s weblog. According to the information available, Mr. Namdari’s
    sister-in-law’s brother, named Mr. Behzad Mohajer, was killed during the
    mass protests to the results of presidential elections in June 2009. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members’ interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah’s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization’s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders.* Arrest and detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial Specific details about the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Namdari and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with attorneys or
    prosecutors. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they
    argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of
    their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly stated against the
    victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of
    Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in
    February 2003, the families of the victims refer to the authorities’
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being “counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An
