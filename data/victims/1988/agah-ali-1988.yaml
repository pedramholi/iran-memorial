    He stood out for his academic abilities and attended a top school. As a
    young teen, he was arrested for selling copies of a political newspaper.
    Information about Mr. Ali Agah was gathered from an interview conducted by
    the Boroumand Foundation with a relative. Mr. Agah is also listed among
    3,208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose
    executions were reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity. He is also one of 1000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission s Special Representative s Report, published on January
    26, 1989. The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information
    regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri,
    reports from Human Rights organizations, and interviews with witnesses and
    victims families, as well as information from the Bidaran website. * Mr.
    Agah, son of Hazratqoli, was born in Mashhad on December 22, 1967. He was
    the only son, and a bright student, who attended a special school for
    gifted students in Mashhad. During the revolution, when society became
    politicized, Ali got involved in political activities. His activities
    included selling and distributing publications of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. ** Arrest and Detention Mr. Ali Agah was first arrested for
    selling newspapers in June of 1981. He was detained for two weeks. He was
    arrested again on a city bus on November 17, 1981, when he was only 14
    years old. He had no visitation for four months until he went to court. He
    continued his education in prison and graduated from high school while in
    prison. In 1986, authorities allowed some prisoners to participate in the
    national college admission exam. Ali was accepted as an electrical
    engineering major at Polytechnic University. Later, however, his family
    received a letter stating his ineligibility to attend the university.
    During a visitation, Ali told his family that he only wanted to
    demonstrate that he could be accepted at the university in spite of his
    situation. International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment
    against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the
    crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
    Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid
    capital punishment for an offense committed before the age of eighteen.
    Trial Specific details of the circumstances of Mr. Agah s first trial are
    not known. A second trial took place in his absence in 1986 and resulted
    in a ten-year imprisonment. According to an interviewee, the court ruling
    would be suspended if he agreed to appear in a televised interview. He was
    taken, along with his two friends, Ali Sa idi and Ali Ahmadi, whose cases
    were similar and who were executed together in 1988, to the Revolutionary
    Guards base and were asked whether they would do a [confession] interview.
    Since they rejected this demand, they were condemned to ten years
    imprisonment. They could be released whenever they accepted the condition,
    but they never accepted such a demand. An assistant judge in Vakilabad
    Prison once told Mr. Agah s family that these kids became political in
    prison and wouldn t be released. According to the testimonies of some of
    the political prisoners who were tried in some of the prisons during the
    executions of the summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room in the
    prison after a few weeks o
