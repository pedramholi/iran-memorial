    The information about Mr. Safdar Azadmehr has been sent to Omid via an
    electronic form by a person familiar with this case. Mr. Azadmehr is also
    among 3208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khlaq Organization
    whose execution was reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity . He is one of the victims of the 1988-89 mass executions
    of political prisoners whose name is published in a November 2, 1989
    Report of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, on the
    “Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran,” prepared by
    Mr. Reynaldo Galindo Pohl (El Salvador), Special Representative of the
    Commission on Human Rights. Executed prisoners were mostly members or
    sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khlaq Organization, or other Marxist
    Leninist organizations such as, the Fadaiyan Khlaq Organization, the Tudeh
    Party, and the Peykar Organization. Mr. Safdar Azadmenr, son of Ahmad and
    born in Kermanshah, began his political activities, in affiliation with
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, when he was student at Sari University.
    The sender of the electronic form remembers him as someone who always
    wanted to help others. Arrest and detention Mr. Azadmehr was arrested in
    October 1981 and transferred to Evin prison. Until a few months before his
    execution, he had contacts with his family members. No further information
    is available regarding his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Azadmehr was
    tried and condemned to life imprisonment. Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Azadmehr and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with the presence of an
    attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges At his first trial, Mr. Azadmehr was charged
    with sympathizing with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. No charge has
    been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In
    their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Azadmehr’s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting
    the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had
    collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes
    with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are
    false considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced
    most difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once
    every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone
    from behind the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the
    outside world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the
    truth of our claim.” Judgment According to the sender of the electronic
    form, Mr. Safdar Azadmehr was shot by firing squad in October 1988 at Evin
    prison. According to available information, months after the executions,
    prison authorities informed the families about the executions and handed
    in the victims’ belongings to their families. The bodies, however, were
    not returned to them. The bodies were buried i
