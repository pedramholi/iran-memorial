    Mr. Siamak Almasi was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners
    in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    by human rights organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and
    witnesses’ memoirs. Mr. Almasi is one of the 430 “Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class” published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Nima
    Parvaresh also refers to Mr. Alamsi’s execution in the book The Unequal
    Battle: A Report of Seven Years in Prison 1982-1989 (Andeesheh va Peykar
    Publications: 1995). The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention There
    is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Almasi and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not
    known. According to available information, the Iranian authorities did not
    try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with the presence of
    defense lawyers. The prisoners executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly stated against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their
    letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities’ accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the MKO as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam
    and “wage war against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also “waging war against God”
    and should be sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the
    MKO, may have been accused of being “anti-religion” for not having
    renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Almasi’s
    defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that
    defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court.
    The same letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners (from
    inside the prison) had collaborated with armed members of the MKO in
    clashes with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims
