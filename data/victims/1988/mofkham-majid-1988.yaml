    Information about Mr. Majid Mofkham, son of Khalil, born in Tehran, was
    gathered from an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a
    person familiar with his case. Mr. Majid Mofkham is also listed among
    3,208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose
    executions were reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity . The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional
    information regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports from human rights organizations, interviews with the
    witnesses and victims families, as well as from the Bidaran website. * The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and to recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. ** Arrest and detention No specific information is available on
    Mr. Majid Mofkham 's arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Majid Mofkham had
    been condemned to 8 years imprisonment during his first trial. No
    information is available on his second trial. According to the testimonies
    of some of the political prisoners who were tried during the executions of
    the summer of 1988 in Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the trials took place
    in a room on the ground floor of the prison, after a few weeks of
    isolation, during which prisoners were deprived of visitation, television
    and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and September, a
    three-member delegation, composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor;
    Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge; and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi,
    representative of the Ministry of Information, asked prisoners questions
    about their views on Mojahedin, whether they would renounce their beliefs,
    and if they were ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what
    the answers were, the prisoners would have been charged with
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion and anti-Islam, or associated with
    military action or with various [opposition] groups based near the
    borders, and would be sentenced to death. The authorities never informed
    prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious implications of
    their responses. According to survivors, during the summer of 1988, a
    large number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or Leftist
    groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then-Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed when they were retried and sentenced to death.
    Charges During his first trial, the charge against Mr. Majid Mofkham was
    announced as, writing slogans on walls. No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988) and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being,
    associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, r
