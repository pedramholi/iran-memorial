    Information about Mr. Ali Asghar Qabakhlu is taken from the book, The
    Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001 by The Tudeh Party of Iran publications. He
    was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The
    Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information regarding the
    1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from the
    human rights organizations, interviews with witnesses and victims
    families, as well as from the Bidaran website. The majority of executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims
    included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such
    as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which
    opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan
    Khalq (Majority), which did not. According to the existing information,
    Mr. Ali Asghar Qabakhlu was born in the Dolatabad village near Garmsar.
    After his high school graduation, he studied physics at Tehran University.
    He was an activist at the university when he was arrested and condemned to
    two years imprisonment for his political activities. He was released
    before the Revolution and joined the Tudeh Party. During the "Cultural
    Revolution," he was expelled from the university and continued his
    political activities in Garmsar. * The Tudeh Party of Iran ( Hezbe Tudeh
    or the Party of the Masses) was founded in 1941 by a group of mostly
    communist intellectuals. Its non-radical reformist platform and its name
    reflected the founders hopes to attract the larger religious population.
    However, the Party's Marxist-Leninist orientation and its anti-Imperialist
    and anti-Fascist positions made it most influential among intellectuals
    and educated Iranians. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, The Tudeh , with
    its country-wide organization, including active women, youth, and labor
    groups, as well as a secret military network ( Sazman-e Nezami-ye Hezb-e
    Tudeh Iran ), played a major role in Iran s political scene. The Tudeh was
    banned following an attempted assassination against the Shah in 1949.
    Nonetheless, the Party continued its activities, as well as its
    publications, of which there would be many. Following the 19 August 1953
    coup, the Tudeh s military network was annihilated, and many of its
    leaders were arrested or forced into exile, mostly in the Soviet Union and
    Eastern Europe. Over the years, the Party s political influence
    diminished, due to the various splits resulting from its pro-Soviet stand
    and policies in periods of political tension in Iran and from the
    radicalization of the left in the 1960s and 1970s. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Tudeh declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported and
    collaborated with the government. Though the Party never opposed the
    Islamic Republic, it became the target of its attacks in 1982, and the
    Party's leaders and many members, including those of the new secret
    military network, were arrested. The Tudeh lost scores of its members
    during the mass prison killing of 1988. Following several splits, the
    Party resumed its activities in the early 1990s in exile. Arrest and
    detention There is no specific information on Mr. Ali Asghar Qabakhlu s
    arrest and detention. He was arrested in 1983. Trial Mr. Ali Asghar
    Qabakhlu had been tried and condemned to life imprisonment. Specific
    details about the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of
    Mr. Ali Asghar Qabakhlu are unknown. No information is available about the
    trial sessions. According to the testimonies of leftist political
    prisoners who were tried in Evin and Gohardasht Prisons during the
    executions of the summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room on the
    ground floor of the prison, after a few weeks of isolation, during which
    prisoners were deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts,
    and outdoor time. Toward the end of August, a three-member delegation
    composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri,
    the religious judge; and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of
    the Ministry of Information asked prisoners questions about whether they
    were Muslim or Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were
    practicing Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the latter were
    sentenced to be hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The
    authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and
    the serious implications of their responses. During the summer of 1988,
    according to survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing with the
    Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs.
    The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality
    of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to the Minister of Justice at
    the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding
    these executions i
