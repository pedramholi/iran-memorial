    The information about Mr. Bijan Eslami Eshbela, son of Baba, has been
    drawn from an interview with a family friend. Mr. Eslami Eshbela was a
    victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority
    of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from Ayatollah Montazeri’s memoirs, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs.
    Mr. Eslami Eshbela was born in 1961 in the Eshbela village near Bandar
    Anzali in the Gilan province. He started his political activism at the
    time of the Revolution. According to the interviewee, Mr. Eslami Eshbela
    was neat,organized, and had a good sense of humor. Mr. Eslami Eshbela was
    a sympathizer of the Ashraf Dehqani Branch of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization. He was steadfast in his political beliefs and despite a lack
    of contact with the Organization for some time prior to his arrest, he was
    still mentally and emotionally attached to it. The Fadayian Khalq Guerilla
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. A
    number of the Organization’s members, who did not renounce armed struggle,
    founded the group the Fadayian Khalq Guerillas (the Ashraf Dehqani
    Branch). Arrest and detention There is no specific information about Mr.
    Eslami Eshbela’s arrest and detention other than he was arrested in Tehran
    in 1985. Trial Mr. Eslami Eshbela was tried and condemned to three years
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to his execution and of thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not
    known. According to existing information, there was no official trial
    during which Mr. Eslami Eshbela was in the presence of an attorney or
    prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly stated against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice in1988, and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities’ accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization named by the leader of
    the Islamic Republic, may have been accused of being “anti-religion” for
    not having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Eslami Eshbela’s defense. In their open letter, the families of the
    prisoners noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend
    themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that these
    prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed members of
    the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed
