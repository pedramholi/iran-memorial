    The information about Mr. Reza Qoreishi Langrudi was taken from an
    interview with a family friend. Mr. Qoreishi Langrudi was a victim of the
    mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims
    included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such
    as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which
    opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan
    Khalq (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has
    been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports by human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Mr. Qoreishi Langrudi, son of Mirnaqi,
    was born in 1948 in Shahsavar (also known as Tonekabon in Mazandaran
    province). He was married and had a daughter. Mr. Qoreishi Langrudi was a
    prominent leftist political activist. Due to his activities he was
    imprisoned under the Shah’s regime. In prison, he was seen as an important
    figure that resisted the demands of prison authorities and fellow
    prisoners loved and respected him. His wife, sister, and brother-in-law
    were also imprisoned in the 1980s. His brother-in-law, Mansur Musavi, was
    executed in the summer of 1988. Mr. Qoreishi Langrudi was one of founders
    and leaders of the Razmandegan Organization. The Razmandegan Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded in the winter of 1979.
    Its activities were focused on the working class and factories. The
    founding tenets of Razmandegan included the rejection of armed struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. It viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state and
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles.
    Razmandegan was among the groups that became known as Khat-e Se (Third
    line). By early 1981, disagreements on the Party’s position on the
    Iran-Iraq war caused internal splits in Razmandegan. These splits, which
    coincided with the massive and brutal repression of dissidents by the
    Iranian government, caused the Organization to disband. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Qoreishi Langrudi was arrested in Tehran 1983. No further
    information is available about his arrest and detention. Trial Specific
    details about the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of
    Mr. Qoreishi Langrudi and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not
    known. According to existing information, there was no official trial with
    attorneys or prosecutors. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This
    committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs
    and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue
    that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed when they were retried and sentenced to death.
    Charges No charge has been publicly stated against the victims of the 1988
    mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988, and
    to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the families
    of the victims refer to the authorities’ accusations against the prisoners
    – accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as
    well as being “associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, may have been accused of being “anti-religion” for not
    having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Qoreishi
    Langrudi’s defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    noted that defendants were not given th
