    Mr. Mohsen Delijani is one of the victims in the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In addition to members
    of those Marxist-Leninist organizations oppose to the Islamic Republic of
    organizations that were not against the Islamic Republic were also among
    the victims of this mass killings. The information about Mr. Mohsen
    Delijani is taken from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by
    The Tudeh Party Publications. He was a member of the Tudeh Party. The
    Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported the former Soviet Union's policies. The
    Party played a major role in Iran's political scene until it was banned
    for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the
    new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The date of Mr.
    Mohsen Delijani's arrested is unknown. He was detained at Evin and
    Gohardasht prisons. Trial Mr. Mohsen Delijani was tried and condemned to
    life imprisonment. Whether or not a second trial condemned him to death is
    unknown. According to the available information, the Iranian authorities
    did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the
    presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had
    been questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of a
    religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the
    Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about
    their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was ever publicly levelled against
    the victims of the 1988 mass execution. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced
    in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor,
    corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against the
    executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's
    members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against
    God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken
    by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization
    named by the leader of the Islamic Republic, may have been accused of
    being "anti-religion" for not having renounced his or her beliefs.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families
    of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were
    associated with guerrilla forces operating near the borders, the families
    submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside during their
    detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were
    limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two
    weeks. We witnessed, over the past seven years, that they were denied
    access to anything that would have allowed them to establish contacts
    outside their prisons' walls." Under such conditions the families reject
    the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were able to engage with
    the political groups outside Iran. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the death sentence. Mr. Mohsen Delijani was hanged during
    the mass killings of political prisoners in September, 1988.
