    Mr. Mahshid (Hossein) Razzaqi is one of 1000 people identified in a UN
    Human Rights Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and
    particulars of persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    during the period July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The
    report specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, "in all
    probability" there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged
    victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh
    Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims." Mr. Razzaqi is also listed among 3208 members and sympathizers
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) whose execution was reported by
    the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . Further
    information was sent to Omid via an electronic form from a person familiar
    with this case. Mr. Razzaqi was born in Shemiran (Tehran). He was a
    sympathizer of the MKO and a professional soccer player. Until the age of
    23, he was member of the National Omid team. The peak of his career as an
    athlete was between 1977 and 1979 when he was a member of the Homa team.
    In addition to soccer, he was good at volleyball and marshal arts.
    According to the electronic form, he was a member of the Sa’d Abad
    Committee from February of 1979 until about two months prior to his
    arrest. Arrest and detention According to the form, Mr. Razzaqi’s brother
    was arrested for selling anti-Islamic regime newspapers on December 13,
    1980 by the Sa’d Committee. The next day Mr. Razzaqi went to the Committee
    and identified himself as the owner of the newspaper kiosk and his brother
    was freed. After his arrest Mr. Razzaqi’s was asked by his former
    colleagues at the Committee to identify himself on the interrogation
    papers. He inquired if that was necessary since he had worked at the
    Committee, but his colleagues denied knowing him. He, thus, identified
    himself under a false name and received a one-year prison sentence for
    doing so. Mr. Razzaqi was first detained in Evin and later in Qezelhesar
    prisons. His prison term ended on December 14, 1981, however due to such
    events as the demonstration of June 20, 1981 and the repression of
    political opposition, he was not freed from prison. According to one of
    his cellmates, quoted on MKO website, "in May of 1985, they transferred
    "Mellikeshha" (those who had completed their prison terms but were not
    released) to the Evin prison. One day, they took us for interrogation. The
    interrogator asked Mahshid Razzaqi to condemn the Mojahedin in a speech in
    the Tajrish Mosque in order to be released. He refused and the
    interrogator angrily said: "Then, go and stay [in prison] until you rot."
    After this event, he was transferred a few times between Evin, Gohardasht,
    and Qezelhesar prisons (electronic form). The demonstration of June 20,
    1981, took place in protest against the parliament’s impeachment of
    President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic’s systematic policy of
    excluding the MKO from the country’s political scene, the refusal of
    Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO leaders and his insistence for them to
    disarm. The MKO had until then supported the leadership of Ayatollah
    Khomeini and agreed to function within the framework of the new political
    system. On June 20th, the Organization officially changed its policy and
    tried to overthrow the regime by organizing mass demonstrations, in which
    some of the demonstrators were armed, all over the country. These
    demonstrations, which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing
    of dozens of demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and
    executions by the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that
    targeted not only the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive
    repression, unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic,
    legitimized as official government policy the months-old state harassment
    and suppression of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of
    independent political dissent. Trial In his first trial, Mr. Razzaqi was
    condemned to one year imprisonment. There is no information about the
    trial sessions or its location. Also, specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Razzaqi and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with the presence of an
    attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This
    committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs
    and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice
