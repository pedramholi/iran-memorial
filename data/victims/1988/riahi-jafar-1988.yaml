    Mr. Ja far Riahi s name, an affiliate of the Rah-e Kargar Organization, is
    taken from the book Those Who Said No , published in 1999 in Paris by the
    Association for the Defense of Political Prisoners and Prisoners of
    Conscience in Iran. He was a victim of the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    by human rights organizations, interviews with victims families, and
    witnesses memoirs. Rah-e Kargar or the Revolutionary Workers Organization
    of Iran was established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was
    founded by individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea
    of armed struggle and believed in political action. They identified
    themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the
    leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist
    party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah
    Khomeini s leadership. Arrest and detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial Specific
    details about the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of
    Mr. Riahi and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known.
    According to existing information, there was no official trial with
    attorneys or prosecutors. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This
    committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs
    and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue
    that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed when they were retried and sentenced to death.
    Charges No charge has been publicly stated against the victims of the 1988
    mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988, and
    to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the families
    of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as
    well as being associated with military action or with various [opposition]
    groups based near the borders. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic
    Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims
    regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict,
    Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    as hypocrites who do not believe in Islam and wage war against God and
    decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this
    organization are also waging war against God and should be sentenced to
    death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization,
    may have been accused of being anti-religion for not having renounced his
    or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Riahi s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting
    the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had
    collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    clashes with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims
    are false considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced
    the most difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once
    every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone
    from behind the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the
    outside world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the
    truth of our claim. Judgment The details regarding the execution sentence
    are not available. According to available information, leftist prisoners
    executed in 1988 were found to be apostates. Months after the executions,
    prison authorities informed the famil
