    Information about Mr. Reza Mohammadi Bahman Abadi was gathered from an
    electronic form, sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a relative, and an
    article written by her sister s cellmate on the Mojahedin Khalq website.
    Mr. Reza Mohammadi Bahman Abadi is also listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were
    reported by the organization in a book titled Crime Against Humanity . He
    is also one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission s
    Special Representative s Report, published on January 26, 1989. The
    Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information regarding the
    1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from the
    human rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims
    families, as well as the Bidaran website. * Mr. Reza Mohammadi Bahman
    Abadi was a civil engineer who had graduated from Tehran University. He
    was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and was active in
    the social department of this organization. According to a cellmate of his
    sister, Maryam, who was executed during the mass killings of political
    prisoners in Evin Prison in the summer of 1988, Maryam was always talking
    highly about her brother, Reza, and considered him successful and much
    loved. Mr. Reza Mohammadi Bahman Abadi was first arrested in 1981 but was
    released in 1985 after completing his prison term. In 1983, he was
    transferred to the place called the grave where prisoners were put in
    between wooden panels, like graves, and were physically and mentally
    tortured in silence. According to Maryam s cellmate, after his release,
    Reza accompanied his mother to visit Maryam at Qezelhesar prison. The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and to recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. ** Arrest and Detention Mr. Reza Mohammadi Bahman Abadi was
    arrested for the second time in 1987. According to his sister s cellmate,
    Maryam pointed out that the reason for her brother s second arrest was
    going to Karbala, referring to joining the Mojahedin Khalq Freedom Army at
    the border with Iraq. The circumstances of Mr. Mohammadi Bahman Abadi s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial According to his sister s
    cellmate, Mr. Reza Mohammadi Bahman Abadi had been condemned to six years
    imprisonment after his second arrest. However, No information is available
    on his trial. According to the testimonies of some of the political
    prisoners who were tried during the executions of the summer of 1988 in
    Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the trials took place in a room on the ground
    floor of the prison after a few weeks of isolation, during which prisoners
    were deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor
    time. In August and September, a three-member delegation - composed of
    Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious
    judge; and Hojatoleslam Pourmohamadi, the representative of the Ministry
    of Information - asked prisoners questions about their views on the
    Mojahedin, whether they would renounce their beliefs, and if they were
    ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were,
    the prisoners would have been charged with counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion and anti-Islam, or, associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders, and would be sentenced
    to death. The authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s
    purpose and the serious implications of their respon
