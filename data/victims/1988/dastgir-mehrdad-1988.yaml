    Mr. Mehrdad Dastgir is a victim in the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. Many of the executed prisoners were members or
    sympathizers of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI, also
    known as MKO). However, members or supporters of Marxist Leninist
    organizations such as, the People’s Fedayian of Iran (Minority) or Peykar,
    which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and
    Fadayian Khalq (Majority), which did not oppose the regime, were among the
    victims. Complementary information has been gathered from the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews
    with family members, and memoirs of witnesses by the Boroumand Foundation.
    The information about Mr. Mehrdad Dastgir is taken from the book The
    Martyrs of the Tuden Party of Iran by The Tudeh Party Publications. He was
    a high school student and a member of the Youth Organization of the Tudeh
    Party. He sold Tudeh publications on the street. The Tudeh Party of Iran
    was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it
    supported the former Soviet Union's policies. The Party played a major
    role in Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second time
    following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh
    Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention Mr. Mehrdad
    Dastgir was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards on the street as he was
    selling the Party’s publications in May, 1982 and he was taken to Evin
    Prison. Trial Mr. Mehrdad Dastgir was tried and condemned to life
    imprisonment. Whether or not a second trial condemned him to death is not
    known. According to the available information, the Iranian authorities did
    not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the
    presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had
    been questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of a
    religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the
    Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about
    their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was ever publicly levelled against
    the victims of the 1988 mass execution. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced
    in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor,
    corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against the
    executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's
    members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against
    God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken
    by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. It is possible that the prisoners who were members of
    organizations other than the MKO were charge for being "anti religious"
    and were condemned for insisting on their beliefs. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves
    in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with
    guerrilla forces operating near the borders, the families submit the
    isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our
    children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10
    minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We
    witnessed, over the past seven years, that they were denied access to
    anything that would have allowed them to establish contacts outside their
    prisons' walls." Under such conditions the families reject the claim of
    the author
