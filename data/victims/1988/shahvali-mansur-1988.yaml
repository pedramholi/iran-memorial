    The information about Mr. Mansur Shahvali is based on an interview by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with his cellmate, and an electronic form
    sent to Omid by him. Mr. Shahvali is also listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information regarding
    the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from
    the Human Rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims
    families as well as from the Bidaran website. [*] According to the
    existing information, Mr. Shahvali was born in Khoramshahr. He was single
    and a high school graduate. He entered the university in 1977 and first
    studied computer science. However, after the Iran Iraq war began, he
    migrated, along with his family, to Bushehr in 1980. He was a sympathizer
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. His younger brother, Naser Shahvali,
    was also executed during the mass killing of political prisoners in
    Bushehr in 1988. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in
    1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    s leaders. [**] Arrest and detention According to the interviewee, Mr.
    Shahvali was arrested in Bushehr in 1982. After about two years, he was
    transferred, along with other prisoners, to the Adelabad Prison in Shiraz
    in order to repent them. He was detained two more years after his sentence
    was completed. In the summer of 1986, he was transferred back to the
    Shekari Prison in Bushehr to stand another trial. His cellmate recalls
    their first meeting in the prison: In an afternoon, the section door was
    opened suddenly and a person was thrown inside while being beaten. He
    resisted his interrogators severe pressure to make him repentant and was a
    symbol of resistance among the prisoners. For this, they detained him in
    Section 49, known as the place for dogs. According to this cellmate,
    pressure and tortures included sleep deprivation for days, daily beating,
    and solitary confinement. In addition, with collaboration of repentant
    prisoners, they tried to break any resistance, make every prisoner
    repentant, and also brain-washed them by chanting collective slogans
    constantly. Mr. Shahvali was not allowed to speak and was kept in
    isolation for some time. Even when they sent him to solitary confinement,
    he was not spared torture. According to his cellmate, quoting some
    repentant prisoners, Do you think we leave Mansur alone in solitary
    confinement? We go there and give him a good beating every day! The prison
    conditions were very bad and sometimes up to 70 prisoners were kept in a
    section of not more than 70 square meters. Finally, in the fall of 1987,
    Mr. Shahvali was transferred, along with other prisoners, from Shekari
    Prison to the newly built Markazi Prison in Bushehr. There was a section
    for political prisoners in this new prison. Mr. Shahvali s family could
    visit him for 20 minutes biweekly. Visitations took place from behind two
    fences in Shekari Prison, and in booths with phones in Markazi Prison. No
    information is available about whether he had any visitation while in
    solitary confinement. Trial According to the interviewee, Mr. Shahvali was
    first tried and condemned to two years imprisonment in Bushehr Prison in
    1982. After his sentence was competed, he was detained for another two
    years and transferred to the Adelabad Prison in Shiraz. After two years,
    he was returned to Bushehr for a re-tr
