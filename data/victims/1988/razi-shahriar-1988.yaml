    Mr Shahriar Razi, a member of the Ranjbaran Party, is one of the victims
    of the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Many of the executed prisoners were members or
    sympathizers of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI also
    known as MKO). However, members or supporters of Marxist Leninist
    organizations such as, the People’s Fadayian of Iran (minority) or Peykar,
    which opposed the Islamic Republic, and the Tudeh Party, which did not
    oppose the regime, were also among the victims. Additional information
    about Mr. Razi, born in Tehran in 1959, is gathered from a book titled
    Siavoshan, “Remembrance of the Ranjbaran Party of Iran’s Martyrs” by Baqer
    Mortazavi, Germany, copyright 1999. The main body of the Ranjbaran Party
    consisted of the members of the Revolutionary Organization of Tudeh Party
    which was formed outside of Iran after the coup d’état of 1953. This
    organization was opposed to the Soviet Union as Social Imperialists, and
    the Tudeh party as its agent. They were followers of Mao Tse-tung. Arrest
    and detention There is no detailed information about the defendant’s
    arrest and detention. Mr. Razi was arrested in Tehran in 1985. Trial The
    circumstances that led to this defendant's execution are unknown. However,
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving at the time they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge was publicly levelled
    against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988),
    and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February, 2003), the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the
    prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims
    regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict,
    Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not
    believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also "waging
    war against God" and should be sentenced to death. The defendant, who did
    not belong to the organization named by the leader of the Islamic
    Republic, may have been accused of being "anti-religion" for not having
    renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families of the
    prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend
    themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated
    with guerillas operating near the borders, the families submit the
    isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our
    children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10
    minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We
    witnessed during the past seven years that they were denied access to
    anything that would have allowed them to establish contacts outside their
    prisons' walls." Under such conditions the families reject the claim of
    the authorities that these prisoners were able to engage with the
    political groups outside Iran. Judgment No sentence was issued publicly.
    According to the existing information, Mr. Razi was hung in September of
    1988 along with hundreds of other prisoners.
