    Mr. Mohammad Reza Dalili is one of the victims in the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. In addition to members of
    those Marxist-Leninist organizations oppose to the Islamic Republic
    members of organizations that were not against the Islamic Republic were
    also among the victims of this mass killings. The information about Mr.
    Mohammad Reza Dalili is taken from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party
    of Iran by The Tudeh Party Publications. He had a bachelors degree in
    Economics from Tehran University. He worked in the Census Bureau and the
    Atlas Copco company. Before the revolution, along with his brother, Ali
    Reza, (who was executed at the same time), he joined the Navid
    Organization (the Tudeh Party underground organization). The Tudeh Party
    of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist
    and it supported the former Soviet Union's policies. The Party played a
    major role in Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second
    time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the
    Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention Mr. Mohammad
    Reza Dalili was arrested on April 29, 1983. He was first taken to the
    Joint Committee and then to Evin Prison. Trial Mr. Mohammad Reza Dalili
    was tried and condemned to 12 years imprisonment. Whether or not a second
    trial condemned him to death is unknown. According to the available
    information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of the 1988
    mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense lawyer. The
    prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member
    special committee, composed of a religious judge, a representative of the
    Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned
    the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and their faith in God and
    religion. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice
    Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed serving at the
    time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly levelled against the victims of the 1988 mass execution. In their
    letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. It is possible that the prisoners who
    were members of organizations other than the Mojahedin Khalq were charge
    for being "anti religious" and were condemned for insisting on their
    beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the
    families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed, over the past seven
    years, that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed
    them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such
    conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that these
    prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside Iran.
    Judgment No specific information is available about the death sentence.
