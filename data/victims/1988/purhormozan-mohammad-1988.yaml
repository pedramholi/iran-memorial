    Mr. Mohammad Purhormozan was a victim in the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In addition to members of those
    Marxist-Leninist organizations opposed to the Islamic Republic, activists
    of organizations that were not against the Islamic Republic were also
    among the victims of these mass killings. The information about Mr.
    Mohammad Purhormozan is taken from the book The Martyrs of the Tuden Party
    of Iran by The Tudeh Party Publications. He was born in Tehran in 1921,
    and was a member of the Tudeh Party. In 1943, he graduated from the
    Military College. Two years later, he was one of the organizers of the
    Officers Uprising. With the defeat of this uprising, he escaped to
    Azerbaijan and joined the Democrat Party. He was condemned to death in
    absentia. In 1947, he went to the Soviet Union. During this period, he
    translated more than one hundred works by Lenin, Marx, Engels, and some
    Russian novelists into Farsi. After the revolution, he returned to Iran
    and was given responsibility for all publications of the Tudeh Party. The
    Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies the former Soviet Union. The
    Party played a major role in Iran's political scene until it was banned
    for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the
    new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The details of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Mohammad
    Purhormozan was arrested in early 1983. Trial According to the available
    information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of the 1988
    mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense lawyer. The
    prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member
    special committee, composed of a religious judge, a representative of the
    Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned
    the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and their faith in God and
    religion. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice
    Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed serving at the
    time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly levelled against the victims of the 1988 mass execution. In their
    letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the accusations against the prisoners that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced
    in the memoirs of his designated successor Ayatollah Montazeri,
    corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against the
    executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMIO's
    members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "who wage war
    against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. It is very possible that the prisoners who were
    members of other political organizations were charged for being "anti
    religious" and were condemned for insisting on their beliefs. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence provided against
    the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves
    in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with
    guerrilla forces operating near the borders, the families submit the
    isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our
    children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10
    minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We
    witnessed, over the past seven years, that they were denied access to
    anything that would have allowed them to establish contacts outside their
    prisons' walls." Under such conditions the families reject the claim of
    the authorities that these prisoners were able to engag
