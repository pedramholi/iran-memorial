    After the revolution, Mr. Namdari Masjedi started his own political
    association. The doors he opened there were soon closed, from the outside.
    Mr. Shahrokh Namdari Masjedi is listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims families, and witnesses memoirs.
    Other information about Mr. Namdari Masjedi has been drawn from an
    electronic form sent to Omid by a relative, and the MKO website. Mr.
    Namdari Masjedi was born in Masjed-e Soleyman. He was a high school
    graduate and a MKO sympathizer. After the revolution, he established a
    political association. The Revolutionary Guards suppressed the meetings of
    this association. After that, Mr. Namdar Masjedi joined the MKO. In the
    summer of 1979, he was arrested for his work with the MKO. After his
    release from prison, he became a full time political activist. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    unknown. According to the MKO website, Mr. Namdari Masjedi was arrested in
    Mahshahr on April 4, 1985. He was transferred to the Masjed-e Soleyman
    prison (Khuzestan province). Trial Mr. Namdari Masjedi was tried and
    condemned to seven years imprisonment. Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Namdari
    Masjedi and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known.
    According to existing information, there was no official trial with the
    presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988
    were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about
    their beliefs and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of
    the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against
    the prisoners accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An edict of the Leader
    of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as hypocrites who do not believe in Islam and wage war
    against God and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also waging war against God and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrillas operating near the borders, the
    families submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside during
    their detention: Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits
    were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone
    every two weeks. We witnessed during the past seven years that they were
    denied access to anything that would have allowed them to establish
    contacts outside their prison walls. Under such conditions the families
    reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were able to
    engage with the political groups outside Iran. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the defendant s execution. According to the
    MKO website, Mr. Namdari Masjedi was hanged in the Masjed-e Soleyman
    prison in 1988. His body was buried in a mass grave. According to the same
    source, his family were not informed about his execution and when they
    went for visitation, the officials gave a Koran, a Nahjolbalagheh, and h
