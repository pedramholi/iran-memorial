    Mr. Mohsen Ghiasvand, one of the members of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization (Majority), was a victim of the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and
    witnesses’ memoirs. The information about Mr. Ghiasvand has been drawn
    from the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization as well as an interview with an
    individual familiar with this case. His name is also mentioned in the book
    Those Who Said No , listing the victims of the 1988 massacre, published by
    the Paris-based Association for the Defense of Political Prisoners and
    Prisoners of Conscience in Iran. Mr. Ghiasvand was born in Malayer
    (Hamedan province) and lived in Tehran. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Majority considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and
    anti-imperialist regime and supported it. After the spring of 1983,
    however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely because of their
    political beliefs. Arrest and detention There is no specific information
    on the defendant’s arrest and detention, other than he was arrested in
    July or August 1986. Trial Mr. Mohsen Ghiasvand was tried and sentenced to
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Ghiasvand and thousands of other individuals in
    1988 are not known. According to existing information, there was no
    official trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who
    were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization named by the leader of
    the Islamic Republic, may have been accused of being “anti-religion” for
    not having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Ghiasvand’s defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves
    in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners
    (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed members of the
    Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic
    Republic, states that such claims “are false considering the circumstances
