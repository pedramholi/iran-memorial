    Mr. Jahangir Jahanbakhsh is one of the victims in the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Additional information about Mr.
    Jahangir Jahanbakhsh is taken from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party
    of Iran by The Tudeh Party Publications. He was born in Tehran, and a
    statistics student at the National University. He was a member of the
    Navid Organization (the underground organization of the Tudeh Party).
    After the "Cultural Revolution" and closing down of the universities, he
    worked as an electrical technician in factories around Tehran. He was in
    charge of communications of Tudeh Party in the Southern and Western
    sections of Tehran. After the Tudeh Party was under attack by the regime,
    he went underground and continued his political activities. The Tudeh
    Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported the former Soviet Union's policies. The
    Party played a major role in Iran's political scene until it was banned
    for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the
    new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party’s
    leaders and members were imprisoned. The Cultural Revolution began after
    Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech in March 1980 and ordered that
    universities be purged of all those who opposed his regime and be
    transformed into “learning environments” [as opposed to political forums]
    where “an all-Islamic curriculum” is taught. The first wave of violence
    began on April 15, 1980 during a speech by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani [a
    member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister of Interior]
    at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech, students supporting the
    regime took control of the University’s central building and demanded that
    the “university be purged” from “pro-Shah elements and other sellouts.” On
    April 18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution issued a communiqué
    accusing political groups of converting higher education institutions into
    “headquarters of discordant political activities” and naming them as
    obstacles to the radical transformation of the universities. The
    communiqué gave these groups three days (Saturday April 19 to Monday April
    21) to shut down their activities in the universities. The Council
    stressed that the decision included libraries along with activities
    related to arts and sports. Political groups, which recruited members and
    had strong support in the universities, refused to evacuate. Before the
    end of the Council’s deadline, serious clashes took place between leftist
    groups and Islamist Associations, in opposition to the Associations,
    sometimes supported by security forces and paramilitary groups. These
    clashes, which peaked at the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in
    the death of several people and the wounding of hundreds of others on
    university campuses around the country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic
    authorities announced the victory of the Cultural Revolution and the
    closure of all universities in order to Islamicize the curricula. The
    universities remained closed for two years. One of the outcomes of the
    Cultural Revolution was the purging of many university professors and
    students based on their political beliefs. Arrest and detention The
    details of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr.
    Jahangir Jahanbakhsh was arrested in 1986. Trial Mr. Jahangir Jahanbakhsh
    was tried and condemned to five years imprisonment. There is no
    information about this trial. Specific details on the circumstances of the
    trials that led to the execution of Mr. Jahanbakhsh and thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney and
    prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executi
