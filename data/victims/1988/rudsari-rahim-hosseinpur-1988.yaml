    The information about Mr. Rahim Hosseinpur Rudsari is based on an
    interview with his sister. He was a victim of the 1988-89 mass execution
    of political prisoners in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The majority of
    the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    Other victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Information about
    the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the
    memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations,
    interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Mr. Rahim
    Hosseinpur Rudsari was born in Rudsar (Gilan province) in 1951. He was a
    teacher and had two children. He was also a history student at Tehran
    University and a sympathizer of the Revolutionary Workers Organization of
    Iran (Rah-e Kargar). He started an underground life from 1981 when his
    political activities were disclosed. “Rah-e Kargar” or the “Revolutionary
    Workers Organization of Iran” was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    had rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action.
    They introduced themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini’s leadership. Arrest and detention The
    details of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. According
    to the interviewee, Mr. Hosseinpur Rudsari was arrested by the
    Revolutionary Guards at a meeting on October 11, 1986, and transferred to
    Evin prison. After his arrest, armed Guards went to his house and arrested
    his wife and children, aged 6 and 12, to Evin prison. They kept his wife
    in the prison two years. She had no visitation with her husband during
    this period. Trial Specific details on the circumstances of the trials
    that led to the execution of the defendant and thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. According to available information, the
    Iranian authorities did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in
    a court with the presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners executed in
    1988 had been questioned by a three-member special committee composed of a
    religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the
    Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about
    their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed at the time they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of
    the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against
    the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization
    named by the leader of the Islamic Republic, may have been accused of
    being “anti-religion” for not having renounced his or her beliefs.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on his defense. In their open letter, the
    families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the
    accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated
    with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes w
