    Mr. Abbas Bestareh is a victim of the mass killings of the political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In addition to the
    Marxist-Leninist groups that opposed the Islamic Republic such as the
    Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) Organization and the Peykar Organization, the
    members of organizations who were not opposed to the Islamic Republic,
    such as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), were also among
    the victims of this mass killing. Additional information about Mr.
    Bestareh is taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001 by The
    Tudeh Party of Iran Publications. He was a literature student at Tehran
    University. He joined the Navid Organization (the Tudeh Party’s secret
    organization) in 1976. After the revolution, he organized workers in
    Shiraz. In 1982, he returned to Tehran to continue his activities with the
    Navid. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh's ideology
    was Marxist-Leninist and it supported the former Soviet Union's policies.
    The Party played a major role on Iran's political scene until it was
    banned following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the
    Tudeh actively support the new government of the Ayatollah Khomeini and
    his Islamic Republic. Although the Tudeh never opposed the Islamic
    Republic, it became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of
    the Party's members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown. Mr.
    Bestareh was arrested in Tehran in May of 1983. During his five years in
    prison, he had limited visits with his family; however, there is no
    information about the dates and details of these visits. Trial There is no
    information about the trial. Also, there is no specific information about
    the circumstances of similar trials that condemned thousands of other
    political prisoners to death in a period of a few months. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been
    tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving or had
    already completed serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No charge has been publicly levelled against this
    defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the victims’ families
    refer to the government’s accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution – as being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the charges
    against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers
    to the Tudeh’s members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and
    "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the
    positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God" and
    should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available about the defendant’s defence. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrilla troops operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived under most difficult
    conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. During the past seven years, we
    witnessed that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed
    them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such
    conditions the families reject the government’s claim that these prisoners
    were able to engage with the political groups outside Iran. It is possible
    that the prisoners who belonged to the organizations other than the MKO
    were convicted for being “anti-religious”, defending their opinion, and
    refusing to repent. Judgment No specific information is available about
    the defendant’s execution. Mr. Bestareh was hanged during the mass killing
    of the political prisoners in September 1988.
