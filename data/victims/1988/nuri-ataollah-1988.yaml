    born in 1964. He lived in Tehran and he had a high school diploma
    (Mojahedin e Khalq Organization of Iran, April 7, 2008). He was single
    (Boroumand Center interview with the sister of one of Mr. Nuri s
    companions, June 3, 2009). Mr. Nuri was a supporter of Mojahedin e Khalq
    Organization. He had spent some time in prison and he was released in
    1986. His brother, Mr. Qodratollah Nuri, had been executed in July 1988.
    His other brother, Mr. Ezzatollah Nuri, also probably tried to join Camp
    Ashraf (Mojahedin e Khalq Organization) in Iraq, in the fall or winter of
    1987 (Boroumand Center interview with the sister of one of Mr. Nuri s
    companions, October 11, 2021; April 2 and June 3, 2009). Mr. Nuri s mother
    was also a supporter of the Mojahedin e Khalq Organization. She visited
    Behesht e Zahra (Tehran Cemetery) often, and she was in contact with
    families of executed members and supporters of the Mojahedin Organization
    (Boroumand Center interview with an acquaintance, October 11, 2021; April
    2 and June 3, 2009; Pezhvak, Spring 2010). The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. (1) Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic
    of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of politically
    motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the 1979
    Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the country
    have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of
    individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of
    the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however,
    these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since then, both
    inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far
    identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agent
