    According to a friend, Mr. Saburi Gargari "was a precious and rare pearl
    in the workers movement of Iran". Information about the life and execution
    of Mr. Zafar (Mohammad) Saburi Gargari, son of Madineh and Abolqasem, has
    been compiled from interviews with two of his close relatives (March 2,
    2022 and May 27, 2022), from two electronic documents sent to by a close
    relative to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (September 7, 2014), and from a
    document sent by one of his cellmates (July 22, 2022). Additional
    information has been collected from the Facebook page of his friend, Mr.
    Mehrdad Darvishpur Payam haye Hambandi (Cellmates Messages) (February 25,
    2022), and from Mr. Saburi Gargari s friends (August 24, 2021). Mr. Saburi
    Gargari was a victim of the mass executions of political prisoners in
    1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has collected additional information about
    these mass executions from The Memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri , Reports of
    Human Rights Organizations, interviews with families, and eyewitness
    accounts. According to available information, Mr. Saburi Gargari was 29,
    born in Tehran (Naziabad neighborhood). He was single, and he had three
    sisters and one brother. He was raised in a family with leftist views. One
    of his cellmates had heard in a private conversation, that he had a wife
    and that he was worried about her. He said, When I asked Mohammad why he
    couldn t ask his family members about his wife, during visiting time, he
    said she was a foreigner. He meant she was not an Iranian citizen.
    (February 25, 2022). In an interview with one of Mr. Saburi Gargari s
    relatives, he said that by foreigner , Mohammad might have meant that his
    wife was a fighter abroad, who had come to Iran after the revolution. When
    he was eighteen, he worked at the Family Welfare Center in Tehran s
    Naziabad neighborhood. He was a member of the Newsletter Publication Group
    at this center. He participated in demonstrations against the Shah. Even
    then, he did not like to participate in public political activity and his
    activities were covert. His political activity at that time included
    distributing nightly pamphlets and analytical booklets about the worker
    strikes in Abadan Refinery, and getting these to friends and other
    political activists. According to his friend and coworker at the time, I
    found Mohammad to be very sincere, kind, organized, selfless, genteel,
    calm, lively, good tempered, well spoken, and intellectual. (Mehrdad
    Darvishpur). Another friend described him as A precious and rare pearl in
    the workers movement of Iran. Mr. Saburi Gargari had become familiar with
    members of the Freedom Fighters of the Working Class*. After he got his
    high school diploma, he started his professional political-revolutionary
    career, and he organized the Tehran branch of the Mottahedin Khalq. He
    became a member of the central committee of this organization and he
    became responsible for the Tehran branch. This group was active in the
    strikes at Ahvaz Steel and at the Abadan Oil Refinery, before the
    revolution of 1979. Mr. Saburi Gargari was strongly opposed to current
    attitudes of that time, such as guerilla methods and Tudeh Party. He
    believed in activity within the working class. He was so committed to
    keeping his political life a secret that part of his family knew nothing
    about his political activities. Before he was arrested, Mr. Saburi Gargari
    was one of the youngest leaders in the Revolutionary Struggle for the
    Freedom of the Working Class Organization. The publication of this
    organization was Combat (One of his friends). Up to his arrest, he led a
    public and a secret life. Arrest and detention According to available
    information, Mr. Saburi Gargari was identified by someone (a repentant
    informer) with the Revolutionary Guards patrol and arrested at 3 pm on
    June 10, 1983. At the time, he was strolling on Vali Asr Street in Tehran,
    with a relative who had recently become a supporter of his organization.
    The person who identified him knew he was a political activist but did not
    know which group he was affiliated with (Electronic document from
    cellmate). They took him and his companion (who was released after a few
    weeks) to Evin Prison, Section 209. In prison, for a while, he was
    claiming to be a taxi driver. According to his cellmate, In any case,
    Mohammad went to Evin 209 and he was tortured a lot. He did not divulge
    any information and he said he was a taxi driver. Eventually, he was
    identified as a member of his organization by one of the prisoners (a
    repentant informer), and he was interrogated again. After this, Mohammad
    abandoned his initial false identity and became one of the l
