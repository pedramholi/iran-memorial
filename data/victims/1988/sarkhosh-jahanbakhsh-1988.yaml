    Mr. Jahanbakhsh Sarkhosh s execution was reported to Omid via two
    electronic forms by individuals familiar with his case. Mr. Sarkhosh was
    also mentioned in the BBC Persian website in a narrative by one of his
    cellmates at the Gohardasht Prison, Mr. Mehdi Aslani, on August 27, 2004.
    Mr. Sarkhosh is one of the victims of the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The majority of the
    executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other
    victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Information about
    the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the
    memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations,
    interviews with victims families, and witnesses memoirs. Based on the
    available information, Mr. Sarkhosh was a member of the People s Fedayian
    of Iran Organization (minority). His father, a police officer, was killed
    in an armed struggle with drug smugglers when he was young. His mother
    raised her four children as a single parent with pension of her husband
    and worked in people s houses as a cleaner. At age sixteen (1968), Mr.
    Sarkhosh passed the entrance exam to the military industrial vocational
    school and enrolled in the boarding school, which provided an allowance to
    students. He wanted to help his mother with the expenses of raising his
    siblings. He married a schoolteacher a few years before the 1979
    Revolution and had a son. He worked as a technician at the Military
    ammunition factory in Tehran until a few months before his arrest. The
    sender of an electronic form remembers Mr. Sarkhosh as very athletic and a
    good soccer player. He played for the school s soccer team. He was also
    very quiet. He spoke very little, but at the same time he was very nice,
    popular and funny. He did not smoke or drink but was tolerant of those who
    did. Mr. Sarkhosh had two brothers (Mohsen and Hassan), both of whom were
    executed in 1981. The sender of an electronic form quoted a witness
    saying: When Jahan s two brothers were executed, Jahan himself washed
    their bodies in [the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in Tehran]. Jahan told me
    that their faces, jaws, and teeth had been shattered by the bullets. Jahan
    s mother was screaming [as if wounded], unlike anything I had ever seen,
    and was saying: How could you do this to me? I raised these kids by doing
    people s laundry. How could you do this to me? I hope you all burn in
    hell. I hope your Imam burns in hell. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was mainly active in the
    political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention According to
    the form, Mr. Sarkhosh was arrested in 1980 in Tehran and detained at Evin
    and Qezelhesar Prisons and later at Gohardasht Prison. According to Mr.
    Aslani s narrative, Mr. Sarkhosh was held at the Section 8 of the Prison.
    Trial Mr. Sarkhosh was first tried and condemned to 8 years imprisonment.
    At the time of executed had had completed 7 years and 4 months of this
    term. He was retried in 1988. According to existing information, there was
    no official trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those
    who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of
    a religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The circumstances of this trial are mentioned in Mr. Aslani s
    narrative: One day several guards whom we did not recognize entered our
    section. They had their heads shaved and were carrying cables. They were
    special guards that could enter the prison at any time and were privy to
    enter privileged areas such as the amphitheater and the Hosseinieh [a
    large room at the prison for taping confessions and performing prayers] at
    Gohardasht. Executions were held at these rooms and to keep these
    executions quiet the gallows were already set up. They blindfolded the
    prisoners in section 8 and with the excuse of searching them took them out
    to the hallway. One by one we were taken to a room. Inside the room were
    the head of the prison, the head of the internal affairs of the prison and
    a guard. We were asked several questions including, Do you believe in your
    organization? Are you willing to give a taped confession in front of the
    other prisoners? Most answered no to
