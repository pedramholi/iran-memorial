    Mr. Firuz Hamjavar is one of the victims in the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs.
    The information about Mr. Firuz Hamjavar is taken from the book The
    Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party Publications. He was
    born in Maku in 1945. He was a chemical engineer and served as Deputy
    Chief of the Tehran Petroleum Company. He joined the Tudeh Party just a
    few months before his arrest. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941.
    The Tudeh ideology was Marxist -Leninist and it supported the policies of
    the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran’s political
    scene until it was banned for the second time following the August 19,
    1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah
    Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party leaders and members were
    imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Firuz Hamjavar was arrested in
    1983. He was held at both Evin and Gohardasht prisons. Trial Mr. Firuz
    Hamjavar was tried and condemned to three years imprisonment in 1984.
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Hamjavar and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are
    not known. According to existing information, there was no official trial
    with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed
    in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious
    judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public
    Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some
    questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in God. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges The charge against Mr. Firuz Hamjavar was
    probably his connection to the Tudeh Party. The above book quotes the
    religious judge charging the defendant as "being single at such an age."
    No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass
    executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners –
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as
    well as being “associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Mojahedin
    Organization, may have been accused of being “anti-religion” for not
    having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants
    were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same
    letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the
    prison) had collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization
    in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such
    claims “are false considering the circumstances in prisons; for our
    children faced most difficult conditions [in the prison, with] visitation
    rights of once every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes throu
