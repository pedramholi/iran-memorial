    News and information regarding the execution of Mr. Mohammad Sa id
    Azarang, son of Tahereh and Gholam Hossein, was sent electronically to
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center by his friends on both June 15, 2016 and
    April 18, 2019. Additional information was obtained from ABC s interview
    with a person close to Mr. Azarang on June 17, 2019. News of this
    execution was also published on the website of the Tudeh Party of Iran and
    Bidaran on December 2, 2013. Mr. Azarang was a victim of the mass killings
    of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners
    were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims
    families, and witnesses memoirs. Mr. Azarang was born in Kermanshah native
    and an alumnus of Tehran's Kharazmi University (formerly Tarbiat Mo alem
    University), studying chemistry. He had a two-year tenure as Executive
    Director of a cardboard factory in the city of Tehran where he resided.
    Sources at hand describe Mr. Azarang as an outstanding student throughout
    his high school and university years. During the Shah's rule he was in
    contact with left-leaning university research groups, and along with his
    friends was a contributor to the publication Akhgar. In this time period,
    he was arrested twice and spent three and a half years behind bars. After
    being released from prison in 1977, he married one of his friends and
    party associates, and they had one son. After being released from prison,
    Azarang was active in Navid, an underground branch of the Tudeh Party of
    Iran* that continued to operate covertly after the 1979 Revolution.
    Azarang was a high-ranking agent for Navid and was later elected to serve
    on the Tudeh Party's* central Advisory Committee. Arrest and detention In
    the evening of April 27, 1983, armed plain clothes intelligence agents of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) went to Mr. Azarang's home in
    Taleqani street where they took him into custody and transported to Evin
    Prison along with his wife, their two-year-old son, and one of Mr. Azarang
    s Navid associates who had been staying there. The IRGC agents, between 20
    and 30 in number, had blocked off the area surrounding Mr. Azarang's home
    before storming inside. Once they were in, the agents knew exactly where
    to look; someone had leaked in advance where his [political literature]
    was stashed. (e-correspondence April 18, 2019) The agents confiscated Mr.
    Azarang family's belongings, which included a car, a camera, and a number
    of valuables. (e-correspondence April 18, 2019) Mr. Azarang was tortured
    during his interrogations; sources close to him say that it was a "brutal
    and deadly torture. Using shackles and lashings to the point of ripping
    flesh to the bone in some spots. The agents wanted him to publicly repent
    and confess to espionnage on popular television shows. They tortured him
    so badly that he was on the verge of death, slipping in and out of
    consciousness." (Interview June 17, 2019). Azarang was also subjected to
    three years of solitary confinement in Evin Prison. The rest of Mr.
    Azarang's family got news of his arrest through his neighbors. Once they
    did, they circulated among different prisons [attempting to find him].
    While Prison officials initially feigned ignorance about his whereabouts,
    his mother, who kept following up, was eventually told by an IRGC member
    guarding Evin that she was wasting her time. "Everyone here's a traitor or
    a spy, and we execute them." Security agents were sometimes extremely
    cruel and insulting in their exchanges with the families of political
    prisoners, in some cases even compelling milder-mannered personnel to step
    forward and help the prisoners mothers. (Interview June 17, 2019) The
    families of the 88 mass execution victims were never given a notice for
    visits. Families had to spend days in front of Evin Prison. Family members
    were successful maybe 10 percent of the time in making headway with
    requests for a visit with their loved one. Mr. Azarang s mother spent a
    year making unsuccessful return trips to the prison, where she was
    insulted and treated with contempt, before finally obtaining a visit with
    him. During Mr. Azarang s five-year sentence, his parents were only once
    able to sit in close company with their son. His sisters had a meeting
    with him in person; once, prison officials allowed his wife to do the
    same. The rest of Mr. Azarang s contacts with visitors during this period
    were over the phone or through glass. (Interview June 17, 2019) Throughout
    Mr. Azarang's prison term, the comings and goings of his family, as well
    as his contacts
