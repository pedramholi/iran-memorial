    The information about Mr. Ali Reza Kiani, son of Hedayatollah, has been
    drawn from an interview with a relative. His name is also mentioned in the
    book Those Who Said No , published in 1999 by the Paris-based Association
    for the Defense of Political Prisoners and Prisoners of Conscience in
    Iran. Mr. Kiani was a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization
    (Majority) and a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in
    1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims families, and witnesses memoirs.
    Mr. Kiani held a bachelor s degree in chemistry and worked at the Tehran
    Oil Refinery Company, in which he led political activities of the
    employees. He was a prominent and well-known political activist among
    employees of the Company as well as among political prisoners before and
    after the revolution of 1979. Mr. Kiani was arrested in 1981 and freed
    after some time, without being tried. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Majority considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and
    anti-imperialist regime and supported it. After the spring of 1983,
    however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely because of their
    political beliefs. Arrest and detention Agents of the Ministery of
    Intelligence arrested Mr. Kiani in September 1985 in Zahedan, from where
    he intended to flee the country. He was detained in Zahedan for some time
    and then transferred to the Joint Committee. After the Revolution of 1979,
    the Joint Anti-Sabotage Committee was renamed to 3000 Ward and
    subsequently to Tohid Prison. Before and after the revolution, political
    prisoners were tortured in this infamous prison, which has become the
    Ebrat Museum since the early 1990 s. Trial Mr. Kiani was tried in April
    1986 and condemned to three years imprisonment. Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Kiani and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with the presence of an
    attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This
    committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs
    and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges According to the interviewee, in his first trial, Mr. Kiani
    was charged with refusing to denounce his political organization. No
    charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass
    executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as
    well as being associated with military action or with various [opposition]
    groups based near the borders. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic
    Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims
    regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict,
    Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    as hypocrites who do not believe in Islam and wage war against God and
    decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this
    organization are also waging war against God and should be sentenced to
    death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization named by the
