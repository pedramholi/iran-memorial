    Mr. Bahram Danesh is one of the victims in the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In addition to members of other
    Marxist-Leninist organizations opposed to the Islamic Republic such as the
    Fadayian Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, activists of
    organizations such as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority)
    that were not against the Islamic Republic, were also among the victims of
    this mass killings. Additional information about Mr. Danesh is taken from
    the book The Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001 by The Tudeh Party of Iran
    publications. He was born in Kermanshah. He graduated from the Military
    College. His high school years were spent in Beirut (Lebanon) and the city
    of Mashad in the province of Khorasan, Iran. In 1944 he joined the Tudeh
    Party.After his graduation from the Military College, he served in the
    Eastern Army in Mashad and then worked as an instructor in the Military
    College in Tehran. Two years later, when he was in danger of being
    arrested, he moved to Azarbaijan and cooperated with the Democrat Party.
    (In that year, Azarbaijan province was occupied by the Red Army and was
    declared an independent state.) In December, 1946, when the Democrat Party
    was defeated, he escaped from the country and continued his education,
    studying Philosophy and French. After the Revolution, he returned to Iran
    to continue his political activities as a member of the Central Committee
    of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The
    Tudeh's ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the
    former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran's political
    scene until it was banned for the second time following the August 19,
    1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh Party declared the
    Ayatollah Khomeini and his Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of its
    attacks from 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members were
    imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Danesh was arrested by the
    Revolutionary Guards on April 27, 1983. Trial Mr. Danesh was tried and
    condemned to life imprisonment. There is no information about the trial.
    Also, there is no specific information about the circumstances of such
    trials that condemned this defendant and thousands of other political
    prisoners to death in a few months period. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argued that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They noted that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners
    had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either
    serving or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was publicly levelled against the
    defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners –
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants
    were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla troops operating
    near the borders, the families said the isolation of their relatives from
    the outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed, over the past seven
    years, that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed
    them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such
    conditions the families reject the claim of the authorit
