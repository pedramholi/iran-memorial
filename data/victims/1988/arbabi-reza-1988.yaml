    Information about Mr. Reza Arbabi was gathered from an electronic form
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a relative. According to this e-form,
    Mr. Arbabi was born in Mashhad, was married, and had two little children.
    Mr. Reza Arbabi is also listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were reported by the
    organization in a book titled Crime Against Humanity . This book documents
    the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri; reports from the human
    rights organizations; interviews with the witnesses and victims families,
    as well as the Bidaran website. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adopted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary, and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders.* Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Arbabi's arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on Mr. Reza Arbabi s trial. According to the testimonies of
    some of the political prisoners who were tried during the executions of
    the summer of 1988 in Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the trials took place
    in a room on the ground floor of the prison after a few weeks of
    isolation, during which prisoners were deprived of visitation, television
    and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and September, a
    three-member delegation composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor;
    Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge; and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi,
    the representative of the Ministry of Information, asked prisoners
    questions about their views on the Mojahedin, whether they would renounce
    their beliefs, and if they were ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin.
    Based on what the answers were, the prisoners would have been charged with
    counter revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam or associated with
    military action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders
    and would be sentenced to death. The authorities never informed prisoners
    about the delegation s purpose and the serious implications of their
    responses. According to survivors, during the summer of 1988, a large
    number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were
    executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then-Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly leveled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners; accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charge
