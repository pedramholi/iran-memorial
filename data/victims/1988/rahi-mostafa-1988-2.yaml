    Compassionate, kind, and influential among his companions, his politics
    emerged from broad study and a strong sensitivity to injustice. The
    information about Mr. Mostafa Rahi was sent to Omid, via an electronic
    form from a relative. He is also among 3,208 members and sympathizers of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization whose execution was reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book
    documents the 1988-1989 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additionally, Mr. Rahi is mentioned in a UN Human Rights Commission s
    Special Representative s Report, Names and particulars of persons
    allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the period
    July-December 1988, published January 26, 1989. The latter report
    specifies that although 1,000 names are mentioned, in all probability
    there were several thousand victims. Most of the alleged victims were
    members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People s
    Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims. Mr. Rahi, son of Qorban
    Ali and Soraya, was born in Tehran on June 28, 1962. He was an outstanding
    student at Karim Zand High School in Tehran, and majored in mathematics. A
    relative of Mr. Rahi remembers that, although he did not live long, he
    greatly influenced those around him. The entire family, regardless of
    their thinking, remembers him as someone wise and of good morals. He was
    very sensitive to injustice He was extremely kind and compassionate. Mr.
    Rahi graduated from high school in 1980 or 1981. Mr. Rahi began his
    political activism during the revolution, and he was a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. According to the relative who wrote to Omid
    through an electronic form, he participated in demonstrations against the
    monarchy and read political, religious, and philosophical books, as well
    as the Mojahed magazine. He was well-known for his political activism.
    Based on the information in the electronic form, state agents went to the
    Rahi family s house a few times and searched the property. In 1981, Mr.
    Rahi was first arrested at age 19 for being a Hypocrite, the term Iranian
    officials used to refer to those affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. While incarcerated, he had several visits with his family.
    During the visits, which took place behind glass dividers and through a
    telephone, his family members witnessed that he had lost weight and
    limped. They believe that we could not walk because he was tortured on the
    soles of his feat, a form of punishment called bastinado. Mr. Rahi was
    tried behind closed doors and condemned to 6 months imprisonment. He was
    released in 1982. Arrest and detention Mr. Rahi was re-arrested in Tehran
    in 1984 and transferred to Evin prison. His family visited him in prison.
    His relative states that, he was in good spirits but looked very skinny.
    It was obvious that he had been tortured. During one visit, his feet were
    bandaged. Trial Mr. Rahi was tried in 1985. There is no available
    information about the court verdict. Specific details about the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Rahi and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with attorneys or
    prosecutors. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they
    argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of
    their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly stated against the
    victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of
    Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in
    February 2003, the families of the victims refer to the authorities
    accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as hypocrites who do not
    believe in Islam and wage war against God and de
