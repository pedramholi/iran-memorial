    Information about Mr. Mas ud Keshavarz, son of Hadi, was gathered from an
    electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with
    this case. According to this information, he was born in Larsar, Some
    ehsara in 1959. He was single, a high school graduate in electronics, anda
    businessman. Mr. Mas ud Keshavarz is also listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information regarding
    the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from
    the Human Rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims
    families as well as from the Bidaran website. * The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to a split within the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in
    1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were
    released along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize
    the MKO and to recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the
    1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO
    accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. ** Arrest and Detention Mr. Mas ud Keshavarz was arrested at
    Seydkhandan Bridge in Tehran for the first time in 1980. He was condemned
    to four years imprisonment. He was arrested again at Naserkhosro Street in
    Tehran. He was detained at Gohardasht, Qezelhesar, and Evin prisons. No
    specific information is available on Mr. Mas ud Keshavarz's arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on Mr. Mas ud Keshavarz s
    trial. According to the testimonies of some of the political prisoners who
    were tried during the executions of the summer of 1988 in Gohardasht and
    Evin prisons, the trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the
    prison after a few weeks of isolation during which prisoners were deprived
    of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In
    August and September, a three-member delegation composed of Hojatoleslam
    Eshraqi, the prosecutor: Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge: and
    Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry of
    Information, asked prisoners questions about their views on the Mojahedin,
    whether they would renounce their beliefs, and if they were ready to
    cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the
    prisoners would have been charged with counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion and anti-Islam or associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders and would be sentenced
    to death. The authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s
    purpose and the serious implications of their responses. During the summer
    of 1998, according to survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing
    with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their
    beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then-Minister of Justice,
    Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges The charge against Mr. Mas ud
    Keshavarz was announced as, Acting against state s security. No charge has
    been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In
    their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988) and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners a
