    The information about Mr. Akbar Sadeqi-Bonab, son of Hashem, was gathered
    from two electronic forms sent to the Boroumand Foundation by persons
    familiar with this case. According to this information, Mr. Akbar
    Sadeqi-Bonab was born in Tabriz in 1952. He was married and an agriculture
    student whose education was incomplete due to an arrest by SAVAK in 1973.
    During the previous regime, he was imprisoned for five years. He was a
    sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization-Majority. Mr. Akbar
    Sadeqi-Bonab is also cited in the list Yadnameh , published by the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, Majority Branch (April 2002: Koln). He was a
    victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from the Human
    Rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families
    as well as Bidaran website. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. After the 1979 Revolution, the
    organization, which renounced armed struggle, split over their support of
    the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority
    supported and considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and
    anti-imperialist regime. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic
    Republic targeted its members solely because of their political beliefs.
    Arrest and detention According to the information sent via an electronic
    form, Mr. Akbar Sadeqi-Bonab was arrested in Tehran and taken to Evin
    prison in 1982.. He had no access to an attorney and authorities informed
    his family by phone only six months after his arrest. There is no further
    information on his arrest and detention. Trial According to the
    information sent via an electronic form, the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    condemned Mr. Akbar Sadeqi-Bonab to six years imprisonment. Specific
    details about the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of
    Mr. Akbar Sadeqi-Bonab are unknown. According to the testimonies of
    leftist political prisoners who were tried in Gohardasht Prison during the
    executions of the summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room on the
    ground floor of the prison after a few weeks of isolation during which
    prisoners were deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts,
    and outdoor time. Toward the end of August, a three-member delegation
    composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor, Hojatoleslam Nayyeri,
    the religious judge, and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of
    the Ministry of Information, asked prisoners questions about whether they
    were Muslim or Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were
    practicing Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the latter were
    sentenced to be hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The
    authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and
    the serious implications of their responses. According to survivors,
    during the summer of 1988 a large number of prisoners sympathizing with
    the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their
    beliefs. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to Minister of Justice at the
    time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly stated
    against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. Based on the testimonies
    of the prisoners who were in prisons in the summer of 1988, the questions
    of the three-member committee from the leftist prisoners were about their
    beliefs and they were accused of being anti-religion , insisting on their
    beliefs and not repenting. In their letters to the Minister of Justice in
    1988, and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against the
    prisoners accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An edict of the
