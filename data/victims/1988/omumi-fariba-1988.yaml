    Ms. Fariba Omumi is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity.
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was found on the Bidaran and the People's Mojahedin
    of Iran Organization websites. According to the Mojahedin website, Ms.
    Fariba Omumi was born in Esfahan. She was a student at Tehran University
    and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Organization. Her sister, Mansureh, was
    tortured and killed while in Esfahan prison in September 1981. Arrest and
    detention There is no specific information on the defendant s arrest and
    detention. Ms. Fariba Omumi was arrested in 1981 and detained for seven
    years. She spent some time in solitary confinement and once was placed in
    the prison s infirmary. Trial Ms. Fariba Omumi was tried and convicted in
    two courts. There is no specific information about these trials. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had already been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had completed serving at the time they were retried
    and sentenced to death. Charges No charge was publicly leveled against the
    defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available about the defendant s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrillas operating near the borders, the
    families refer to the isolation of their relatives from the outside during
    their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits
    were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider via telephone every two
    weeks. During the past seven years, we witnessed that they were denied
    access to anything that would have allowed them to establish contacts
    outside their prisons' walls." Therefore, the families reject the
    authorities claim that these prisoners were able to engage with the
    political groups outside Iran. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the defendant s execution. Ms. Fariba Omumi was condemned
    to 15 years imprisonment in her first trial and to 17 years in her second
    trial. But, she was executed at the Evin prison on December 13, 1988.
    According to the Mojahedin website, her body was taken to the coroner s
    office after her execution, and the officials asked her mother to identify
    her body.
