    He had a high school diploma in mathematics and he was going to marry his
    fianc . He was arrested when he was 19 years old. Information on the
    execution of Mr. Abdoljabar Shabani, son of Ali and Kokab, was collected
    from an interview conducted by Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with his
    comrade and fianc (January 9, 2024). Mr. Shabani s name is included in a
    list of 3208 members and supporters of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of
    Iran in a book titled Crime Against Humanity * and also in the book
    Neither Living Nor Dying by Iraj Mesdaghi (2006). His name also appears in
    the list of 1000 people executed, in the report of the United Nations
    Special Representative (January 26, 1989) about the state of Human Rights
    in Iran. Mr. Shabani is a victim of the mass killing of political
    prisoners in 1988. Most of the executed prisoners were members and
    supporters of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran. Other victims of
    this killing included Marxist Leninist groups in opposition to the Islamic
    Republic, such as the Fedayeen Organization (minority), and Peikār
    Organization, and also supporters of parties such as Tudeh Party and
    Fedayeen (majority) who were not actively opposing the Islamic Republic.
    Boroumand Center has collected additional information about this mass
    killing from the recollections of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of Human
    Rights Organizations, interviews with families, and recollections of
    witnesses. Mr. Shabani was single and he had a high school diploma in
    mathematics and physics. He had a fianc and they were going to get married
    (Center Interview, January 9, 2024). Mr. Shabani was a supporter of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization and he continued to serve in the military
    branch of this organization starting in June 20, 1981. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime (1919-1980). They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    reorganize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    Leaders.** Arrest and detention Mr. Shabani was arrested in Tehran in
    1981, when he was 19 years old. He was incarcerated in Gohardasht Prison
    until the winter of 1988. Trial Mr. Shabani was tried one time, and he was
    sentenced to 18 years in prison. No information is available on Mr.
    Shabani s trial. There is no clear information about the circumstances nor
    the manner of these executions. Families of the victims of the 1988
    killings have strongly objected to the unjust and illegal trials that
    resulted in the execution of thousands of prisoners in a few days. In
    1988, they sent a letter to the Minister of Justice at the time, Hasan
    Habibi. In it, they questioned the official policy of secrecy about these
    executions and they deemed it proof of the illegality of the whole
    operation. They reiterated that nearly all of the victims were prisoners
    that had received prison sentences in Shari a courts and that they were
    either serving their sentences or completing their sentences. These
    prisoners had been retried and had quickly been sentenced to death.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Shabani is not known. The judicial
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have not formally charged the victims
    of the mass executions of 1988. The families of the victims have written a
    letter to the Minister of Justice. They also wrote a letter to the United
    Nations Special Rapporteur who traveled to Iran in 2002. In these letters
    they have pointed to charges such as opposing the revolution, opposing
    religion, and opposing Islam , or attribution of military activities in
    border areas to the victims as being the supposed basis for the conviction
