    Mr. Vali Bahramian (Bahrami) is listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose
    execution was reported by the Organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity . This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran
    website and the PMIO website. He was born in Tabriz. He was a worker and a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. There is no information about the exact date of arrest for Mr.
    Vali Bahramian. He was detained in the Tabriz prison. According to the MKO
    website, he and his family were constantly anxious about his execution.
    Trial Mr. Vali Bahramian was tried and condemned to "suspended execution."
    There is no information about the trial, just as there is no specific
    information about any such trials that condemned thousands of political
    prisoners to death in the span of a few months. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly levelled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the accusations against the prisoners that may have
    led to their execution. These include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict from the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs
    of his designated successor Ayatollah Montazeri corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMIO's members as "hypocrites" who
    do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to death. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available about
    the defendant’s defence. In their open letter, the families of the
    prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend
    themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated
    with guerrilla forces operating near the borders, the families submit the
    isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our
    children lived under most difficult conditions. Our visits were limited to
    10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We
    witnessed over seven years that they were denied access to anything that
    would have allowed them to establish contacts outside their prison walls."
    Under such conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities
    that these prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside
    Iran. Judgment No specific information is available about the defendant’s
    execution. According to the MKO website, Mr. Vali Bahramian was hanged
    during the mass killings of the political prisoners in Tabriz in September
    1988.
