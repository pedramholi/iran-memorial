    Information about Mr. Mohammad Daryabari, son of Qanbar, was gathered from
    an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar
    with this case. Mr. Mohammad Daryabari is also cited in the list Yadnameh,
    published by the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, Majority Branch (April 2002:
    Koln). He was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in
    1988. The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information,
    regarding the 1988 massacre, from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri,
    reports from human rights organizations, interviews with witnesses and
    victims families, as well as from the Bidaran website. Mr. Daryabari, is
    one of 1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission's Special
    Representative's Report, "Names and particulars of persons allegedly
    executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the period July-December
    1988," published on January 26, 1989. The report specifies that although
    1000 names are mentioned, "in all probability" there were several thousand
    victims. "Most of the alleged victims were members of the Mojahedin.
    However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe
    Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among
    the alleged victims." In addition, Mr. Daryabari is among 3208 members
    whose execution was reported by the Mojahedin Khalwq organization in a
    book entitled Crime Against Humanity. This book documents the 1988-89 mass
    execution of political prisoners. The majority of the executed prisoners
    in 1988 were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims
    included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such
    as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which
    opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan
    Khalq (Majority), which did not. Mr. Mohammad Daryabari was born in Tehran
    in 1948. He was married with three children. He was an employee in the
    Veterinarian Office. During the previous regime, he was imprisoned in 1973
    and 1974. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist-Leninist group,
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin
    America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. After the 1979 Revolution, the organization, which
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority supported and
    considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist
    regime. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted
    its members solely because of their political beliefs. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Mohammad Daryabari was arrested at his residence on May 7,
    1985, at 10:30 p.m. He was transferred to the Evin prison. There is no
    specific information on his arrest and detention. Trial Specific details
    about the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr.
    Mohammad Daryabari are unknown. According to the testimonies of leftist
    political prisoners who were tried in Gohardasht Prison during the
    executions of the summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room on the
    ground floor of the prison after a few weeks of isolation during which
    prisoners were deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts,
    and outdoor time. Toward the end of August, a three-member delegation,
    composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri,
    the religious judge; and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of
    the Ministry of Information; asked prisoners questions about whether they
    were Muslim or Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were
    practicing Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the latter were
    sentenced to be hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The
    authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and
    the serious implications of their responses. According to survivors,
    during the summer of 1988 a large number of prisoners sympathizing with
    the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their
    beliefs. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to the Minister of Justice at
    the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding
    these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an
    overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to
    prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed when
    they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly stated against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. Based on
    the testimonies of the inmates, who were in prisons in the summer of 1988,
    the questions of the three-member committee from the leftist prisoners
    were about their beliefs and they were accused of being anti-religion,
    insisting on their beliefs and not repenting. In the
