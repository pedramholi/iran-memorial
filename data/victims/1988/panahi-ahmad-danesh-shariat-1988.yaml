quotes:
  - "On April 27, at dawn, several armed young men attacked my house. After they created fear and intimidation for my wife and two daughters and messed up the house, they blindfolded me and took me away. I was beaten up many times in prison for being falsely accused of touching my blindfold, even when I was asleep. I was denied any contact with anyone outside or my family. I had no visitation for over a year and a half. My phone contact was discontinued, and my family had no news of me for several months. Then, I was allowed to call my family for only a few minutes, blindfolded and under the supervision of a guard, every fortnight or sometimes every month. I received the worst political and honor defamation and spent two and a half years in solitary confinement or even worse conditions."
  - "They took me to a room, where a young cleric sat behind a desk. He asked me the same questions that my interrogator had asked. He asked me if I still believed in my beliefs. Later, I realized that this session, which did not take more than a few minutes, was my trial."

    Information about Mr. Ahmad Danesh-Shari atpanahi was gathered from an
    electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with
    this case. Further information on Mr. Ahmad Danesh-Shari atpanahi, an
    affiliate of the Tudeh Party, is also taken from the book Those Who Said
    No , published in 1999 in Paris by the Association for the Defense of
    Political Prisoners and Prisoners of Conscience in Iran. He was a victim
    of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri; reports from Human
    Rights organizations; and interviews with witnesses and victims families,
    as well as from the Bidaran website. The majority of the executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims
    included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such
    as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which
    opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan
    Khalq (Majority), which did not. Mr. Ahmad Danesh-Shari atpanahi was born
    in Bam in 1933. He went to Germany to continue his education in 1951 and
    became a urologist. He was also politically active and returned to Iran by
    an advice from the Tudeh Party in 1972. He was a member of the Central
    Committee of the party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The
    Tudeh's ideology was Marxist-Leninist, and it supported the former Soviet
    Union s policies. The Party played a major role in Iran's political scene,
    until it was banned for a second time following the August 19, 1953, coup.
    After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the
    Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively
    supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic
    Republic, it became the target of its attacks, beginning in 1982, when
    most of the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Ahmad Danesh-Shari atpanahi was arrested at his residence on
    April 27, 1983. In an open letter to Ayatollah Montazeri from Evin Prison,
    in 1987, he wrote about the bad condtions of the prisoners and the way
    they were treated and how some prisoners were kept longer than their
    sentence, in order to force them to interview [in favor of the regime]. He
    also wrote about his own arrest and prison conditions: On April 27, at
    dawn, several armed young men attacked my house. After they created fear
    and intimidation for my wife and two daughters and messed up the house,
    they blindfolded me and took me away. I was beaten up many times in prison
    for being falsely accused of touching my blindfold, even when I was
    asleep. I was denied any contact with anyone outside or my family. I had
    no visitation for over a year and a half. My phone contact was
    discontinued, and my family had no news of me for several months. Then, I
    was allowed to call my family for only a few minutes, blindfolded and
    under the supervision of a guard, every fortnight or sometimes every
    month. I received the worst political and honor defamation and spent two
    and a half years in solitary confinement or even worse conditions. Trial
    In his open letter to Ayatollah Montazeri, Mr. Ahmad Danesh-Shari atpanahi
    wrote about his trial after two years imprisonment: They took me to a
    room, where a young cleric sat behind a desk. He asked me the same
    questions that my interrogator had asked. He asked me if I still believed
    in my beliefs. Later, I realized that this session, which did not take
    more than a few minutes, was my trial. Specific details about the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Ahmad
    Danesh-Shari atpanahi are unknown. No information is available about the
    trial sessions. According to the testimonies of leftist political
    prisoners who were tried in Gohardasht Prison during the executions of the
    summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the
    prison after a few weeks of isolation during which prisoners were deprived
    of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. Toward
    the end of August, a three-member delegation, composed of Hojatoleslam
    Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge; and
    Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry of
    Information, asked prisoners questions about whether they were Muslim or
    Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were practicing
    Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the latter were sentenced to be
    hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The authorities never
    informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious
    implications of their responses. According to survivors during the summer
    of 1988, a large number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or
    Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality
