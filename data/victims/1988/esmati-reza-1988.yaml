    Information about Mr. Reza Esmati is taken from an interview with a person
    close to him. Additional information has been taken from the Bidaran
    website. Mr. Esmati was a victim of the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    of human rights organizations, interviews with victims families, and
    witnesses memoirs. Mr. Reza Esmati was a graduate of the National
    University, with a degree in sociology. He was married and had a son. He
    was a political activist during the previous regime and was condemned to 3
    years imprisonment in 1974. After his release, he worked in a company in
    Bushehr as an accountant until 1979. After the revolution, he started his
    political activity in Tehran with a small group of sympathizers of Komeleh
    (a leftist organization in Kordestan that engaged in an armed struggle
    against the Islamic Republic). Arrest and detention Mr. Esmati was
    arrested, along with two other members of his organization, in his
    residence in Tehran on September 8, 1981. The Revolutionary Guards
    surrounded his house and two plain clothed agents entered the house. They
    did not have an arrest warrant but stated the reason for his arrest as
    "answering some questions at the station (revolutionary guards
    headquarters)." Mr. Esmati was taken to the Evin prison, section 209,
    where he was interrogated. He was denied the right to have an attorney.
    His first visitation with his wife and parents took place five months
    after his arrest following which he had bi-weekly or monthly visitations.
    According to his relatives, he was tortured severely in order to disclose
    the identity of other members of the group. Trial Mr. Esmati s first trial
    was held at Evin three months after his arrest. He had no access to his
    file and was denied the right to have an attorney. He was condemned to
    death in this trial. Then, a second trial issued the final ruling and
    condemned him to 20 years imprisonment. The location and date of this
    trial is not known. Moreover, it is not known if this trial was an appeal
    court or not. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Esmati and thousands of other individuals in 1988
    are not known. According to existing information, there was no official
    trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were
    executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges In his first and second trials,
    Mr. Esmati was charged with connection to "the anti-revolutionary group of
    Komeleh." No charge has been publicly levelled against the victims of the
    1988 mass execution. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988),
    and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the
    prisoners accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war
    against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, may have been accused of being "anti-religion" for not
    having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The repor
