    Ms. Ma sumeh (Shurangiz) Karimian is among the 3208 members and
    sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was drawn from the following sources: 1) An Omid
    Memorial electronic form filled in by one of Ms. Karimian s former fellow
    inmates 2) The Bidaran website and the writings of Ms. Karimian s former
    fellow inmate, Mina Entezari 3) An Omid Memorial electronic form filled in
    by one of Ms. Karimian s acquaintances regarding her detention Ms.
    Karimian was an orthopedics specialist physician educated in England and a
    sympathizer of the MKO. One of her fellow inmates writes about her: She
    was respected by all in the ward. The younger inmates relied on her and
    she was a medical consultant to those suffering from joint and bone pains.
    She taught massage techniques to those who wished to learn them and
    physiotherapy techniques to those who needed them. Arrest and detention
    According to one of Ms. Karimian s acquaintances, she and her sister,
    Zahra, took refuge in a sandwich shop during the conflicts of June 20,
    1981. However, the guards found them there and sent both to the Evin
    prison. The demonstration of June 20, 1981, took place in protest against
    the parliament s impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic
    Republic systematic policy of excluding the MKO from the country s
    political scene, the refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO
    leaders and his insistence for them to disarm. The MKO had until then
    supported the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function
    within the framework of the new political system. On June 20, the
    Organization officially changed its policy and tried to overthrow the
    regime by organizing mass demonstrations, in which some of the
    demonstrators were armed, all over the country. These demonstrations,
    which were severely suppressed and resulted in the killing of dozens of
    demonstrators, were followed by a wave of mass arrests and executions by
    the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that targeted not only
    the MKO, but all other opposition groups. The massive repression,
    unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized as
    official government policy the months-old state harassment and suppression
    of dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Ms. Karimian was tortured during interrogations.
    According to her former fellow inmates, she suffered from chronic pain in
    her shoulder blade and had lost function in one hand as a result of
    torture with Qapan (steelyard): Qapan (Steelyard) was a common torture
    method during interrogations. In this method, the prisoner was handcuffed
    using the steelyard behind the back with one arm reaching the other from
    above the head. The pressure usually resulted in fractions in the shoulder
    blade. To make it more effective, the prisoner was usually suspended in
    the air using the steelyard. Ms. Karimian spent seven years at Evin and
    Qezelhesar prisons. Her former fellow inmates recall that she was
    specially the target of aggression by the prison head because of her
    elegant figure and higher education. She was mainly held in the punishment
    ward, where the doors were kept locked at all times. Upon the instigation
    of a new torture method called the Grave, she spent seven months in the
    grave. The grave was a method of torture where the prisoner was
    blindfolded and forced to sit on the floor between divider boards. The
    space between the dividers was so little that the boards touched the legs
    and feet as the prisoner sits inside, preventing any movement. The back of
    the grave was open so the prisoners could be watched at all times. The
    front of the box might also have been open if the prisoner is positioned
    to face a wall. A prisoner may be forced to sit in this position for
    months. Trial According to Mina Entezari, Ms. Karimian was tried following
    her arrest and sentenced to 15 years in prison. It is not known whether a
    second trial was held in which her sentence was changed to death.
    According to the available information, the Iranian authorities did not
    try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence
    of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been
    questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of a religious
    judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran
    Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their
    beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is the proof of their
    illegality. They note that an
