    Information about Mr. Manuchehr Sarhadi has been drawn from an electronic
    form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with this case,
    an interview with his ex-employer who had been his cellmate for two years,
    and the website of the Union of People s Fadaiyan of Iran (UPFI). Mr.
    Sarhadi, affiliated with the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, was a victim of
    the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The Boroumand Foundation
    has collected additional information regarding the 1988 massacre from the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri; reports from human rights organizations;
    interviews with the witnesses and victims families; as well as from the
    Bidaran website. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Mr. Manuchehr Sarhadi was born in Tehran in 1947. He was an
    architecture student in Tehran University. He was married and had a
    daughter. He started his political activism in 1968 and joined the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization in 1970. He was arrested and sentenced to 15
    years imprisonment in 1976. He was released, along with many other
    political prisoners after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and he resumed his
    political activities. During the splits of his organization, he joined the
    Sixteen Azar faction. He worked as a construction manager for an
    engineering consultancy in Zahedan. He created the logo of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization. According to his cellmate, he was a nice human being
    and an artist. He used old newspapers to create shelves in prison cells
    strong enough for prisoners belongings. This helped prisoners a lot,
    considering the limited space they had. He drew beautiful drawings and
    paintings. Many prisoners handcrafts were created in his drawings. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist-Leninist group inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 Revolution, the FKO, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over its support for the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority considered the Islamic Republic
    to be a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime and supported it. After
    the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members
    solely because of their political beliefs. The Keshtgar faction (also
    known as the Sixteen Azar faction) split from the Majority branch on
    December 7, 1981, due to its opposition to uniting with the Tudeh Party.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Manuchehr Sarhadi was arrested at the entrance to
    the Karaj Highway in July of 1983. He had been exposed by an ex-comrade
    who cooperated with the Islamic Regime. He was detained at Section 3000,
    209, and Asayeshgah at the Evin prison. Mr. Sarhadi was tortured so
    severely that his feet distorted because of lashes, and their marks were
    evident after years. He had a lot of information but did not cooperate
    with interrogators. He attempted to commit suicide twice. Once he found a
    piece of wood and hit his head so many times that his skin was gone and
    his skull was broken. As a result, his injury never healed, and no hair
    was grown on top of his head. Trial Mr. Manuchehr Sarhadi was tried and
    condemned to life imprisonment in Tehran in 1987. Specific details about
    the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Sarhadi
    are unknown. According to the testimonies of leftist political prisoners
    who were tried in Gohardasht and Evin Prisons during the executions of the
    summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the
    prison after a few weeks of isolation during which prisoners were deprived
    of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. Toward
    the end of August, a three-member delegation composed of Hojatoleslam
    Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge; and
    Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry of
    Information. They asked prisoners questions about whether they were Muslim
    or Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were practicing
    Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the latter were sentenced to be
    hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The authorities never
    informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose, nor the serious
    implications of their responses. According to survivors, during the summer
    of 1988 a large number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or
    Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to the Minister of Justi
