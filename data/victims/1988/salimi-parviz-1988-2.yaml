    Mr. Parviz Salimi is one of 1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission’s Special Representative’s Report, “Names and particulars of
    persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the
    period July-December 1988,” published January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, “in all probability”
    there were several thousand victims. “Most of the alleged victims were
    members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People’s
    Fedaiyan Organization, Rah-e Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11
    mollahs were also said to be among the alleged victims.” Mr. Salimi is
    also among 3208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization whose execution was reported by the organization in a book
    entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book documents the 1988-89 mass
    execution of political prisoners. Additional information was drawn from
    the Bidaran website. Arrest and detention There is no specific information
    on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Parviz Salimi
    and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with the presence of an
    attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This
    committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs
    and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of
    the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against
    the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on his defense. In their
    open letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not
    given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter,
    rebutting the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had
    collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes
    with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are
    false considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced
    most difficult conditions [in the prison, with] visitation rights of once
    every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone
    from behind the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the
    outside world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the
    truth of our claim.” Judgment The details regarding the execution sentence
    are not available. Mr. Parviz Salimi was executed at Evin prison on
    September 26, 1988. According to available information, months after the
    executions, prison authorities informed the families about the executions
    and handed in the victims’ belongings to their families. The bodies,
    however, were not returned to them. The bodies were buried in mass graves.
    Authorities warned the families of prisoners against holding memorial
    ceremonies.
