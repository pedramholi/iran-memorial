    Information about Mr. Mohammad Taqi Hadidi has been drawn from an
    electronic form sent to Omid by an individual close to him. Mr. Hadidi is
    among 3208 members and sympathizers of the People’s Mojahedin of Iran
    Organization (PMIO) whose execution was reported by the organization in a
    book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book documents the 1988-89
    mass execution of political prisoners. Information about the mass
    executions has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir
    of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, Bidaran
    website, interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs.
    According to the sender of the electronic form, Mr. Mohammad Taqi Hadidi,
    son of Mohammad Reza, was born in a worker family in Esfehan on April 25,
    1964. At the time of the Revolution, when he became interested in politics
    and political parties, he was only 14. He became a sympathizer of the
    PMIO. Arrest and detention According to the information provided in the
    electronic form, Mr. Hadidi was arrested, on August 31, 1981, at the age
    of 17 in Esfehan. He was charged with reading and selling a newspaper
    (presumably a publication of the PMIO). First he was taken to the Hossein
    Abad mosque and the taken to the Intelligence Ministry. He was tortured
    there for 6 months as a result of which he could not walk temporarily.
    After approximately 6 months, he was transferred to the Dastgerd prison of
    Esfahan. In prison he was given the title “grandpa” because of his young
    age and short height. He had weekly visits in prison. Visitations were
    from behind a glass divider and through a telephone. Occasionally,
    visitations would be canceled due to “lack of cooperation” of the
    prisoner. Mr. Hadidi once visited his house to visit his family.
    Visitations stopped in 1988. Trial According to the sender of the
    electronic form Mr. Hadidi had said that one day he and three other
    individuals were blindfolded and taken to what, they were told, was their
    trial. First their names were asked and their affiliation with the
    People’s Mojahedin Organization. Once they all confirmed that they
    supported the Organization, they were asked if they were willing to
    cooperate in the arrest of other supporters of this Organization. They
    refused. Then the verdict was announced: two of them were sentenced to
    execution and the other two to life imprisonment. The exact date of this
    session is unknown, but according to the addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    No. 261, the two individuals condemned to death (Mehdi Zamani and Mahmud
    Gholami) were executed in late September and early October of 1981. Hence
    it can be concluded that this trial took place in September of the same
    year. Whether or not another trial condemned him to death is not known.
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Hadidi and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not
    known. According to existing information, there was no official trial with
    the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in
    1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about
    their beliefs and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of
    the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against
    the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam,” as well as being “associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin
    Organization as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and “wage war
    against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also “waging war against God” and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution d
