    Information about Mr. Saber Zafar Heidari was gathered from an electronic
    form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with this case.
    Mr. Saber Zafar Heidari s name is also listed in the book, Those Who Said
    No , published in 1999 in Paris by the Association for the Defense of
    Political Prisoners and Prisoners of Conscience in Iran. He was a victim
    of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with witnesses and victims families, as
    well as from the Bidaran website. The majority of the executed prisoners
    were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Mr. Saber Zafar Heidari, son of Hossein, was
    born in Sarab in 1942. He graduated from the Military College and the Law
    School of Tehran University. He was an Air Force Major, an electronics
    expert, and a radar expert. He was married and a member of the Tudeh
    Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran ( Hezbe Tudeh or the Party of the Masses)
    was founded in 1941 by a group of mostly communist intellectuals. Its
    non-radical reformist platform and its name reflected the founders hopes
    to attract the larger religious population. However, the Party's
    Marxist-Leninist orientation and its anti-Imperialist and anti-Fascist
    positions made it most influential among intellectuals and educated
    Iranians. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, The Tudeh , with its
    country-wide organization, including active women, youth, and labor
    groups, as well as a secret military network ( Sazman-e Nezami-ye Hezb-e
    Tudeh Iran ), played a major role in Iran s political scene. The Tudeh was
    banned, following an attempted assassination against the Shah in 1949.
    Nonetheless, the Party continued its activities, as well as its
    publications, of which there would be many. Following the 19 August 1953
    coup, the Tudeh s military network was annihilated, and many of its
    leaders were arrested or forced into exile, mostly in the Soviet Union and
    Eastern Europe. Over the years, the Party s political influence
    diminished, due to the various splits, resulting from its pro-Soviet
    stand, and policies in periods of political tension in Iran and from the
    radicalization of the left in the 1960s and 1970s. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Tudeh declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    regime to be revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported
    and collaborated with the government. Though the Party never opposed the
    Islamic Republic, it became the target of attacks in 1982, and the Party's
    leaders and many members, including those of the new secret military
    network, were arrested. The Tudeh lost scores of its members during the
    mass prison killing of 1988. Following several splits, the Party resumed
    its activities in the early 1990s, in exile. Arrest and detention
    According to the electronic form, Mr. Saber Zafar-Heidari was arrested at
    his residence on May 3, 1983, at 3:00 a.m. He was transferred to the
    Military Police Center and could only contact his family after three
    months. According to the book, Those Who Said No, he had been held at the
    Joint Committee and Qezelhesar Prison. There is no specific information on
    Mr. Zafar Heidari s arrest and detention. Trial A court at the Army Public
    Prosecutor s Office initially tried Mr. Saber Zafar Heidari in a session
    in the fall of 1983. Mohammad Reyshahri, head of the military court,
    prosecuted and condemned him to life imprisonment. Specific details about
    the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Saber
    Zafar Heidari are unknown. No information is available about the trial
    sessions. According to the testimonies of leftist political prisoners who
    were tried in Evin and Gohardasht Prisons during the executions of the
    summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the
    prison after a few weeks of isolation during which prisoners were deprived
    of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. Toward
    the end of August, a three-member delegation, composed of Hojatoleslam
    Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge; and
    Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry of
    Information, asked prisoners questions about whether they were Muslim or
    Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were practicing
    Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the latter were sentenced to be
    hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The authorities never
    informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious
    implications of their responses. During the summer of 1988, according to
    survivors, a large nu
