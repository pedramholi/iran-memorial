    Mr. Mehdi Arabi Khader is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of
    the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran website and the PMIO
    website. He was born in Mashhad in 1962. He was a farmer and a sympathizer
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Arrest and detention The exact
    date and place of arrest are not known. Mr. Arabi Khader was detained in
    the Mashhad prison and had several visits with his family. Trial According
    to the available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the
    victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence of a
    defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been
    questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of a religious
    judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran
    Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their
    beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has ever been publicly levelled
    against the victims of the 1988 mass execution. In their letters to the
    Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the accusations
    against the prisoners that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict from the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of his designated successor Ayatollah Montazeri, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMIO's members as
    "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and
    decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this
    organization are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to
    death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families
    of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were
    associated with guerrilla forces operating near the borders, the families
    submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside during their
    detention: "Our children lived under most difficult conditions. Our visits
    were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone
    every two weeks. We witnessed over seven years that they were denied
    access to anything that would have allowed them to establish contacts
    outside their prison walls." Under such conditions the families reject the
    claim of the authorities that these prisoners were able to engage with the
    political groups outside Iran. Judgment No specific information is
    available about death sentence. Mr. Mehdi Arabi Khader was executed during
    the mass killings of the political prisoners in Mashhad in 1988.
