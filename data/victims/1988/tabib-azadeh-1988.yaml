    The information about Ms. Azadeh Tabib, daughter of Seyed Hossein, was
    sent to Omid via an electronic form by an individual familiar with this
    case. She is also among 3208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO)* whose execution was reported by the organization
    in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book documents the
    1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. Ms. Tabib was born in
    Tehran on November 24, 1963. She was a high school graduating specializing
    in mathematics and physics. Arrest and detention Based on available
    information, Ms. Tabib was arrested one mid-night in May of 1984 at age 20
    in her father’s house. The source of information says that she was
    subjected to “severe physical and psychological torture” and says that for
    one year after arrest, she was kept in a solitary cell in Evin prison. Due
    to injuries she suffered as a result of bastinado, she underwent three
    surgeries on her feet. Trial Mr. Tabib was tried in Evin in the fall of
    1985, almost a year and half after her arrest. She was condemned to 10
    years in prison. This sentenced was reduced in the fall of 1986 to 4 years
    imprisonment. Specific details about the circumstances of the trials that
    led to the execution of Ms. Tabib and thousands of other individuals in
    1988 are not known. According to existing information, there was no
    official trial with attorneys or prosecutors. Those who were executed in
    1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to Minister of Justice at the
    time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly stated
    against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the
    Minister of Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting
    Iran in February 2003, the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities’ accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Tabib’s defense. In their open letter,
    the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the
    accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated
    with armed members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in clashes with
    armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are false
    considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced the most
    difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15
    days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind
    the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the outside
    world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of
    our claim.” Judgment The details regarding the execution sentence are not
    available. Ms. Tabib was hanged in Evin prison in August 1988. She was 24
    years old. Months after the executions, prison authorities informed the
    families about the executions and handed over the victims’ belongings to
    their families. The bodies, however, were not returned to them. The bodies
    were buried in mass graves. Authorities warned the families of prisoners
    not to hold memorial ceremonies for their loves ones. * The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted
    the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, their
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah’s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysi
