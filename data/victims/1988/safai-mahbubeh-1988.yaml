    Ms. Mahbubeh Safa’i is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) whose execution was reported by the
    Organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book
    documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. Additional
    information was drawn from the Bidaran website and the PMIO website. Her
    brother, Majid Safa’i, also an MKO sympathizer, was executed in 1986.
    Arrest and detention Ms. Mahbubeh Safa’i was arrested in 1981. She was
    detained at Evin, Qezelhesar, and Gohardasht prisons. Trial Ms. Mahbubeh
    Safa’i was tried and condemned to imprisonment. Whether or not another
    trial had condemned her to death is not known. According to existing
    information, there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney
    and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No
    charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass
    execution. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the accusations against the prisoners that may have led
    to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of his designated successor
    Ayatollah Montazeri, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the MKO members as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam and
    who “wage war against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this Organization are also “waging war against God”
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were
    not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating
    near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives
    from the outside during their detention: “Our children lived under most
    difficult conditions. All visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass
    divider through a telephone every two weeks. Over seven years, we
    witnessed that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed
    them to establish contacts outside their prison walls.” Under such
    conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that these
    prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside Iran.
    Judgment According to the MKO website, Ms. Mahbubeh Safa’i was executed
    during the mass killings of the political prisoners in Gohardasht Prison
    in 1988.
