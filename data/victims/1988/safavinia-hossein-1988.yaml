    Information about Mr. Hossein Safavinia was gathered from an electronic
    form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with this case.
    Mr. Hossein Safavinia, an affiliate of the Tudeh Party, is also taken from
    the book Those Who Said No , published in 1999 in Paris by the Association
    for the Defense of Political Prisoners and Prisoners of Conscience in
    Iran. He was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988.
    The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information regarding
    the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from
    human rights organizations, interviews with witnesses and victims
    families, as well as from the Bidaran website. The majority of the
    executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other
    victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Mr. Hossein
    Safavinia was born on March 10, 1952. He was married, an industrial
    engineer, and a member of the Tudeh Party of Iran. The Tudeh Party of Iran
    ( Hezbe Tudeh or the Party of the Masses) was founded in 1941 by a group
    of mostly communist intellectuals. Its non-radical reformist platform and
    its name reflected the founders hopes to attract the larger religious
    population. However, the Party's Marxist-Leninist orientation and its
    anti-Imperialist and anti-Fascist positions made it most influential among
    intellectuals and educated Iranians. In the late 1940s and early 1950s,
    the Tudeh , with its country-wide organization, including active women,
    youth, and labor groups, as well as a secret military network ( Sazman-e
    Nezami-ye Hezb-e Tudeh Iran ), played a major role in Iran s political
    scene. The Tudeh was banned following an attempted assassination against
    the Shah in 1949. Nonetheless, the Party continued its activities, as well
    as its publications, of which there would be many. Following the August
    19, 1953, coup, the Tudeh s military network was annihilated, and many of
    its leaders were arrested or forced into exile, mostly in the Soviet Union
    and Eastern Europe. Over the years, the Party s political influence
    diminished, due to various splits resulting from its pro-Soviet stand,
    policies in periods of political tension in Iran, and from the
    radicalization of the left in the 1960s and 1970s. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Tudeh declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    regime [to be] revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively
    supported and collaborated with the government. Though the Party never
    opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of its attacks in 1982,
    and the Party's leaders and many members, including those of the new
    secret military network, were arrested. The Tudeh lost scores of its
    members during the mass prison killings of 1988. Following several splits,
    the Party resumed its activities in the early 1990s in exile. Arrest and
    detention According to the Bidaran website, Mr. Hossein Safavinia was
    arrested on May 1, 1982. There is no specific information concerning his
    arrest and detention. Trial According to the electronic form (above), Mr.
    Hossein Safavinia had been tried in court and condemned to five years
    imprisonment. Specific details about the circumstances of the trials that
    led to the execution of Mr. Hossein Safavinia are unknown. According to
    the testimonies of leftist political prisoners who were tried in Evin and
    Gohardasht Prisons during the executions of the summer of 1988. The trials
    took place in a room on the ground floor of the prison, after a few weeks
    of isolation, during which prisoners were deprived of visitation,
    television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. Toward the end of
    August, a three-member delegation composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the
    prosecutor, Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge, and Hojatoleslam
    Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry of Information asked
    prisoners questions about whether they were Muslim or Marxist, whether
    they prayed, and if their parents were practicing Muslims. Based on the
    prisoners responses, the latter were sentenced to be hanged or flogged
    until they agreed to pray. The authorities never informed prisoners about
    the delegation s purpose and the serious implications of their responses.
    During the summer of 1988, according to survivors, a large number of
    prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or leftist groups were executed
    for not recanting their beliefs. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    the Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
