    Information about Mr. Bahram Qorbani was gathered from an electronic form
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with this case, the
    website of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, and from the book, Those Who
    Said No , published in 1999 in Paris by the Association for the Defense of
    Political Prisoners and Prisoners of Conscience in Iran. Mr. Bahram
    Qorbani is also listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were reported by the
    organization in a book titled, Crime Against Humanity . He is also one of
    1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission s Special
    Representative s Report published on January 26, 1989. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families,
    as well as from the Bidaran website. * According to the electronic form,
    Mr. Bahram Qorbani was single and born in Qa mshahr; however, according to
    other sources, he was born in Sari. According these sources, he was 29 and
    a high school graduate. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded
    in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary, and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a
    split within the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January
    of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along
    with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and
    recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution
    and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic s leaders. ** Arrest and Detention No
    specific information is available on Mr. Bahram Qorbani's arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on Mr. Bahram Qorbani s
    trial. According to the testimonies of some of the political prisoners who
    were tried during the executions of the summer of 1988 in some of the
    prisons, the trials took place in a room in the prison after a few weeks
    of isolation during which prisoners were deprived of visitation,
    television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and
    September, a three-member delegation composed of the public prosecutor, a
    religious judge, and a representative of the Ministry of Information asked
    prisoners questions about their views on Mojahedin, whether they would
    renounce their beliefs, and if they were ready to cooperate against the
    Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the prisoners would have been
    charged as counter-revolutionary, anti-religion and anti-Islam, as well as
    being, associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups
    based near the borders, and would be sentenced to death. The authorities
    never informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious
    implications of their responses. During the summer of 1988, according to
    survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or
    Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to the then-Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue
    that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed when they were retried and sentenced to death.
    Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of the
    1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988)
    and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the
    families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations against the
    prisoners accusations that may have led to their exec
