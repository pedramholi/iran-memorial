    Mr. Qodratollah Moqimi is one of the victims in the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In addition to members
    of those Marxist-Leninist organizations oppose to the Islamic Republic,
    activists of organizations that were not against the Islamic Republic were
    also among the victims of these mass killings. The information about Mr.
    Qodratollah Moqimi is taken from the book "The Tudeh Martyrs" by The Tudeh
    Party of Iran Publications and the book "Memories" by Mohammad Rayshahri
    (the Chief Judge of the time) published by the Center for Islamic
    Revolution Documents. He was physician and a navy officer. He was also a
    member of the secret military branch of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party
    of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist
    and it supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party played a
    major role on Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second
    time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the
    Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr.
    Qodratollah Moqimi was arrested in 1983. Trial According to the book
    "Memories", Mr. Qodratollah Moqimi was first tried in Tehran and condemned
    to 13 years imprisonment. During this trial, ten people were tried as "the
    fourth group of the Tudeh Party members who infiltrated the armed forces."
    There is no other information about this trial. There is no specific
    information about the circumstances of trials that condemned thousands of
    political prisoners to death in a few months period in 1988. According to
    the available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims
    of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense
    lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee, composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argued that the official
    secrecy surrounding these executions was proof of their illegality. They
    noted that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and
    sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already
    completed serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death.
    Charges According to the book "Memories", the charges against Mr.
    Qodratollah Moqimi were announced as "membership in a secret network,
    reporting to the organization, attending the street meetings of the
    organization, arranging party meetings in his home, and paying 1000 tomans
    to the Party monthly." No charge was ever publicly levelled against the
    victims of the 1988 mass execution. In their letters to the Minister of
    Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February
    2003), the families of the victims refer to the accusations levelled
    against the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution.
    These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims
    regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict,
    Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not
    believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also "waging
    war against God" and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves
    in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with
    guerrilla forces operating near the borders, the families submit the
    isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our
    children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10
    minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We
    witnessed, over the past seven years, that they were d
