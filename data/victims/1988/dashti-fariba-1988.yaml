    Information about Ms. Fariba Dashti was obtained from an Omid Memorial
    electronic form filled in by one of her former fellow inmates. Ms. Dashti
    is among the 3208 members and sympathizers of the People’s Mojahedin of
    Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was reported by the organization
    in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book documents the
    1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. Additional information was
    drawn from the Bidaran website. Ms. Dashti lived with her family in Abadan
    until the start of the Iran-Iraq war. Upon the occupation of the city by
    the Iraqi army, they were forced to leave and took residence in Tehran.
    She was a sympathizer with the PMIO. In prison, she was an open and
    free-spirited young woman who treated all her fellow inmates warmly
    regardless of their political positions. She raised everybody’s spirits by
    poking fun and telling jokes. Arrest and detention Ms. Dashti was kept in
    Ward 3, Unit 1 of Qezelhesar Prison during 1985 and was transferred to
    Evin and the “punishment wards” in 1986. From 1987 to the time of her
    execution in the summer of 1988, she was kept in Ward 1 of the Asayeshgah
    (literally meaning “sanitarium”) section, where the cell doors were kept
    locked at all times. Inmates were taken to the bathroom three times in 24
    hours and were given 30 minutes each time to use the toilet, shower, or
    wash their dishes or clothes as needed. Trial Ms. Dashti was tried and
    sentenced to life in prison years before she was executed. It is not clear
    whether or not a second trial was held to issue the death sentence.
    According to the available information, the Iranian authorities did not
    try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence
    of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been
    questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of a religious
    judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran
    Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their
    beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is the proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving, at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners;
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as
    well as being “associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI’s members as “hypocrites” who do not believe in Islam
    and “wage war against God” and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also “waging war against God”
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families of the
    prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend
    themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were associated
    with guerillas operating near the borders, the families submit the
    isolation of their relatives from the outside during their detention: “Our
    children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10
    minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We
    witnessed during the past seven years that they were denied access to
    anything that would have allowed them to establish contacts outside their
    prisons walls.” Under such conditions the families reject the claim of the
    authorities that these prisoners were able to engage with any political
    group outside Iran. Judgment Ms. Fariba Dashti was hanged at Evin prison
    in July 1988. The details of the death sentence are not known.
