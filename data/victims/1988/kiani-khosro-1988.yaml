    Mr. Khosrow Kiani, born in Tehran, is among 3208 members and sympathizers
    of the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity.
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran. website. Further
    information regarding this execution was sent to Omid via an electronic
    form by a person familiar with the case. Arrest and detention No specific
    information is available on Mr. Kiani's arrest and detention. The form
    mentions that he was arrested in 1981 while serving his 2-year mandatory
    military service. He was detained at the Evin, Gezelhesar, and lastly
    Gohardasht Prisons. He was allowed visitation with his family until 1988.
    Trial According to the electronic form form, Mr. Kiani was sentenced to
    serve a 15-year prison term. Specific details about the circumstances of
    the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Kiani and thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with attorneys or prosecutors. Those who were
    executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official
    secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They
    note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and
    sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already
    completed when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly leveled against the defendant. In their letters to the
    Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners; accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who
    do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available regarding the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the
    families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerillas operating near the borders, the
    families submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside during
    their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits
    were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone
    every two weeks. We witnessed during the past seven years that they were
    denied access to anything that would have allowed them to establish
    contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such conditions the families
    reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were able to
    engage with any political group outside Iran. Judgment No sentence was
    issued publicly. Mr. Kiani was executed at the Gohardasht Prison in the
    August of 1988.
