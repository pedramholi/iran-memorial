    Ms. Parvin Ha'eri is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the Organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran website and the PMIO
    website. She had a Master’s Degree. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Ms. Parvin Ha'eri
    was arrested during 1981. She was detained in both Evin and Gohardasht
    prisons. According to the MKO website, she was tortured severely. Trial
    Ms. Parvin Ha'eri was first tried and condemned to imprisonment. There is
    no information on the time and place of her first trial. Whether or not
    there was a second trial that condemned her to death is not know.
    According to the available information, the Iranian authorities did not
    try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence
    of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been
    questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of a religious
    judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran
    Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their
    beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly levelled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the accusations against the prisoners that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict from the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of his designated successor
    Ayatollah Montazeri, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMIO's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and who "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still
    approve of the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war
    against God" and should be sentenced to death. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available about her defence. In their
    open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not
    given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion
    that prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived under most difficult
    conditions. All visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. Over seven years, we witnessed that
    they were denied access to anything that would have allowed them to
    establish contacts outside their prison walls." Under such conditions the
    families reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were
    able to engage with the political groups outside Iran. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the defendant’s execution. Ms.
    Parvin Ha'eri was executed during the mass killings of the political
    prisoners at Evin Prison in August 1988.
