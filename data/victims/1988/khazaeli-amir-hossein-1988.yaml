    The information about Mr. Amir Hossein Khaza’eli has been drawn from an
    interview with a friend of Mr. Khaza’eli, which has been sent to Omid via
    an electronic form. Additional information has been taken from the book
    The Tudeh Martyrs , by The Tudeh Party of Iran publications. Information
    about the 1988 massacre has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from
    the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations,
    interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Mr. Khaza’eli
    was born in 1952 in Khoramshahr (Lorestan province). He was married and
    had a child who was born when Mr. Khaza’eli was in detention (electronic
    form). He was an air force captain in Dezful (Khuzestan province) and
    served in the front for three years during the Iran-Iraq war. He was a
    member of the Tudeh Party (the Tudeh book). Mr. Khaza’eli was a victim of
    the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the
    executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other
    victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. The Tudeh Party of
    Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh’s ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it
    supported the former Soviet Union’s policies. The Tudeh Party played a
    major role in Iran's political scene until it was banned for a second time
    following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh
    Party declared the Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Tudeh Party never opposed the Islamic Republic,
    it became the target of its attacks from 1982 when most of the Party’s
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr.
    Khaza’eli was arrested in April/May, 1983, and interrogated at the Joined
    Committee. Trial Mr. Khaza’eli was tried and condemned to four years
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Khaza’eli and thousands of other individuals in
    1988 are not known. According to existing information, there was no
    official trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who
    were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges At the fisrt trial, Mr. Khaza’eli
    was charged with “membership in the Tudeh Party” (electronic form). No
    charge was publicly levelled against the victims of the 1988 massacre. In
    their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities’ accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who do not
    believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also “waging
    war against God” and should be sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not
    belong to the Organization named by the leader of the Islamic Republic,
    may have been accused of being “anti-religion” for not having renounced
    his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners said that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrilla troops operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolati
