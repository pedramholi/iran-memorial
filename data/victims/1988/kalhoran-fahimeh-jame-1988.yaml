    Ms. Fahimeh Jame Kalhoran is among 3208 members and sympathizers of the
    People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity.
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran website. Ms. Jame
    Kalhoran is also one of the 1533 executed prisoners listed by the
    Association of Iranian Women of K ln (Germany). The list published in 1997
    is entitled: "A partial list of names of women executed by the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Further information was sent to Omid via an electronic
    form by one of her former cellmates. Ms. Jame Kalhoran was born in 1960
    and a Mathematics student at the Karaj College. She is remembered for
    being kind and open-minded. Arrest and detention According to the form,
    Ms. Jame Kalhoran was arrested in 1981. She was detained at the Evin
    Prison and her former cellmate recalls that they were in held in the
    disciplinary section of the prison from 1986 until Ms. Jame Kalhoran s
    execution. Trial Ms. Jame Kalhoran was reportedly tried and had received a
    10 or 15 year prison sentence before being executed. There is no specific
    information about the circumstances of these trials that condemned this
    defendant and thousands of other political prisoners to death in a few
    months period. Relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute
    the legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of
    executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of
    Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is the proof of their illegality. They note that an
    overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to
    prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving, at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No
    charge has been publicly leveled against the defendant. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities' accusations against the prisoners; accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the
    PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war
    against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    regarding the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense In their
    open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not
    given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion
    that prisoners were associated with guerillas operating near the borders,
    the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside
    during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions.
    Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a
    telephone every two weeks. We witnessed during the past seven years that
    they were denied access to anything that would have allowed them to
    establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such conditions
    the families reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were
    able to engage with any political group outside Iran. Judgment No sentence
    was issued publicly. Ms. Jame Kalhoran s cellmate is quoted on the form
    stating that all the Mojaheds from the disciplinary section were executed.
    They were lined up for execution in the hallways three times, but each
    time the prison authorities had told them, that it was not their turn yet
    to be executed. Ms. Jame Kalhoran was the second-to-last prisoner to be
    executed from the disciplinary section during the mass prison executions
    of 1988-89.
