    The information about Mr. Mas ud Rashtchian, son of Mehdi, has been sent
    to Omid by a person familiar with this case via an electronic form. Mr.
    Rashtchian was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in
    1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims families, and witnesses memoirs.
    Mr. Rashtchian was born in Tehran on April 21, 1953. He was an electrical
    engineer and affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Rashtchian was arrested in his house in Tehran on October
    16, 1981. He was interrogated in Evin prison and during his 7 years of
    imprisonment, he was transferred to several different prisons. Once a
    month, he had visits with his family for ten minutes. He was denied the
    right to have an attorney. Trial Mr. Rashtchian was tried and condemned to
    life imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials
    that led to the execution of Mr. Rashtchian and thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney and
    prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges In his
    first trial Mr. Rashtchian was charged with helping a sick member of
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and giving this individual
    the sum of 1500 tumans. No charge has been publicly leveled against the
    victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of
    Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February
    2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities accusations
    against the prisoners accusations that may have led to their execution.
    These accusations include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An edict of the Leader
    of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization as hypocrites who do not believe in Islam and wage war
    against God and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also waging war against God and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rashtchian s
    defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners noted that
    defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court.
    The same letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners (from
    inside the prison) had collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin
    Organization in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states
    that such claims are false considering the circumstances in prisons; for
    our children faced most difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation
    rights of once every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through
    a telephone from behind the glass window, and were deprived of any
    connection with the outside world. We faced such conditions for seven
    years, which proves the truth of our claim. Judgment The details regarding
    the execution sentence are not available. According to the available
    information, Mr. Mas ud Rashtchian was executed in August 1981 at Evin
    prison. His family was informed of the execution when they were given Mr.
    Rashtchian s clothes. His body was never returned to the family. They also
    were never information of the place of burial.
