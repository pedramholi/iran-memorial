    Mr. Jahan Ara is among 3208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO, also PMIO) whose execution was reported by the
    organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . Additional
    information about him has been sent to Omid via an electronic forms by
    persons familiar with his case and drawn from a 1997 interview with his
    mother published in Jila Baniya'qub's weblog, Ruznamehnegarim . The
    majority of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims families, and witnesses memoirs.
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Mr. Jahan Ara, born in Abadan and had 4 brothers. One of his
    brothers was the commander of the Revolutionary Guards Corp in Khoramshahr
    and was killed in the Iran Iraq war and another brother disappeared during
    the same war. A third brother was, according to his mother's interview,
    killed in detention under torture before the revolution. Mr Jahan Ara's
    mother remembers him as a pious young man. Arrest and detention Mr. Jahan
    Ara was arrested in 1981 during a street protest; he was imprisoned in
    Evin, Qezelhesar, and Gohardasht prisons (Tehran province); until the
    beginning of mass executions of 1988, he had visit with his family.
    According to his mother, prison conditions were very difficult. For
    example, during winter, he could only shower with cold water. (Weblog
    Ruznamehnegarim- electronic form) Trial Mr. Jahan Ara was tried at an
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal and condemned, according to his mother, to
    8 years imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials
    that led to the execution of Mr. Jahan Ara and thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney and
    prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled
    against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the
    Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities
    accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as hypocrites who do not
    believe in Islam and wage war against G
