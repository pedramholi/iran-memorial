    Mr. Hadi Jalalabadi Farahani is listed among 3,208 members and
    sympathizers of the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose
    execution was reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    against Humanity. This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran the
    Mojahedin websites. Mr. Jalalabadi Farahani was born in Tehran. He was a
    high school student and an active member of the militia of the People's
    Mojahedin of Iran Organization. Arrest and detention There is no specific
    information on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Mr. Hadi Jalalabadi
    Farahani was arrested on June 13, 1981. He was detained in Evin,
    Qezelhesar, and Gohardasht prisons for seven years. He was allowed no
    visitors for the first seven months after his arrest. According to the
    Mojahedin website, he was tortured severely. He was put in a metal coffin
    for a long period of time during the severe summer heat. As a result, most
    of his body was burned. Trial Mr. Jalalabadi Farahani was tried three
    times. He was condemned to death in his first trial in 1983; but, the
    ruling was suspended for eleven months. In 1984, the Supreme Judiciary
    Council changed the execution verdict to 13 years imprisonment. His third
    trial was in 1988. No information is available about this trial except
    that it ended with an execution verdict. It should be noted that there is
    no information about the condition of similar trials that condemned
    thousands of political prisoners to death during this time. The relatives
    of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the
    judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran.
    In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they
    argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of
    their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving at the time they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against
    the prisoners – accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims
    regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict,
    Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not
    believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of positions taken by this organization are also "waging war
    against God" and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available about the defendant’s
    defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that
    defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court.
    Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrillas’
    operating near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their
    relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our children lived in
    most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a
    glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed during the
    past seven years that they were denied access to anything that would have
    allowed them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under
    such conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that
    these prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside
    Iran. Judgment No specific information is available about the defendant’s
    execution sentence. Mr. Hadi Jalalabadi Farahani was condemned to death at
    his third trial in 1988. When his mother went to the Evin prison to ask
    about him in December, the prison officials gave her some of her son's
    belongings and told her that he had executed by firing squad on September
    25, 1988.
