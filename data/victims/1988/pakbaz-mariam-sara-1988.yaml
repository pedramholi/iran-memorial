    Ms. Mariam (Sara) Pakbaz is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of
    the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity.
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran the PMIO websites. Ms.
    Pakbaz was a talented student who graduated from high school when she was
    14 years old. She was a MKO sympathizer and an active militia member for
    this Organization in the South Tehran Associations. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown.
    According to the MKO website, Ms. Pakbaz, 16, was arrested in Tehran on
    October 3, 1980. According to the same source, she was tortured so
    severely that when one of her relatives saw her in the Evin Prison by
    chance, she couldn't recognize her. She had some visits with her family
    during her eight-year imprisonment; however, there are no details of these
    visits. Trial There is no record of this trial. Also, there is no specific
    information about the circumstances of such trials that condemned this
    defendant and thousands of other political prisoners to death in a few
    months period. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988
    refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of
    executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of
    Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed serving at the
    time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly leveled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners, accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who
    do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. According to the MKO website, Ms. Pakbaz
    was arrested for having a copy of the Mojahed publication. Defense No
    information is available about the defendant’s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrillas’ operating near the borders, the
    families submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside during
    their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits
    were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone
    every two weeks. We witnessed during the past seven years that they were
    denied access to anything that would have allowed them to establish
    contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such conditions the families
    reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were able to
    engage with the political groups outside Iran. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the defendant’s execution. Ms. Pakbaz was
    hanged in the Evin prison on September 30, 1988. According to the MKO
    website, at one point in 1986, the Revolutionary Guards gave her bag to
    those who came to visit her and said: "Take this! She will repent soon and
    come out."
