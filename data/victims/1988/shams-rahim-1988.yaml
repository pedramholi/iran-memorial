    Mr. Rahim Shams is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and Particulars of
    Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran from July
    through December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report specifies
    that although 1000 names are mentioned, "in all probability" there were
    several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were members of the
    MKO. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization,
    Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization as well as 11 mollahs were also said
    to be among the alleged victims." َََAdditional information about Mr.
    Rahim Shams is taken from the book Martyrs of the Tudeh Party by The Tudeh
    Party of Iran Publications and the book Memories by Mohammad Rayshahri
    (the Chief Judge of the time) published by the Center for Islamic
    Revolution Documents. Mr. Shams graduated from the Military College and
    was an army officer. After the revolution, he joined the Tudeh Party.
    According to the book Memories , he worked in the Eteka company for the
    Defense Ministry. But, he was fired and held no public job from that time
    until he was arrested. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The
    Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported the former
    Soviet Union's policies. The Party played a major role in Iran's political
    scene until it was banned for the second time following the August 19,
    1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah
    Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members
    were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The details of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Rahim Shams was arrested in
    February, 1983. Trial According to the book Memories , Mr. Rahim Shams was
    initially tried in Tehran on December 10 and 11, 1983 and was condemned to
    life imprisonment. The details of a possible second trial are unknown.
    According to the available information, the Iranian authorities did not
    try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence
    of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been
    questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of a religious
    judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran
    Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their
    beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges According to the book Memories , at the trial
    in 1983, the charges against Mr. Shams, who was a retired captain in
    eighth row of "the trial of the first group of Tudeh members who
    infiltrated the armed forces" were: "Spying, membership and activity in
    the secret military network with the goal of overthrowing the Islamic
    Republic, and paying 10 thousands Tomans membership fee along with gas
    coupons to the Tudeh Party, Mohareb (fighter) and Mofsed (corruptor on
    Earth)." No information is available about the charges in a possible
    second trial. No charge has been publicly levelled against the victims of
    the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister of Justice
    (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003),
    the families of the victims refer to the authorities' accusations that may
    have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt According to the book
    Memories , evidence used against the defendant's in his first trial was
    "the statements of higher ranking party members Mohammad Mehdi Partovi and
    Mohammad Mo'azez." Defense No information is available concerning Mr.
