    Mr. Mehdi Hassanipak is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and
    Particulars of Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    from July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report specifies
    that although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all probability" there were
    several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were members of the
    Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan
    Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization as well as 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims." Complementary information
    has been gathered from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of
    human rights organizations, interviews with family members, and memoirs of
    witnesses by the Boroumand Foundation. The information about Mr. Mehdi
    Hassanipak is taken from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran
    by the Tudeh Party Publications. He was born in Ray. Having graduating
    from high school, he served his compulsory military service. Then, he
    worked as a planner during the day and studied Interior Design at the
    Vanak Technology Institute at night. He got his Associate Degree and
    worked as a school teacher. He joined the Tudeh Party when he was in high
    school. Under the previous regime, he was arrested in 1975 and condemned
    to five years imprisonment. After the revolution, he was released from
    prison and continued his political activities in the Farmers Branch of the
    Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh
    ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the former
    Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran's political scene
    until it was banned for the second time following the August 19, 1953
    coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and
    the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and
    actively supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed
    the Islamic Republic, it became the target of government attacks in 1982
    when most of the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Mehdi Hassanipak was arrested on February 6, 1983. The above
    source quotes some of his cellmates saying: "I witnessed him being
    tortured for a long time. Every day, they took him with his feet bandaged
    and then at night returned his half-dead body He was severely tortured. He
    was lashed a lot. There were burn marks on his calves As a result of the
    torture, his spleen bled profusely and he suffered from stomach problems
    He was kept in solitary confinement for 17 months. For two full months, he
    was blindfolded and his legs were almost paralyzed." Trial Mr. Mehdi
    Hassanipak was tried and condemned to 20 years imprisonment. Whether or
    not a second trial condemned him to death is not known. According to the
    available information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of
    the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense
    lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee, composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argued that the official
    secrecy surrounding these executions was proof of their illegality. They
    noted that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and
    sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already
    completed serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death.
    Charges No charge was ever publicly levelled against the defendant. In
    their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. It is possible that the prisoners who
    were members of organizations other than the Mojahedin Kha
