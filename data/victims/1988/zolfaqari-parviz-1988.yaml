    The information about Mr. Parviz Zolfaqari, son of Khodamorad, is based on
    three electronic forms sent to Omid by a person familiar with this case.
    According to this information, he was born in Shahr-e Kord in 1952. He had
    an associate s degree in foreign languages and was a high school teacher.
    After he was expelled from teaching, he opened a bookstore. He was a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. His name is on the
    website of this organization among the victims. He was arrested for the
    first time in 1982 and served his one year prison sentence. The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted
    the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention According
    to the information sent to Omid, Mr. Parviz Zolfaqari was arrested at his
    bookshop in Shahr-e Kord in July of 1988 in the afternoon. Apparently, he
    was taken for questioning to the Intelligence Office in Shahr-e Kord from
    where he never returned. He was denied the right to an attorney. According
    to this report, Mr. Zolfaqari was tortured severely. Quoting his
    cellmates, when his three-year-old daughter went to visit him in prison,
    interrogators snapped his tongue with a pincer and told his daughter that
    we have to take his tongue out to stop him from bad mouthing. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. According to the
    information sent to Omid, Mr. Parviz Zolfaqari was not tried. Charges No
    information is available on the defendant s charges. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available about the defendant s defence. Judgment No specific information
    is available about the defendant s execution. According to the information
    sent to Omid, Mr. Parviz Zolfaqari died in the Intelligence Prison in
    Shahr-e Kord from torture on August 12, 1988. According to this report,
    burns marks, a broken shoulder, and smashed skull were evident on his
    body. Mr. Zolfaqari s body was buried in the Shahr-e Kord cemetery under
    very hard security conditions on August 16, 1988.
    _________________________ *The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with to the Islamic Republic authorities different
    interpretation of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of
    the new regime referred to the Mojahedin as Hypocrites and the Hezbollahi
    supporters of the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly
    during demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the
    death of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. O
