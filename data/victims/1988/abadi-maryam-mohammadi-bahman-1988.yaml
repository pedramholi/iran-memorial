    Mohammadi Bahman Abadi is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were reported by the

    Representative s Report, published on January 26, 1989. Ms. Maryam
    Mohammadi Bahman Abadi is one of the 1,533 executed prisoners listed by
    the Association of Iranian Women of K ln (Germany). The list, published on
    September 10, 1997, is titled: "A partial list of names of women executed
    by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Boroumand Foundation has collected
    additional information regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from the human rights organizations,
    interviews with witnesses and victims families; as well as the Bidaran
    website. * Ms. Maryam Mohammadi Bahman Abadi was born in Tehran. She was a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and was active in the
    Social Faction of this organization. According to her cellmate, Maryam was
    a well-known and unforgettable character in the prison. It seemed that
    various pressures and torture did not change her morale. Her loving
    laughter attracted attention in all the cells and sections of the prison.
    One of her outstanding characteristics was her positive and happy attitude
    towards others . She was so energetic and playful that everyone called her
    earthquake jokingly . Maryam was skillful in stone carving and creating
    miniature things with stone. Sometimes she worked for weeks on a piece.
    One of her masterpieces was carving a beautiful flower behind barbed wire
    on a small black stone, using only a needle. She then used blanket threads
    to create a beautiful and unique necklace. Her brother, Reza Mohammadi
    Bahman Abadi was also hanged at Evin Prison in 1988. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released,
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and to recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. ** Arrest and Detention According
    to the Mojahedin Khalq website, quoting a cellmate of Ms. Maryam Mohammadi
    Bahman Abadi, she was arrested during a street demonstration on September
    27, 1981. She was detained for seven years in Qezelhesar, Gohardasht, and
    Evin prisons and was tortured severely. According to her cellmate, who met
    her at the Punishment Section of Qezelhesar, She was continuously tortured
    physically and mentally for months in a grave-like wooden containment,
    blindfolded and in absolute silence. When she returned to the public cell,
    she suffered from various diseases, including harsh backaches and severe
    arthritis, in such a way that touching water caused all the joints in her
    hands and feet to swell up and become painful. Maryam was first
    transferred to the Evin prison in 1985. Then, she was transferred to
    Gohardasht. All female political prisoners were transferred to Evin Prison
    in the fall of 1987. Ms. Maryam Mohammadi Bahman Abadi had some
    visitations with her family, but the dates of such visitations are
    unknown. Her cellmate describes these visitations as follows: Visitations
    normally included 20 people behind a glass wall and by phone. Each person
    took a cubicle with a number. After ten minutes, phones were cut off, and
    the visitation was over. Trial Ms. Maryam Mohammadi Bahman Abadi was first
    tried and condemned to death, but the sentence had been reduced to life
