    Information about Mr. Hamid Montazeri was gathered from an electronic form
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation and an interview with his daughter,
    Shokufeh Montazeri. Mr. Hamid Montazeri is also cited in the list
    published by the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, Majority Branch on April of
    2002, and the book, Those Who Said No, published in 1999 in Paris by the
    Association for the Defense of Political Prisoners and Prisoners of
    Conscience in Iran. He was a victim of the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional
    information regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports from human rights organizations, interviews with
    witnesses and victims families, as well as from the Bidaran website. The
    majority of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Mr.
    Hamid Montazeri, son of Abdolrasul, was born in Bam on July 29, 1952. He
    was married with two children, Shokufeh and Omid. His son, Omid, was born
    when his father was imprisoned. Mr. Hamid Montazeri received his
    elementary and high school education in Bam. Then he continued his
    education at the Law School of Tehran University. His school friends
    called him Robin Hood, since he was adventurist and very active. Before
    the revolution, during his college years, he was arrested and imprisoned
    until 1978. After the revolution, he joined the Rah-e Kargar Organization
    and, later, in 1980, he joined the Fadaiyan Khalq Majority Organization.
    He became a member of the Tehran Provincial Committee of this organization
    and participated in the first Congress of the organization in Tashkent,
    Soviet Union. He was an advisor to the Central Committee of the
    organization when arrested. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist-Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. After the 1979 Revolution, the
    organization, which renounced armed struggle, split over their support of
    the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority
    supported and considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and
    anti-imperialist regime. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic
    Republic sought its members solely because of their political beliefs.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Hamid Montazeri was arrested, along with his
    pregnant wife, after leaving his sister s house in Tehran, in August of
    1986. Later, the family realized that he had been under surveillance by
    the Intelligence Ministry for awhile. They were both arrested and
    transferred to the Komiteh-Moshtarak prison.* After Mr. Montazeri was
    transferred to the Evin prison, he was allowed to visit his family behind
    a screen twice a month. During these visitations, his wife realized that
    he had been tortured severely. He could not walk normally and his hands
    and elbows were injured. He was very thin, and his hair had suddenly
    become grey. According to Shokufeh, Mr. Montazeri s daughter, the first
    visitation took place in April 1987. My mother had already been released,
    and she took me with her. Trial Specific details about the circumstances
    of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Hamid Montazeri are
    unknown. According to the testimonies of leftist political prisoners who
    were tried in Evin and Gohardasht Prisons during the executions of the
    summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the
    prison after a few weeks of isolation, during which prisoners were
    deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time.
    Toward the end of August, a three-member delegation composed of
    Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor, Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious
    judge, and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry
    of Information asked prisoners questions about whether they were Muslim or
    Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were practicing
    Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the latter were sentenced to be
    hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The authorities never
    informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious
    implications of their responses. During the summer of 1988, according to
    survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or
    Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then-Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note tha
