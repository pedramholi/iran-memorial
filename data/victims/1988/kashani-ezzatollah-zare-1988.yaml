    Mr. Ezzatollah Zare Kashani, son of Mohammad, is one of the victims in the
    mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. He is one of 1000 people
    identified in a UN Human Rights Commission s Special Representative s
    Report, Names and particulars of persons allegedly executed by the Islamic
    Republic of Iran during the period July-December 1988, published January
    26, 1989. The report specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, in
    all probability there were several thousand victims. Most of the alleged
    victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh
    Party, People s Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims. The information about Mr. Ezzatollah Zare Kashani is taken from
    an electronic form sent to Omid by a person close to him as well as from
    the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party
    Publications. He was born in Shahr-e Rey in 1928. He joined the Tudeh
    Party in 1944 when he was very young. After the Revolution, in 1981, he
    became a member of the Central Committee of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh
    Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-
    Leninist and it supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party
    played a major role in Iran s political scene until it was banned for the
    second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution,
    the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party s
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention Mr. Zare Kashani
    was arrested without a warrant by the Revolutionary Guards on February 6,
    1983 at 10 p.m. for membership in the Central Committee of the Tudeh Party
    of Iran (electronic form). According to the abovementioned book, he
    suffered from stomach and kidney pain due to severe torture. Trial
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Zare Kashani and thousands of other individuals in 1988
    are not known. According to existing information, there was no official
    trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were
    executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge was ever publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    accusations against the prisoners that may have led to their execution.
    These accusations include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An edict of the Leader
    of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri,
    his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the Mojahedin members as hypocrites who do not believe in Islam
    and wage war against God and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also waging war against God
    and should be sentenced to death. It is possible that the prisoners who
    were members of organizations other than the Mojahedin were charge for
    being anti-religious and were condemned for insisting on their beliefs.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the families
    of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that prisoners were
    associated with guerrilla forces operating near the borders, the families
    submit the isolation of their relatives from the outside during their
    detention: Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Our visits
    were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider through a telephone
    every two weeks. Over the past seven years, we witnessed
