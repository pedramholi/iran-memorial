    Mr. Nader Mehraban is one of the victims in the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. In addition to members of those
    Marxist-Leninist organizations oppose to the Islamic Republic such as the
    Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, activists of
    organizations such as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority)
    that were not against the Islamic Republic, were also among the victims of
    this mass killings. The information about Mr. Nader Mehraban is taken from
    the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party by The Tudeh Party of Iran
    publication. He was born in Rasht on February 21, 1952. After graduating
    from high school, he went to Tehran and continued his education, majoring
    in Radio and Television. He was hired by the Radio and Television
    Ministry. He joined the Tudeh Party during the revolution. In 1980, he
    fought in the war front for some time. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created
    in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist- Leninist and it supported
    policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in
    Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second time following
    the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members
    were imprisoned. Arrest and detention Mr. Nader Mehraban was arrested in
    his work place on April 29, 1983. He was held at Evin, Komiteh Moshtarak,
    Qezelhesar, and Gohardasht prisons. According to the above book, he was
    kept incommunicado for 14 months. Later on, he had told that "I didn t see
    any light [when I was interrogated by the Joint Committee] since I was
    blindfolded and held in solitary confinement for six months." According to
    the same source, his last visit was on July 19, 1988 in Gohardasht prison.
    Trial Mr. Nader Mehraban was tried and condemned to four years
    imprisonment on November 7, 1984. Whether or not a second trial condemned
    him to death is unknown. According to the available information, the
    Iranian authorities did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in
    a court with in the presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were
    executed in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member special committee,
    composed of a religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence
    Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist
    prisoners about their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The
    relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of
    the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout
    Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi,
    they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof
    of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed serving at the time they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge was ever publicly
    levelled against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of
    Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February
    2003), the families of the victims refer to the accusations against the
    prisoners that may have led to their execution. These accusations include
    being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as
    being "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups
    based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were
    not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating
    near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives
    from the outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most
    difficult conditions. Our visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass
    divider through a telephone every two weeks. Over the past seven years, we
    witnessed that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed
    them to establish con
