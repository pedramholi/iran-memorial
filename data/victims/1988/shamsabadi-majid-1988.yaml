    The information about Mr. Majid Shamsabadi has been drawn from an
    interview with a relative. Mr. Shamsabadi was a victim of the mass
    killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims
    included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such
    as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which
    opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan
    Khalq (Majority), which did not. Mr. Shamsabadi is also among the 3208
    members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization whose
    execution was reported by the Organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity , published in 2001. Moreover, his name is mentioned in
    the book Those Who Said “No” , published in 1999 by Paris-based
    Association for the Defense of Prisoners of Conscience Political Prisoners
    in Iran. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the
    Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of
    human rights organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and
    witnesses’ memoirs. Additionally, Mr. Shamsabadi is one of 1000 people
    identified in a UN Human Rights Commission’s Special Representative’s
    Report, “Names and particulars of persons allegedly executed by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran during the period July-December 1988,” published
    January 26, 1989. The report specifies that although 1000 names are
    mentioned, “in all probability” there were several thousand victims. Mr.
    Majid Shamsabadi was a second-year student at Sharif University of
    Technology and was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    Arrest and detention There is no specific information on the defendant’s
    arrest and detention, except that he was arrested in 1981. Trial Mr.
    Shamsabadi was tried and condemned to imprisonment. Specific details on
    the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr.
    Shamsabadi and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known.
    According to existing information, there was no official trial with the
    presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988
    were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Shamsabadi’s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting
    the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had
    collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes
    with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are
    false considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced
    most difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once
    every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone
    from behind the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the
    outside world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the
    truth of our claim.” Judgment The details regarding the execution sentence
    are not available. Mr. Majid Shamsabadi w
