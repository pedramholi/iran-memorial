    Ms. Mina (Qamar) Azkia is among 3208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO, also PMIO) whose execution was reported
    by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity . This book
    documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners. Her name is
    also mentioned in an article by Ms. Mina Entezari about the victims of the
    1988 mass executions. Additional information has been drawn from two
    electronic forms sent to Omid by a relative and a former cellmate and
    colleague. Ms. Azkia was librarian at the Institute for the Intellectual
    Development of Children and Young Adults. Her brother, Dr. Azkia, was a
    prominent professor and reseacher of social sciences in Tehran University.
    Ms. Azkia was a sympathizer of the MKO (electronic forms). Arrest and
    detention Ms. Azkia had been arrested by the Prosecutor’s Office of Evin;
    she was interrogated in the same prison. No further detail is available
    regarding her arrest. She was imprisoned in ward 3 of the “sanatorium” in
    Evin from 1987 to the summer of 1988. (The “sanatorium” was a section
    where conditions were particularly difficult in order to “punish” the
    prisoners.) Ms. Azkia was an independent woman and would not follow others
    without question. She did not have good health and was mostly sick
    (electronic form). Trial Ms. Azkia was tried and condemned to
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Ms. Azkia and thousands of other individuals in 1988
    are not known. According to existing information, there was no official
    trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were
    executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Azkia’s defense. In their open letter,
    the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the
    accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated
    with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed
    forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are false
    considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most
    difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15
    days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind
    the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the outside
    world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of
    our claim.” Judgment In July/August 1988, Ms Qamar Azkia was called from
    ward 3 of the “sanatorium” along with other sympathizers of the MKO. None
    of them returned to the ward. After some time, the prison guards came and
    took her clothes. No public execution sentence has been issued for the
    victims of the 1988 mass execution. Months after the executions, prison
    authorities informed the families about the executions and handed in the
    victims’ belongings to their families. The bodies, however, were
