    Information about Mr. Ardeshir Shirinbakhsh-Masuleh (Abkenari) was
    gathered from an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a
    person familiar with this case. Mr. Ardeshir Shirinbakhsh-Masuleh
    (Abkenari) is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization, whose executions were reported by the organization in
    a book titled Crime Against Humanity . He is also one of 1,000 people
    identified in a UN Human Rights Commission Special Representative s
    Report, published on January 26, 1989. His name is also among the victims
    of the 1988 massacre on the list of Asr-e No website. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with witnesses and victims families, as
    well as from the Bidaran website. * According to the electronic form, Mr.
    Ardeshir Shirinbakhsh-Masuleh (Abkenari), son of Manaf, with
    identification certificate number 2205, issued in Some esara, was born in
    Abkenar, Bandar-e Anzali, on April 25, 1964. He was a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a
    split within the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January
    of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along
    with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to
    recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution
    and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were central to the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, whether by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic s leaders. ** Arrest and Detention Mr.
    Ardeshir Shirinbakhsh-Masuleh (Abkenari) was arrested at Behesht-e Zahra
    in Tehran on August 30, 1981. He was detained at Evin and Gohardasht
    prisons. No further information is available on his arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Ardeshir Shirinbakhsh-Masuleh
    (Abkenari) s trial. According to the testimonies of some of the political
    prisoners who were tried during the executions of the summer of 1988 in
    Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the trials took place in a room on the ground
    floor of the prison, after a few weeks of isolation, during which
    prisoners were deprived of visitations, television and radio broadcasts,
    and outdoor time. In August and September, a three-member delegation
    composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri,
    the religious judge; and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of
    the Ministry of Information asked prisoners questions about their views
    regarding the Mojahedin, whether they would renounce their beliefs, and if
    they were ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what the
    answers were, the prisoners would have been charged with counter
    revolutionary, anti-religion and anti-Islam, or, associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders, and
    would be sentenced to death. The authorities never informed prisoners
    about the delegation s purpose and the serious implications of their
    responses. During the summer of 1988, according to survivors, a large
    number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were
    executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then-Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
