    Mr. Esma'il Zolqadr is one of 1,000 people identified in the UN Human
    Rights Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and
    Particulars of Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    during the period July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The
    report specifies that although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all
    probability" there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged
    victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh
    Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization as well as 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims." Additional information about Mr. Zolqadr is taken from the book
    The Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001 by The Tudeh Party of Iran
    publications. He was a member of the Tudeh Party who had been condemned to
    life imprisonment during the previous regime. With the start of the
    revolution, he was released and began his activities with the Tudeh Party
    as a member of its Political Bureau and in charge of the Party’s treasury.
    The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh's ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The
    Tudeh Party played a major role in Iran's political scene until it was
    banned for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the
    1979 Revolution, the Tudeh Party declared the Ayatollah Khomeini and the
    Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively
    supported the new government. Although the Tudeh Party never opposed the
    Islamic Republic, it became the target of its attacks beginning in 1982
    when most of the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Mr. Zolqadr was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards on
    February 6, 1983. Trial Mr. Esma'il Zolqadr was tried and condemned to
    life imprisonment. There is no information about the trial. Also, there is
    no specific information about the circumstances of such trials that
    condemned this defendant and thousands of other political prisoners to
    death in a few months period. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refuted the legality of the judicial process that
    resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open
    letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argued that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They noted that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners
    had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either
    serving or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was publicly levelled against the
    defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners –
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence In
    their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were
    not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating
    near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives
    from the outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most
    difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass
    divider through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed, over the past
    seven years, that they were denied access to anything that would have
    allowed them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under
    such conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that
    these prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside
    Iran. It is possible that the prisoners who were members of organizations
    other than the Mojahedin Khalq were charge for being "anti religious" and
    were condemned for insisting on their beliefs. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the defendant’s execution. According to the
    book, Mr. Zolqadr was hanged during the mass killings of political
    prisoners in September
