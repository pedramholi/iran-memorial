    Kasra Akbari Kordestani, a native of Kermanshah, was politically involved
    before the fall of the Shah. Continually active, he ran the Pishgam
    Student Organization in Ahvaz. Information about Mr. Kasra Akbari
    Kordestani is based on an interview with his brother-in-law. He is one
    victim of the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri; reports
    of human rights organizations; interviews with victims families; and
    witnesses memoirs. Mr. Kasra Akbari Kordestani was born in Kermanshah in
    1945. He was a student and was imprisoned twice for political activities
    before the Revolution. The first time, in 1973, he spent one year in
    prison. He joined the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization after his release. In
    1976, he was arrested again and condemned to 15 years imprisonment. During
    the Revolution, he was released, along with other political prisoners.
    After the Revolution, he re-joined the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. He was
    active in the Kordestan Branch of the organization for some time and then
    directed the Pishgam Student Organization in Ahvaz. Then he moved to
    Tehran and worked with the Kar newspaper (the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization
    s main publication). First, he was in charge of the Farmers Page and then
    the economic articles. During this period, he translated the book,
    Purshnof Psychology. In 1981, he joined the Tudeh Party of Iran. The Tudeh
    Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh ideology was Marxist-Leninist
    and it supported the policies of the former Soviet Union. The party played
    a major role on Iran s political landscape until it was banned for a
    second time, following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Tudeh declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    regime to be revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported
    the new government. Although the p arty never opposed the Islamic
    Republic, it became the target of its attacks, beginning in 1982, when
    most of the party leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Akbari Kordestani was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards
    of the Public Prosecution Office on a street in Tehran on February 13,
    1984. According to the interviewee, during his transfer to Evin Prison, he
    threw himself out of the car, but the Guards shot and injured him in the
    back. His bloody and unconscious body was transferred to the Evin clinic.
    He spent two days in a coma. He had broken ribs, punctured lungs, and head
    injuries. They transferred him to the Heart Hospital, where doctors tried
    to save him. After months of hospitalization, he was transferred back to
    Evin Prison, and severely tortured. Trial No exact information is
    available on the defendant s trial. The first trial condemned Mr. Kasra
    Akbari Kordestani to 15 years imprisonment. Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Akbari
    Kordestani and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known.
    According to available information, the Iranian authorities did not try
    the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with the presence of a
    defense lawyer. The prisoners executed in 1988 had been questioned by a
    three-member special committee composed of a religious judge, a
    representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor.
    The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and
    their faith in God and religion. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then-Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988) and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners accusations
    that may have led to their executions. These accusations include being
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being
    associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders. An edict of the Leader of the Islamic
