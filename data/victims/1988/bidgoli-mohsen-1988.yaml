    Information about Mr. Mohsen Bidgoli has been drawn from two electronics
    form sent to Omid by individuals familiar with the case. Mr. Bidgoli
    attended the University for Military Officers and was a vice-admiral in
    the Iranian Navy. He was also a member of the Tudeh Party. Mr. Mohsen
    Bidgoli is one of 1000 people listed in a UN Human Rights Commission’s
    Special Representative’s Report, “Names and particulars of persons
    allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the period
    July-December 1988,” published on January 26, 1989. The report specifies
    that although 1000 names are mentioned, “in all probability” there were
    several thousand victims. The report further notes that: “most of the
    alleged victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the
    Tudeh Party, People’s Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims.” The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh’s
    ideology was Marxist Leninist and it supported the former Soviet Union’s
    policies. The Party played a major role on Iran’s political scene until it
    was banned for a second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the
    1979 Revolution, the Tudeh declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic
    Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively
    supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic
    Republic, it became the target of its attacks in 1983 when most of the
    Party’s leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention
    According to one of the electronic forms, Mr. Bidgoli was arrested in
    Tehran in 1982 and detained at Evin prison. No further information is
    available on his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Bidgoli was tried and
    condemned to 15 years imprisonment. No further information is available on
    the first trial. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that
    led to the execution of Mr. Bidgoli and thousands of other individuals in
    1988 are not known. According to existing information, there was no
    official trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who
    were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization named by the leader of
    the Islamic Republic, may have been accused of being “anti-religion” for
    not having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Bidgoli’s defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners
    noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves
    in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners
    (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed members of the
    Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic
    Republic, states that such claims “are false considering the circumstances
    in prisons; for our children faced most difficult conditions [in prison,
    with] visitation rights of once every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten
    minutes thro
