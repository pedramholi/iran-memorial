    Mr. Mohammad Kaseb Qane’ is one of 1000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission’s Special Representative’s Report, “Names and
    particulars of persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    during the period July-December 1988,” published January 26, 1989. The
    report specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, “in all
    probability” there were several thousand victims. “Most of the alleged
    victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh
    Party, People’s Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims.” Moreover, Mr. Kaseb Qane’s name is among 3208 members and
    sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information has been sent to Omid via an electronic form by a
    person familiar with this case. Mr. Kaseb Qane’ was born Astaneh Ashrafieh
    (Gilan province). He had two brothers and a sister. Arrest and detention
    There is no specific information on the defendant’s arrest and detention.
    Trial Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Kaseb Qane’ and thousands of other individuals in 1988
    are not known. According to existing information, there was no official
    trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were
    executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Kaseb Qane’s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting
    the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had
    collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes
    with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are
    false considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced
    most difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once
    every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone
    from behind the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the
    outside world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the
    truth of our claim.” Judgment The details regarding the execution sentence
    are not available. According to the Mojahedin’s book, Mr. Mohammad Kaseb
    Qane’ was hanged in Astaneh Ashrafieh on October 20, 1988. Months after
    the executions, prison authorities informed the families about the
    executions and handed in the victims’ belongings to their families. The
    bodies, however, were not returned to them. The bodies were buried in mass
    graves. Authorities warned the families of prisoners against holding
    memorial ceremonies.
