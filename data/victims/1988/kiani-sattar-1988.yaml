    A pioneer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and co-founder of Rah-e
    Kargar, he read Marx broadly and taught political philosophy in Tehran.
    Information about Mr. Sattar Kiani has been provided by two individuals
    familiar with this case, through electronic forms. Mr. Kiani, member of
    the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Keshtgar faction), was a victim of the
    mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed
    prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims
    included members or sympathizers of Marxist -Leninist organizations, such
    as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which
    opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan
    Khalq (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has
    been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims
    families, and witnesses memoirs. Mr. Kiani studied petrochemistry in
    Shiraz University and was one of the first members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) in the 1950 s. He was arrested for his political
    activities with the MKO in 1961; he was tortured and condemned to 15 years
    imprisonment. He was not released until 1978, when political prisoners
    were freed from prison. In prison, he inclined toward Marxism and after
    his release became one of the founding members of the Rah-e Kargar
    Organization. In 1983, he left this organization to join the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization (Keshtgar faction). Mr. Kiani had read extensively
    about Marxism. In 1979, he taught political philosophy in Sharif
    University of Technology in Tehran. Such classes were not part of the
    official school curriculum, but some students arranged them and taught
    other interested students. This lasted only for a short time, from after
    the 1979 Revolution until the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. The
    Cultural Revolution began after Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech in March
    1980, ordering that universities be purged of all those who opposed his
    regime and be transformed into learning environments [as opposed to
    political forums] where an all-Islamic curriculum is taught. The first
    wave of violence began on April 15, 1980, during a speech by Akbar Hashemi
    Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister
    of Interior] at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech, students
    supporting the regime took control of the University s central building
    and demanded that the university be purged of pro-Shah elements and other
    sellouts. On April 18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution issued a
    communiqu accusing political groups of converting higher education
    institutions into headquarters of discordant political activities and
    naming them as obstacles to the radical transformation of the
    universities. The communiqu gave these groups three days (Saturday April
    19 to Monday April 21) to shut down their activities in the universities.
    The Council stressed that the decision included libraries along with
    activities related to arts and sports. Political groups, which recruited
    members and had strong support in the universities, refused to evacuate.
    Before the end of the Council s deadline, serious clashes opposed leftist
    and Muslim groups, in opposition to the Islamic Associations, supported by
    security forces and paramilitary groups. These clashes, which peaked at
    the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in the death of several people
    and the wounding of hundreds of others on university campuses around the
    country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic authorities announced the
    victory of the Cultural Revolution and the closure of all universities in
    order to Islamicize the curricula. The universities remained closed for
    two years. One of the outcomes of the Cultural Revolution was the purging
    of many university professors and students based on their political
    beliefs. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist-Leninist group,
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin
    America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the organization, which had
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority considered the Islamic
    Republic a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime and supported it.
    After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted its
    members, solely because of their political beliefs. The Keshtgar faction
    (also known as 16 Azar faction) split from the Majority branch on December
    7, 1981, due to its opposition to uniting with the Tudeh Party. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Kiani and two other leaders of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization (Keshtgar faction) were arrested on October 21, 1984, by the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen from the Tohid Prison (called the Joint
    Anti-Sabotage Committee before the Revolution, where the Ebr
