    Ms. Maliheh Aqvami, daughter of Ali Asghar, is among 3208 members and
    sympathizers of the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose
    execution was reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity. This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran
    website. Additional information is drawn from her handwritings from the
    Prison. Ms. Aqvami's name is also on the list of the victims of the
    1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners published in a November 2,
    1989 United Nations Report of the Economic and Social Council on the
    Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, prepared by Mr.
    Reynaldo Galindo Pohl (El Salvador), Special Representative of the
    Commission on Human Rights. Executed prisoners were mostly members or
    sympathizers of the People s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, or other
    Marxist Leninist organizations such as, the People s Fedayin of Iran, the
    Tudeh Party, and the Peykar Organization. Arrest and detention No specific
    information is available on Ms. Aqvami's arrest and detention. Trial Ms.
    Aqvami was tried on August 4, 1988 at 3:00 pm. There is no further
    information available on her trial. However, relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is the proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners;
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMIO's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available regarding the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense
    In their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants
    were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the
    assertion that prisoners were associated with guerillas operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed during the past seven
    years that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed
    them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such
    conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that these
    prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside Iran.
    Judgment Ms. Malieh Aqvami was sentenced to death on August 4, 1988.
    According to her handwriting they took her for execution on the same day
    at 7:00 pm. According to her gave's information, she was executed on
    August 06, 1988. She was only 26 years old.
