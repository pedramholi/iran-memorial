    The information about Mr. Farhad Farnia was taken from the website of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). He was born in Babol in 1959. He was
    an elementary school graduate and a sympathizer of the MKO. In 1980, he
    became familiar with MKO supporting the Organization both financially and
    logistically. After the demonstration of June 20, 1981, he was arrested
    and detained for six months. Then, he continued his activity in a
    resistance cell. In an effort to join the MKO, he went to a border area in
    May 1987. After completing a training course, he was joined the Fighting
    Battalions. According to the MKO website, he participated in several armed
    operations against the forces of the Islamic Republic. The demonstration
    of June 20, 1981, took place in protest against the parliament’s
    impeachment of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic’s systematic
    policy of excluding the MKO from the country’s political scene, the
    refusal of Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO leaders and his insistence
    to disarm. Until that time, the MKO had supported the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to function within the framework of the new
    political system. However, on June 20, 1981, the Organization officially
    changed its policy and tried to overthrow the regime by organizing mass
    demonstrations all over the country. The government backlash to these
    demonstrations was severe suppression resulting in the killing of dozens
    of demonstrators. Afterwards there was a wave of mass arrests and
    executions by the Revolutionary Guards and para-military forces that
    targeted all opposition groups. The massive repression, unprecedented in
    the history of the Islamic Republic, legitimized the months-old policy of
    state harassment and suppression of dissidents and resulted in the banning
    of all forms of independent political dissent. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    According to the MKO website, Mr. Farhad Farnia was injured and arrested
    during an armed clash with the forces of the Islamic Republic in 1988.

    Farhad Farnia was hanged in Babol in 1988. The MKO website has no
    information about the exact date of his execution. According to this
    source, the family of Mr. Farhad Farnia was informed of his death only
    after his execution.
