    Mr. Anusheh Taheri was a victim of the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and
    witnesses’ memoirs. The information about Mr. Anusheh Taheri is taken from
    the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party
    Publications. He was born in Ahvaz in 1958. He was a student at the
    Science and Technology University and a member of the Tudeh Party. He was
    expelled from the university during the "Cultural Revolution". The
    Cultural Revolution began after Ayatollah Khomeini gave a speech in March
    1980 and ordered that universities be purged of all those who opposed his
    regime and be transformed into “learning environments” [as opposed to
    political forums] where “an all-Islamic curriculum” is taught. The first
    wave of violence began on April 15, 1980 during a speech by Akbar Hashemi
    Rafsanjani [a member of the Council of the Islamic Revolution and Minister
    of Interior] at the University of Tabriz. Following the speech, students
    supporting the regime took control of the University’s central building
    and demanded that the “university be purged” from “pro-Shah elements and
    other sellouts.” On April 18, the Council of the Islamic Revolution issued
    a communiqué accusing political groups of converting higher education
    institutions into “headquarters of discordant political activities” and
    naming them as obstacles to the radical transformation of the
    universities. The communiqué gave these groups three days (Saturday April
    19 to Monday April 21) to shut down their activities in the universities.
    The Council stressed that the decision included libraries along with
    activities related to arts and sports Serious clashes opposing the
    Islamist associations, sometimes supported by security forces and
    paramilitary groups, to leftist opposition groups started before the end
    of the Council’s deadline. The latter, who recruited members and had
    strong support in the universities, refused to evacuate. These clashes,
    which peaked at the end of the three-day deadline, resulted in the death
    of several people and the wounding of hundreds of others on university
    campuses around the country. On April 21, the Islamic Republic authorities
    announced the victory of the Cultural Revolution and the closure of all
    universities in order to Islamicize the curricula. The universities
    remained closed for two years. One of the outcomes of the Cultural
    Revolution was the purging of many university professors and students
    based on their political beliefs. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in
    1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported
    policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in
    Iran’s political scene until it was banned for the second time following
    the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party’s leaders and members
    were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Anusheh Taheri was
    arrested along with one of his friends on a street on April 27, 1983.
    Trial Mr. Anusheh Taheri was tried and condemned to eight years
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Taheri and thousands of other individuals in 1988
    are not known. According to existing information, there was no official
    trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were
    executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to
