    Information about Mr. Qasem Dianat was gathered from an electronic form
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with this case. Mr.
    Qasem Dianat is also listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were reported in a book
    titled Crime Against Humanity . He is also one of 1,000 people identified
    in a UN Human Rights Commission Special Representative s Report published
    on January 26, 1989. The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional
    information regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports from human rights organizations, interviews with the
    witnesses, and victims families, as well as from the Bidaran website. *
    Mr. Qasem Dianat was born in Tehran. He was a high school graduate,
    single, and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. His mother
    took care of him and his three brothers. According to the electronic form,
    Mr. Qasem Dianat was a member of the Payam Monotheist Association. After
    this association was dissolved, he and some others who shared the same
    views had gatherings in a house in Naziabad, Tehran, where he was first
    arrested, along with ninety others, in 1980. He was released after a
    while. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam to be their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the
    1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and to recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, whether by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic s
    leaders. ** Arrest and Detention Mr. Qasem Dianat was arrested for the
    second time in Kurdistan when he intended to exit the country. No specific
    information is available on his arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on Mr. Qasem Dianat s trial. According to the testimonies of
    some of the political prisoners who were tried during the executions of
    the summer of 1988 in Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the trials took place
    in a room on the ground floor of the prison, after a few weeks of
    isolation, during which prisoners were deprived of visitation, television
    and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and September, a
    three-member delegation composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor,
    Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge, and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi,
    the representative of the Ministry of Information asked prisoners
    questions about their views on the Mojahedin, whether they would renounce
    their beliefs, and if they were ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin.
    Based on what the answers were, the prisoners would have been charged with
    counter-revolutionary, anti-religion and anti-Islam, or associated with
    military action or with various [opposition] groups based near the
    borders, and would be sentenced to death. The authorities never informed
    prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious implications of
    their responses. According to survivors, during the summer of 1988, a
    large number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or leftist
    groups were executed for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to the Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they
    argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of
    their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these
    prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were
    either serving or had already completed when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges According to the electronic form, the charges
    against Mr. Qasem Dianat, after his sec
