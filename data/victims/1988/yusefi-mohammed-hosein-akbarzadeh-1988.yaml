    Mr. Mohammed Hossein Akbarzadeh Yusefi is one of 1,000 people identified
    in a UN Human Rights Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names
    and Particulars of Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of
    Iran during the Period July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989.
    The report specifies that although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all
    probability" there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged
    victims were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). However,
    members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar,
    and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among the
    alleged victims." Mr. Akbarzadeh Yusefi is also listed among 3,208 members
    and sympathizers of the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO)
    whose execution was reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    against Humanity. This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran and
    PMOI websites. According to the MKO website, Mr. Akbarzadeh Yusefi was
    born in Tabriz. He was a pharmacist and a MKO sympathizer. He was a young
    man during Dr. Mosadeq’s government and joined the National Movement at
    the time. He was imprisoned several times after the coup d'etat of August
    19, 1953. He was not politically active until the Revolution, but always
    helped people in any way that he could. After the Revolution, he supported
    the MKO by raising funds. In 1981, when the MKO members were suppressed by
    the regime, his pharmacy was the support center for all the operating
    teams in Tabriz. He was popular especially among the people in the Duchi
    quarter of Tabriz. He again used his influence to raise funds for the MKO.
    His only child, Naser, was killed during an armed struggle against the
    regime’s forces. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown. According to the MKO
    website, Mr. Akbarzadeh Yusefi was in regular contact with MKO supporters
    outside Iran. In his last assignment, he went to Turkey to receive new
    orders, but the government officials were alerted of this mission. He was
    arrested on his way back to Iran in 1988 and detained for five months.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant's trail. According to
    the MKO website, Mr. Mohammad Hossein Akbarzadeh Yusefi was not tried and
    sentenced in court. Charges No information is available on Mr. Akbarzadeh
    Yusefi’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains
    no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No information is
    available about the defendant’s defence. Judgment No specific information
    is available about the defendant’s execution. According to the MKO
    website, Mr. Akbarzadeh Yusefi was hanged in public in Tabriz during the
    mass killing of political prisoners in August 1988.
