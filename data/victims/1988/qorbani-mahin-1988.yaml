    Information about Ms. Mahin Qarbani has been provided by an former
    cellmate, via an electronic form. Ms. Qorbani is among 3208 members and
    sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO, also PMIO) whose
    execution was reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity . This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Arrest and detention Ms. Qorbani was
    arrested in 1981. The details of her arrest are not known. She was kept in
    Evin, Qezelhesar, and Gohardasht prisons. Due to her complaints against
    the mistreatment of prisoners by guards and those prisoners who had
    recanted their previous political activism, Ms. Qorbani spent most of her
    imprisonment in cells, where the conditions were particularly harsh in
    order to “punish” the prisoners. She had been arrested due to her
    affiliation with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, but toward the end of
    her life, she no longer believed in their principles. She did not pray and
    tried to distance herself from other Mojahedin sympathizers, who were
    imprisoned with her. She was alone most of the time. In the last year
    before her execution, despite her youth she looked aged, with her face
    wrinkled and her hair grey. Trial Ms. Qorbani was tried and condemned to
    10 years imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials
    that led to the execution of Ms. Qorbani and thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney and
    prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Qorbani’s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting
    the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had
    collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes
    with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims “are
    false considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced
    most difficult conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once
    every 15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone
    from behind the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the
    outside world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the
    truth of our claim.” Judgment According to her cellmate, Ms. Mahin Qorbani
    was the last individual, affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization,
    who was taken from section 3 of women’s ward and never returned. Before
    her name was called, she was worried that she may not be called. She did
    not want to be differentiated from other MKO sympathizers, even though she
