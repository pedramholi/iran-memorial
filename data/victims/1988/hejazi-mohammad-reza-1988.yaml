    Mr. Mohammad Reza Hejazi is listed among 3208 members and sympathizers of
    the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran website and the web site
    of the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization. Information about the mass
    executions has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir
    of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews
    with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Mr. Mohammad Reza Hejazi was tried and condemned to prison term.
    There is no information about the trail sessions or its location. Also,
    specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Hejazi and thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not
    known. According to existing information, there was no official trial with
    the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in
    1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a
    representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of
    Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about
    their beliefs and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges No charge has been publicly levelled against the defendant.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the
    PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war
    against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available about the defense. In their
    open letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not
    given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion
    that prisoners were associated with guerrillas’ operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed during the past seven
    years that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed
    them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such
    conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that these
    prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside Iran.
    Judgment No specific information is available about the defendant’s
    execution. According to the website of the Mojahedin Khalq, while it was
    two yeas after the completion of his prison term, Mr. Mohammad Reza Hejazi
    was hanged during the mass killings of the political prisoners on July 31,
    1988.
