    Mr. Seifollah Qiasvand is one of the victims of the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). In addition to members
    of those Marxist-Leninist organizations opposed to the Islamic Republic,
    activists of organizations that were not against the Islamic Republic were
    also among the victims of these mass killings. Mr. Seifollah Qiasvand s
    name is also mentioned as one of 1000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and
    particulars of persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    during the period July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The
    report specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, "in all
    probability" there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged
    victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh
    Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims." Additional information about Mr. Seifollah Qiasvand is taken
    from the book The Tudeh Martyrs by The Tudeh Party of Iran Publications.
    He was born in Nahavand, Gilan province. He was a physician and a First
    Lieutenant in the Army. After the revolution, when he was the commander of
    the hospital battalion of the Armored Brigade 92 in Ahvaz, he joined the
    Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party
    ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported the former Soviet Union's
    policies. The Party played a major role in Iran's political scene until it
    was banned for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After
    the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic
    Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively
    supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic
    Republic, it became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of
    the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Mr.
    Seifollah Qiasvand was arrested in his office in Tehran in May, 1983. His
    was imprisoned in Qezelhesar, Komiteh Moshtarak, and Gohardasht prisons.
    According to the above source, his hand was broken in three places as a
    result of severe torture including being lashed with cable, contortion,
    and suspension in the air. Contortion is a method of handcuffing. One hand
    is placed over the shoulder and cuffed with the other hand. The pressure
    may be so much as to break the shoulder blades. For more painful effects,
    the body is may be suspended in the air. Trial Mr. Seifollah Qiasvand was
    tried and condemned to life imprisonment. There is no information about
    the trial. There is no specific information about any such trials that
    condemned thousands of political prisoners to death in a few months
    period. According to the available information, the Iranian authorities
    did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with in the
    presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed in 1988 had
    been questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of a
    religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the
    Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about
    their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly levelled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who
    do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also "waging war against God" and should be sentence
