    Information about Mr. Hossein Ma sumi was gathered from an electronic form
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with this case. Mr.
    Hossein Ma sumi is also listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were reported by the
    organization in a book titled Crime Against Humanity . He is also one of
    1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission Special
    Representative s Report published on January 26, 1989. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families,
    as well as from the Bidaran website. * Mr. Hossein Ma sumi, son of Ahmad,
    was born in Baft, Kerman. He was a high school student and a sympathizer
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of
    Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of
    Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in armed struggle against the
    Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic
    and social analysis but considered Islam to be their source of
    inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened
    when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following
    a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology
    and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members
    purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led
    to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January
    of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along
    with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to
    recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution
    and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, weather by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic s leaders. ** Arrest and Detention Mr.
    Hossein Ma sumi was arrested at a house belonging to one of his comrades.
    He was only 14 or 15 years old when arrested. His family had no news of
    him and it took his mother more than two years before she could visit her
    son at Vakilabad Prison in Mashhad. He was about to be executed a few
    months after his arrest; however, due to international objections to the
    execution of individuals under 18-years-of-age in the Islamic Republic,
    his execution was postponed. According to the electronic form, Mr. Hossein
    Ma sumi had a few days in which to visit his family. During this period,
    he was connected with a made-up group - supposedly related to the
    Mojahedin Khalq - and arrested. During his years of detention, he was
    tortured so severely that his face was unrecognizable. When his younger
    brother visited him in the prison, after three years, he could not
    recognize Mr. Ma sumi and had to ask him about some childhood memories to
    make sure he was his brother. (Mr. Ma sumi s brother would also be
    executed several years later.) International laws have strictly prohibited
    capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time
    of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offense committed before the
    age of eighteen. Trial No information is available regarding Mr. Hossein
    Ma sumi s trial. According to the testimonies of some of the political
    prisoners who were tried during the executions of the summer of 1988. In
    some of the prisons, the trials took place in a room in the prison, after
    a few weeks of isolation, during which prisoners were deprived of
    visitations, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August
    and September, a three-member delegation composed of the public
    prosecutor, a religious judge, and a representative of the Ministry of
    Information asked prisoners questions about their views on the Mojahedin,
    whether they would renounce their beliefs, and if they were ready to
    cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the
    prisoners would have been charged with counter revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam as well as being associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders, and
    would be sentenced to death. The authorities never informed prisoners
    about the delegation s purpose and the serious implications of their resp
