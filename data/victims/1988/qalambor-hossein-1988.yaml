    Mr. Hossein Qalambor is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission s Special Representative s Report, Names and Particulars
    of Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran from July
    through December 1988, published January 26, 1989. The report specifies
    that although 1,000 names are mentioned, in all probability there were
    several thousand victims. Most of the alleged victims were members of the
    Mojahedin (MKO). However, members of the Tudeh Party, People s Fedaiyan
    Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization as well as 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims. The information about Mr.
    Hossein Qalambor is taken from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of
    Iran by the Tudeh Party Publications. He was born in Ahvaz in 1952. In
    1971, he was admitted to Tehran University of Technology where he majored
    in electrical engineering. In 1972, during the demonstration against US
    President Richard Nixon s visit to Iran, he was arrested and condemned to
    one-year imprisonment. After his release, he joined the Fedaiyan Khalq
    Organization and went underground in 1974. In 1976, along with some
    others, he parted from Fedaiyan Khalq and joined the Tudeh Party. After a
    while, he became an advisor to the Central Committee of the Tudeh Party.
    The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The
    Tudeh Party played a major role in Iran s political scene until it was
    banned for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the
    1979 Revolution, the Tudeh Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the
    Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively
    supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic
    Republic, it became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of
    the Party leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    details of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Mr.
    Hossein Qalambor was arrested in May, 1983. He was taken to Evin prison.
    According to the above book, he was held there in solitary confinement for
    several months. Trial Mr. Hossein Qalambor was tried and condemned to life
    imprisonment. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led
    to the execution of Mr. Qalambor and thousands of other individuals in
    1988 are not known. According to existing information, there was no
    official trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who
    were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations that may have led to their execution. These
    accusations include being counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An edict of the Leader
    of the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri,
    his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the MKO members as hypocrites who do not believe in Islam and
    wage war against God and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the
    positions taken by this organization are also waging war against God and
    should be sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not belong to the MKO
    may have been accused of being anti-religion for not having renounced his
    or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, the
    families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Visits were limite
