    Mr. Ali Taikandi, son of Abbas, born in Tehran in 1964, was a victim of
    the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the
    executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other
    victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Information about
    the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the
    memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations,
    interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs. The information
    about Mr. Taikandi has been sent to Omid by an individual familiar with
    this case, via an electronic form. Mr. Taikandi is also mentioned in Dr.
    Masud Ansari’s book 67 Massacre . According to the available information,
    Mr. Taikandi’s brother, Reza, was executed in 1983. Arrest and detention
    There is no detail on the defendant’s arrest and detention, other than Mr.
    Ali Taikandi, was arrested in a street meeting, after his brother’s arrest
    in 1982. He was transferred to one of the prisons in Tehran province.
    Trial No detail is available on Mr. Taikandi’s first trial. He was tried
    and condemned to imprisonment. At the time of his execution in 1988, he
    had served his prison term, but due to the fact that he refused to
    denounce his political organization and recant his political beliefs, he
    was not freed from prison (electronic form). Specific details on the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Taikandi and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with the presence of an
    attorney and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a
    three-man committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from
    the Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This
    committee asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs
    and whether or not they believed in God. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to
    death. Charges At his first trial, Mr. Taikandi was charged with
    “activities in the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.” No charge has been
    publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their
    letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt Based on the available information, an individual’s
    confession had been used as evidence against Mr. Taikandi. International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the
    case of political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised.
    The National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners
    plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their
    political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations
    have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those
    prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Taikandi’s defense. He was denied the right to have an attorney. In their
    open letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not
    given the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter,
    rebutting the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had
    collaborated wi
