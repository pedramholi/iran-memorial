    Information regarding Mr. Ashtari’s arrest, trial and execution was drawn
    from two electronic forms sent to the Boroumand Foundation by his
    relatives. Mr. Mehrdad Ashtari is among 3208 members and sympathizers of
    the People’s Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs.
    Mr. Ashtari is also one of 1000 people listed in a UN Human Rights
    Commission’s Special Representative’s Report, “Names and particulars of
    persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the
    period July-December 1988,” published on January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, “in all probability”
    there were several thousand victims. The report further notes that: “most
    of the alleged victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of
    the Tudeh Party, People’s Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims.” Mr. Ashtari was sentenced to ten years in prison, but he was
    executed almost 8 years after arrest. Arrest and detention Mr. Ashtari was
    reportedly arrested after the Revolutionary Guards learned about his
    political activities through a friend who had been arrested a day earlier.
    He was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards at Narmak in Tehran on October
    5, 1980 at 2 p.m. The Guards had no arrest warrant; he was first taken to
    Evin Prison and later transferred to the Gohardasht Prison. He was denied
    access to an attorney. He was allowed monthly visits with his family,
    after his first year of detention. He was reportedly tortured during
    interrogations and his feet were beaten so severely that the prison
    doctors had to perform surgery on them. Trial Mr. Ashtari was tried once
    around April 1981 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. The circumstances
    of this trial are mostly unknown. The defendant had disclosed to others
    that he had a 5-minute trial, without the presence of a legal
    representative or access to his files prior to the trial. He was also not
    given an appeal date. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials
    that led to the execution of Mr. Ashtari and thousands of other
    individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney and
    prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Ashtari’s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting
    the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had c
