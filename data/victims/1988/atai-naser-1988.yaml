    Mr. Naser Ata’i, a member of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, Majority
    faction, was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988.
    The majority of the executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Other victims included members or sympathizers of
    Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and
    the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as
    the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not.
    Information about the mass executions has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports by human rights
    organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and witnesses’ memoirs.
    A friend from university sent the information about Mr, Ata’i to Omid .
    Complementary information has been drawn from an interview from a person
    from the same political organization as well as from the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Majority) website. Mr. Ata’i was born in Bam (in the province of Kerman)
    in 1952. He went to school in Bam until he enrolled in Tehran University
    and moved to the capital in 1972. As a student, he was an activist and
    organized activities. Meanwhile, he became a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization. He liked hiking and went hiking with other students.
    He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in sociology. After the 1979
    Revolution, Mr. Ata’i returned to Bam, started to work as a teacher, and
    became a member of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. When the organization
    split, he was affiliated with the Majority branch. When repression of
    political dissent intensified in 1981, Mr. Ata’i discovered that there
    were plans for his assassination in Bam. Consequently, he left Bam and
    moved to Tehran once again, where he continued his political activities.
    He married and had a daughter. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. After the 1979 Revolution, the
    organization, which renounced armed struggle, split over their support of
    the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority
    supported and considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and
    anti-imperialist regime. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic
    Republic targeted its members solely because of their political beliefs.
    Arrest and detention Arrested in Tehran in 1986, Mr. Ata’i was
    interrogated at Tohid prison. After the interrogation period, he was
    transferred to Gohardasht prison. The Joint Anti-Sabotage Committee was
    renamed Tohid prison in the early 1980’s. This was detention center used
    for interrogation and torture of the detainees. In the early 1990’s, the
    prison became the Ebrat Museum. Trial Mr. Ata’i was tried and condemned to
    12 years imprisonment before being retried and executed. He served his
    prison term at Gohardasht prison. Specific details about the circumstances
    of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Ata’i and thousands of
    other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing
    information, there was no official trial with attorneys or prosecutors.
    Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee
    consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence
    Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the
    leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether or not
    they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in
    1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official
    secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They
    note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and
    sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already
    completed when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly stated against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities’ accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and dec
