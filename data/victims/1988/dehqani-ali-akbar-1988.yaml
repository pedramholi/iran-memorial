    Information about Mr. Ali akbar Dehqani, son of Darvish ali, was gathered
    from an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person
    familiar with this case. Mr. Ali akbar Dehqani is also listed among 3,208
    members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose
    executions were reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime
    Against Humanity* . He is also one of 1,000 people identified in a UN
    Human Rights Commission s Special Representative s Report published on
    January 26, 1989. The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional
    information regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri; reports from human rights organizations, interviews with
    witnesses and victims families; as well as from the Bidaran website.
    According to the electronic form, Mr. Ali akbar Dehqani was born in
    Tehran. He was a high school graduate and participated in meetings of the
    Freedom Movement (Nehzat-e Azadi). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as
    its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam
    was revolutionary, and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam to be their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to a
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released, along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and to
    recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution
    and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the
    leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by Islamic Republic leaders.** Arrest and Detention According to
    the electronic form sent to Omid , Mr. Ali akbar Dehqani was arrested in
    his parents house in Tehran at midnight. He was transferred to Evin Prison
    and had no access to an attorney or any visitation with his family. Trial
    Mr. Ali akbar Dehqani was condemned to seven years imprisonment during his
    first trial. No information is available on his second trial. According to
    the testimonies of some of the political prisoners who were tried during
    the executions of the summer of 1988 in Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the
    trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the prison, after a few
    weeks of isolation, during which prisoners were deprived of visitation,
    television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and
    September, a three-member delegation, composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi,
    the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge; and
    Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry of
    Information, who asked prisoners questions about their views on the
    Mojahedin, whether they would renounce their beliefs, and if they were
    ready to cooperate with the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the
    prisoners would have been charged with counter revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam or associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders and would be sentenced
    to death. The authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s
    purpose, and the serious implications of their responses. According to
    survivors, during the summer of 1988, a large number of prisoners
    sympathizing with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not
    recanting their beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners, executed in
    1988, refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then-Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges According to the
    electronic form, the charge against Mr. Ali akbar Dehqani in his first
    trial was announced as, cooperation with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    No charge has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass
