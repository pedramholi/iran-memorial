    Mr. Ahmad Ali Rasadi E’temad was a victim in the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fedaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. The information about Mr. Rasadi E’temad
    is taken from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by the Tudeh
    Party of Iran Publications. He graduated from the Military College in 1936
    and joined the Tudeh Party in 1944. A year later, after the defeat of the
    Officers Uprising in Khorasan, he joined the Democrat Party in Azarbaijan.
    With the suppression of this movement, he went abroad and earned a PhD in
    Economics. After the Revolution, he returned to Iran and continued his
    political activities as a member of the Central Committee of the Tudeh
    Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Party ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies the former Soviet Union. The
    Party played a major role in Iran’s political scene until it was banned
    for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the
    new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The details of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Ahmad Ali Rasadi
    E’temad was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards in February, 1983. Trial
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Rasadi E’temad and thousands of other individuals in 1988
    are not known. According to existing information, there was no official
    trial with the presence of an attorney and prosecutor. Those who were
    executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly
    leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters
    to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur
    visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Defendants, who did not belong to the Organization named by the leader of
    the Islamic Republic, may have been accused of being “anti-religion” for
    not having renounced his or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense In their open letter, the families of the prisoners noted that
    defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court.
    The same letter, rebutting the accusation that these prisoners (from
    inside the prison) had collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin
    Organization in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states
    that such claims “are false considering the circumstances in prisons; for
    our children faced most difficult conditions
