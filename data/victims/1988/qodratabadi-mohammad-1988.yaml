    Mr. Mohammad Qodratabadi is among 3208 members and sympathizers of the
    People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Complementary information about the mass executions of 1988-89 has been
    gathered from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with family members, and memoirs of witnesses by
    the Boroumand Foundation. Additional information about Mr. Qodrat Abadi
    has been drawn from the Bidaran website as well as Omid electronic form,
    sent by a relative of his. He was born in Tehran, was married and
    daughter. He held a master’s degree in mathematics and worked at the
    Ministry of Education of District 10 of Tehran. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Qodrat Abadi was arrested at his father’s house located on Hashemi street
    in Tehran. The circumstances and date of the arrest are not known. Trial
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Mr. Qodrat Abadi and thousands of other individuals in 1988
    are not known. According to the available information, the Iranian
    authorities did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court
    with in the presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed
    in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member special committee, composed
    of a religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and
    the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners
    about their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been publicly leveled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners –
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khoemini, reproduced in the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the reported
    claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In this
    edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who
    do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to death.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on his defense. In their open letter, the
    families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the
    opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the
    accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated
    with armed members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed
    forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claim “are false
    considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children faced most
    difficult conditions [in the prison, with] visitation rights of once every
    15 days, each visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone from
    behind the glass window, and were deprived of any connection with the
    outside world. We faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the
    truth of our claim.” Judgment The details regarding the execution sentence
    are not available. According to available information, leftist prisoners
    executed in 1988 were found to be “apostates.” Months after the
    executions, prison authorities informed the families about the executions
    and handed in the victims’ belongings to their families. The bodies,
    however, were not returned to them. The bodies were buried in mass graves.
    Authorities warned the families of prisoners against holding memorial
    ceremonies.
