    Mr. Mehdi Zamani is a victim in the mass killings of political prisoners
    in 1988. Many of the executed prisoners were members or sympathizers of
    the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI, also known as MKO).
    However, members or supporters of Marxist Leninist organizations such as,
    the People’s Fedayian of Iran (Minority) or Peykar, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and Fadayian Khalq
    (Majority), which did not oppose the regime, were among the victims.
    Complementary information has been gathered from the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with family
    members, and memoirs of witnesses by the Boroumand Foundation. The
    information about Mr. Mehdi Zamani is taken from the book The Martyrs of
    the Tuden Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party Publications. He was a member
    of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh
    Party ideology was Marxist- Leninist and it supported policies of the
    former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran's political
    scene until it was banned for the second time following the August 19,
    1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah
    Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks from 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members
    were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Mr. Mehdi Zamani was
    tried and condemned to two years imprisonment. Whether or not a second
    trial condemned him to death is not known. According to the available
    information, the Iranian authorities did not try the victims of the 1988
    mass execution in a court with in the presence of a defense lawyer. The
    prisoners who were executed in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member
    special committee, composed of a religious judge, a representative of the
    Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned
    the leftist prisoners about their beliefs and their faith in God and
    religion. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice
    Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed serving at the
    time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge was ever
    publicly levelled against the victims of the 1988 mass execution. In their
    letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the accusations against the prisoners that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced
    in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor,
    corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against the
    executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMOI's
    members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against
    God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken
    by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. It is possible that the prisoners who were members of
    other political organizations were charge for being "anti religious" and
    condemned for insisting on their beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense In their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that
    defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court.
    Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces
    operating near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their
    relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our children lived in
    most difficult conditions. Our visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a
    glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. Over the past seven
    years we witnessed that they were denied access to anything that would
    have allowed them to establish contacts outside their prison walls." Under
    such conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that
    these prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside
    Iran. Judgment No specific information is available about the death
    sentence. Mr. Mehdi Zamani was hanged during the mass killings of
