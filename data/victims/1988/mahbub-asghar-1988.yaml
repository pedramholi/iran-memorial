    Information about Mr. Asghar Mahbub, son of Mohammad, was sent to the
    Boroumand Foundation by a relative and a friend familiar with his case.
    His name is also taken from the book, Those Who Said No, published in 1999
    in Paris by the Association for the Defense of Political Prisoners and
    Prisoners of Conscience in Iran. He was a victim of the mass killings of
    political prisoners in 1988. The Boroumand Foundation has collected
    additional information regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of
    Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human rights organizations, interviews
    with the witnesses and victims families, as well as from the Bidaran and
    Rah-e Tudeh websites. The majority of the executed prisoners were members
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Mr. Asghar Mahbub was born in Kashan on April 10, 1946. He
    was married and a professor at the School of Dramatic Arts in Tehran
    University. He was partially educated in Germany. He was an active member
    of the Tudeh Party who was first in charge of the party in Karaj and later
    participated in the propaganda department of the party in Tehran. The
    Tudeh Party of Iran ( Hezbe Tudeh or the Party of the Masses) was founded
    in 1941 by a group of mostly communist intellectuals. Its non-radical
    reformist platform and its name reflected the founders hopes to attract
    the larger religious population. However, the Party's Marxist-Leninist
    orientation and its anti-Imperialist and anti-Fascist positions made it
    most influential among intellectuals and educated Iranians. In the late
    1940s and early 1950s, The Tudeh , with its country-wide organization,
    including active women, youth, and labor groups, as well as a secret
    military network ( Sazman-e Nezami-ye Hezb-e Tudeh Iran ), played a major
    role in Iran s political scene. The Tudeh was banned following an
    attempted assassination against the Shah in 1949. Nonetheless, the Party
    continued its activities, as well as its publications, of which there
    would be many. Following the 19 August 1953 coup, the Tudeh s military
    network was annihilated and many of its leaders arrested or forced into
    exile, mostly in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Over the years, the
    Party s political influence diminished, due to the various splits
    resulting from its pro-Soviet stand and policies in periods of political
    tension in Iran and from the radicalization of the left in the 1960s and
    1970s. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh declared Ayatollah Khomeini
    and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and
    actively supported and collaborated with the government. Though the Party
    never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of its attacks in
    1982, and the Party's leaders and many members, including those of the new
    secret military network, were arrested. The Tudeh lost scores of its
    members during the mass prison killing of 1988. Following several splits,
    the Party resumed its activities in the early 1990s in exile. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Asghar Mahbub was arrested, along with his wife, his
    sisters, and his brother-in-law, in Tehran, on April 27, 1983. He was
    taken to the Joint Anti-Sabotage Committee and later to Gohardasht Prison
    in Karaj. Only rarely was he allowed to have visitors. According to the
    Rah-e Tudeh website, he was amazingly able to give energy to prisoners and
    make them laugh. He was one of the funniest prisoners. Trial Mr. Asghar
    Mahbub was tried and sentenced to seven years in prison in 1983. Specific
    details about the circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of
    Mr. Mahbub are unknown. No information is available about the trial
    sessions. According to the testimonies of leftist political prisoners who
    were tried in Gohardasht Prison during the executions of the summer of
    1988, the trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the prison
    after a few weeks of isolation during which prisoners were deprived of
    visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. Toward the
    end of August, a three-member delegation composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi,
    the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge; and
    Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry of
    Information, asked prisoners questions about whether they were Muslim or
    Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were practicing
    Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the latter were sentenced to be
    hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The authorities never
    informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and the serious
    implications of their responses. According to survivors, during the summer
    of 1988 a large number of prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or
    Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their belief
