    The information about Mr. Mojtaba Mohseni is based on an interview with
    his brother. He was born in Arak, an agriculture student at Karaj
    University, married, and a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization
    (Azar 16). The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group,
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin
    America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the Organization, which had
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority considered the
    Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime and
    supported it. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic
    targeted its members solely because of their political beliefs. The
    Keshtgar faction (also known as 16 Azar faction) split from the Majority
    branch on December 7, 1981, due to its opposition to uniting with the
    Tudeh Party. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Mojtaba Mohseni
    s arrest and detention are not known. He was arrested in Esfehan in 1984.
    According to the interviewee, his house was surrounded during the night
    and when he left the house for work in the morning, he was arrested. He
    was detained at Esfehan prison, and interrogated in Ahvaz and Esfehan. He
    was denied the right to have an attorney and had some visitations with his
    family once a month and sometimes every two months. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges No detailed information is
    available on Mr. Mohseni s charges. According to the interviewee, his
    charge was announced as, membership of the Central Committee of the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Azar 16). Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available about
    Mr. Mohseni s defense. Judgment No specific information is available about
    the execution sentence. According to the interviewee, Mr. Mojtaba Mohseni
    was condemned to death, but he was supposed to be released. However, he
    was executed in Esfehan in December, 1988. His family was only informed of
    his burial location. It is possible that he was a victim of the mass
    execution of political prisoners in that year.
