    Mr. Saber Mohammadzadeh is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human
    Rights Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and
    Particulars of Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    from July through December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, "in all probability"
    there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were
    members of the Mojahedin (MKO). However, members of the Tudeh Party,
    People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization as
    well as 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged victims." The
    information about Mr. Saber Mohammadzadeh is taken from the book The Tudeh
    Martyrs by The Tudeh Party of Iran Publications. He was born in Noshahr,
    Gilan province. He was a member of the Tudeh Party. He was forced to drop
    out of high school to work. In April 1952, he joined the Youth
    Organization of the Tudeh Party. In 1957, he began working as a lathe
    operator. In 1967, he was arrested and condemned to seven years
    imprisonment for working in the underground publishing house of the Party.
    After his prison term was over, he was tried again and condemned to an
    additional 12 years imprisonment. However, he was released during the
    revolution in 1979. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The
    Tudeh's ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the
    former Soviet Union. The Tudeh Party played a major role in Iran's
    political scene until it was banned for the second time following the
    August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh Party declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks beginning in 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and
    members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The detailed circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Saber
    Mohammadzadeh was arrested on February 6, 1983. His was detained at both
    Evin and Joint Committee prisons. Trial Mr. Saber Mohammadzadeh was
    initially tried and condemned to imprisonment. There is no information
    about this trial, just as there is no specific information about any such
    trials that condemned thousands of political prisoners to death in just a
    few months period. According to the available information, the Iranian
    authorities did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court
    with in the presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners who were executed
    in 1988 had been questioned by a three-member special committee, composed
    of a religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and
    the Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners
    about their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    1988 open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that
    the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was ever publicly levelled against
    the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of
    the victims refer to the accusations that may have led to their execution.
    These accusations include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and
    anti-Islam," as well as being "associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict from the
    Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ruhollah Khomeini, reproduced in the
    memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated successor, corroborates the
    reported claims regarding the charges against the executed prisoners. In
    this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMIO's members as
    "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war against God" and
    decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this
    organization are also "waging war against God" and should be sentenced to
    death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available about
    his defense. In their open letter, the families of the prisoners note that
    defendants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves in court.
    Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces
    operating near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their
    relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our children lived in
    most difficult conditions. All visits were limited
