    Information about Mr. Abbas Hasheminejad, son of Seyyed Morteza, was
    gathered from an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a
    person familiar with this case. Further information concerning Mr. Abas
    Hasheminejad, an affiliate of the Tudeh Party, is also taken from the book
    Those Who Said No, published in 1999, in Paris, by the Association for the
    Defense of Political Prisoners and Prisoners of Conscience in Iran. He was
    a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in 1988. The
    Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information regarding the
    1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with witnesses and victims families, as
    well as from the Bidaran website. The majority of the executed prisoners
    were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included
    members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the
    Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the
    Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Majority), which did not. Mr. Abbas Hasheminejad was born in
    Chaharcheshmeh in 1947. He was single, had graduated from the Military
    College and also graduated in electronic engineering from a college in the
    US. He was a navy officer, a logistics commander in Mahshahr, and a member
    of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran ( Hezbe Tudeh or the Party of
    the Masses) was founded in 1941 by a group of mostly communist
    intellectuals. Its non-radical reformist platform and its name reflected
    the founders hopes to attract the larger religious population. However,
    the Party's Marxist-Leninist orientation and its anti-Imperialist and
    anti-Fascist positions made it most influential among intellectuals and
    educated Iranians. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, The Tudeh , with its
    country-wide organization, including active women, youth, and labor
    groups, as well as a secret military network ( Sazman-e Nezami-ye Hezb-e
    Tudeh Iran ), played a major role in Iran s political scene. The Tudeh was
    banned, following an attempted assassination against the Shah in 1949.
    Nonetheless, the Party continued its activities, as well as its
    publications, of which there would be many. Following the 19 August 1953
    coup, the Tudeh s military network was annihilated and many of its leaders
    arrested or forced into exile, mostly in the Soviet Union and Eastern
    Europe. Over the years, the Party s political influence diminished, due to
    the various splits resulting from its pro-Soviet stand and policies in
    periods of political tension in Iran and from the radicalization of the
    left in the 1960s and 1970s. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported and collaborated with the
    government. Though the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became
    the target of its attacks in 1982, and the Party's leaders and many
    members, including those of the new secret military network, were
    arrested. The Tudeh lost scores of its members during the mass prison
    killing of 1988. Following several splits, the Party resumed its
    activities in the early 1990s, in exile. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Hasheminejad was arrested in Mahshahr in May of 1983. He was transferred
    to the Komite-Moshtarak prison. There is no specific information on his
    arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Hasheminejad was tried and condemned to
    five years imprisonment in Tehran. This ruling was confirmed by the
    appeals court. Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that
    led to the execution of Mr. Hasheminejad are unknown. No information is
    available about the trial sessions. According to the testimony of leftist
    political prisoners, who were tried in Gohardasht Prison during the
    executions of the summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room on the
    ground floor of the prison after a few weeks of isolation, during which
    prisoners were deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts,
    and outdoor time. Toward the end of August, a three-member delegation
    composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri,
    the religious judge; and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of
    the Ministry of Information; asked prisoners questions about whether they
    were Muslim or Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were
    practicing Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the latter were
    sentenced to be hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The
    authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and
    the serious implications of their responses. According to survivors,
    during the summer of 1988 a large number of prisoners sympathizing with
    the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their
    beliefs. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
