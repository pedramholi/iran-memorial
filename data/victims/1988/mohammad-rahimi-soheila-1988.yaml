    Soheila, daughter of Jalil, was compassionate, liked books, and loved to
    sing. Within a family of leftists, hers was a quiet commitment. The
    information about Ms. Soheila Mohammad-Rahimi, daughter of Jalil, was
    gathered from interviews with her relatives. She is among 3,208 members
    and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization whose executions were
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity .
    This book documents the 1988-1989 mass execution of political prisoners in
    Iran. She was born in Tehran on March 15, 1964. She was a senior, studying
    at Fatemeh Amini High School in Tehran and was a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Her sister, Ms. Mehrangiz Mohammad-Rahimi,
    was also one of the victims of the mass killings of political prisoners in
    1988. Her brothers, Aziz and Hushang, were executed in 1981 and 1992,
    respectively. Ms. Mohammad-Rahimi was arrested for the first time on July
    29, 1981, at the age of 17, along with her father and her brother,
    Hushang, in their house by Revolutionary Guards. After spending 24 hours
    at the Ferdosi Circle Committee, she was transferred to Evin Prison. From
    behind his blindfold, the interviewee saw her, along with her father and
    her brother, in a hallway in Evin Prison a month and a half after their
    arrest. Soheila and her family members were transferred to Qezelhesar
    Prison after three months in detention at Evin Prison. In 1981, she was
    tried at Evin and condemned to 10 years in prison. While in custody, she
    lost sight in one eye. In the summer of 1986, she was pardoned, because of
    her health and eye problems. According to an interviewee, Soheila was kind
    and compassionate. She did not talk much. She liked books and loved to
    sing. She also liked sports and played volleyball. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and Detention In 1986,
    after she was released from prison, Ms. Mohammad-Rahimi decided to leave
    Iran. She and her mother were going to the Iran-Turkey border but they
    were both arrested in the city of Salmas (in the West Azarbaijan
    province). They were interrogated for one week in Salmas and then
    transferred to Evin Prison. She had some visits with her father during the
    two-year imprisonment before her execution. Trial Ms. Mohammad-Rahimi was
    tried after her second arrest and condemned to four years in prison. (Her
    mother was sentenced to two years imprisonment.) There is no specific
    information about the circumstances of the trials that condemned Ms.
    Mohammad-Rahimi and thousands of other political prisoners to death within
    a few months period in 1988. According to existing information, there was
    no official trial with the presence of an attorney or prosecutor. Those
    who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee, consisting
    of a religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and
    a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. The relatives of political prisoners
    executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted
    in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then Minister of Justice, Dr. Hassan Habibi, they argue that the official
    secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They
    note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and
    sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already
    completed serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges
