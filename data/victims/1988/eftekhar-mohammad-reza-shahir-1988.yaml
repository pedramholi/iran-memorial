    Information about Mr. Mohammad Reza Shahir Eftekhar, son of Mohammad Ali,
    was gathered from an electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a
    person familiar with this case. According to this information, he was born
    in Tehran in 1960. He was a student and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. Mr. Mohammad Reza Shahir Eftekhar is also listed among
    3,208 members and sympathizers of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose
    executions were reported by the organization in a book titled Crime
    Against Humanity . The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional
    information regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports from human rights organizations, interviews with the
    witnesses and victims families, as well as from the Bidaran website. * The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to a split with the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. ** Arrest and Detention Mr. Mohammad Reza Shahir Eftekhar was
    arrested in September of 1981. He was detained at Qezelhesar and
    Gohardasht prisons. He was active in collective activities of prisoners
    and distribution of news in Qezelhesar Prison. During this period, he was
    allowed to have weekly visitations with his mother and sisters over 30
    years of age. No specific information is available on his arrest and
    detention. Trial Mr. Mohammad Reza Shahir Eftekhar was tried and condemned
    to ten years imprisonment. On August 1, 1988, officials took him, along
    with other prisoners with convictions of over 10 years, for a second
    trial. No information is available about this trial. According to the
    testimonies of some of the political prisoners who were tried during the
    executions of the summer of 1988 in Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the
    trials took place in a room on the ground floor of the prison after a few
    weeks of isolation, during which prisoners were deprived of visitation,
    television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor time. In August and
    September, a three-member delegation -- composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi,
    the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious judge; and
    Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of the Ministry of
    Information -- asked prisoners questions about their views on the
    Mojahedin, whether they would renounce their beliefs, and if they were
    ready to cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were,
    the prisoners would have been charged as counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion and anti-Islam, or associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders, and would have been
    sentenced to death. The authorities never informed prisoners about the
    delegation s purpose and the serious implications of their responses.
    According to survivors, during the summer of 1988, a large number of
    prisoners sympathizing with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed
    for not recanting their beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    then-Minister of Justice, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge has been
    publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their
