    Information regarding the arrest and execution of Mr. Nezami has been
    collected from an electronic communication sent to the Boroumand
    Foundation, an interview with one of his relatives, Kayhan newspaper (No.
    12053, 02 January 1984), and Jomhuri Eslami newspaper (No. 1331, 02
    January 1984), which published on page 10 a report of the proceedings of
    the Military Revolutionary Tribunal that tried Mr. Nezami along with seven
    others. He is one of the victims of the massacre of political prisoners in
    1988. The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information
    regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri,
    reports from Human Rights organizations, interviews with witnesses and
    victims families, as well as the Bidaran website. Mr. Nezami, son of
    Saleh, was born in Narjabad village in Maragheh. He was married and had
    two sons. His second son was born while he was in prison. He was a senior
    student at the Tehran University Medical School. He had a scholarship from
    the army and was serving his internship at a military hospital.Mr. Nezami
    was a hiker and known to be outspoken and candid. According to fellow
    inmates, he had retained his enthusiasm for sports and was a leader, in
    this, for other prisoners. He was one of the more influential prisoners
    and was able to create morale and solidarity among his companions.
    According to his inmates, in an era when medicine was scarce in the
    prison, Mr. Nezami tried to treat other prisoners using traditional
    medicine. (ABF interview) According to a news report onMr. Nezami s trial,
    the latter has stated during his defense that,impressed by his brother, he
    became a follower of Fadaiyan Khalq Organization after the revolution. He
    was discouraged by the objectives and the programs of the Organization
    after a while. In the beginning of the Iran Iraq war, in 1980, Mr. Nezami
    went to the front to serve in the war.Towards the end of 1980, while he
    was still at the front, Mr. Nezami was summoned for an interview by the
    Ideological - Political office of the Military Academy. Followed by this,
    in the beginning of 1981, his name was placed on a list of expelled
    members, owing to his political affiliation. A while after he was expelled
    from the Military Academy; the Islamic Revolutionary Military Tribunal
    found him incompetent, due to his leftist beliefs; and he was eventually
    expelled from the army, too. According to information published by the
    courts, Mr. Nezami was drawn to the Tudeh Party by a friend, as soon as he
    was expelled from the army. Early in 1981, he joined members of the covert
    Tudeh network within the army. The Tudeh Party of Iran (Hezbe Tudeh or the
    Party of the Masses) was founded in 1941 by a group of mostly communist
    intellectuals. Its non-radical, reformist platform and its name reflected
    the founders hopes to attract the larger religious population. Instead,
    the Party's Marxist-Leninist orientation and its anti-Imperialist and
    anti-Fascist positions made it most influential among intellectuals and
    educated Iranians. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, The Tudeh, with its
    country-wide organization, including active women, youth, and labor
    groups, as well as a secret military network (Sazman-e Nezami-ye Hezb-e
    Tudeh Iran), played a major role in Iran s political scene.The Tudeh was
    banned following an attempted assassination against the Shah in 1949.
    Nonetheless, the Party continued its activities, as well as its
    publications, of which there would be many. Following the 19 August 1953
    coup, the Tudeh s military network was annihilated with many of its
    leaders arrested or forced into exile, mostly to the Soviet Union and
    Eastern Europe. Over the years, the Party s political influence
    diminished, due to various splits resulting from its pro-Soviet stand and
    policies in periods of political tension in Iran and from the
    radicalization of the left in the 1960s and 1970s.After the 1979
    Revolution, the Tudeh declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic
    s regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported and
    collaborated with the government. Though the Party never opposed the
    Islamic Republic, it became the target of its attacks in 1982, and the
    Party's leaders and many members, including those of the new secret
    military network, were arrested.The Tudeh lost scores of its members
    during the mass prison killings of 1988. Following several splits, the
    Party resumed its activities in the early 1990s in exile. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Nezami was arrested at his residence on Azarbaijan Street in
    Tehran at about 5:00 p.m. on 2 May 1983 and was taken to an unknown
    location by two revolutionary guards. Shortly after the arrest, the
    officers searched his house. There was no information on his whereabouts
    or his situation until 30 December, when his family could visit him for
    the first time. A year after his his arrest, when he had his trial and the
    sentence was issued, he was transferred to the Evin Prison. There is no
