    Ms. Zahra Falahati Haj Zare' is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN
    Human Rights Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and
    Particulars of Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    from July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report specifies
    that although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all probability" there were
    several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). However, members of the Tudeh Party,
    People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization as
    well as 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged victims." Ms.
    Zahra Falahati Haj Zare' is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of
    the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity.
    This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of political prisoners.
    Additional information was drawn from the Bidaran website and the PMIO
    website. She was born in Tehran. She was a sympathizer of the MKO. She was
    imprisoned during the early 1980s. After her release, she joined the MKO
    in the border area. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Ms. Zahra Falahati Haj
    Zare' was a MKO messenger and was arrested on the border between Iran and
    Iraq. The MKO website does not have the exact date of her arrest. Trial
    There is no information about this trial, just as there is no specific
    information about any such trials that condemned thousands of political
    prisoners to death in a few months period. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had
    been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving
    or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge has ever been publicly levelled
    against the defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988),
    and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the
    families of the victims refer to the accusations against the prisoners
    that may have led to their execution. These include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict from the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    reproduced in the memoirs of his designated successor Ayatollah Montazeri
    corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against the
    executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the PMIO's
    members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and who "wage war
    against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available about the defendant’s defence. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived under most difficult
    conditions. Our visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. Over seven years, we witnessed that
    they were denied access to anything that would have allowed them to
    establish contacts outside their prison walls." Under such conditions the
    families reject the claim of the authorities that these prisoners were
    able to engage with the political groups outside Iran. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the defendant’s execution. Ms.
    Zahra Falahati Haj Zare' was hanged during the mass killings of the
    political prisoners on July 27, 1988.
