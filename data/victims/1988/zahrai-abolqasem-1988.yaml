    Mr. Abolqasem Zahra i is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of
    the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose execution was
    reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against Humanity.
    This book documents the mass execution of political prisoners which took
    place in 1988-89. Additional information regarding this execution was
    found on both the Bidaran and the Mojahedin websites. Mr. Zahra i was born
    in Borazjan. He was a high school graduate and a sympathizer of the
    People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization. During the Islamic Revolution, he
    actively participated in fighting against the previous regime. In 1982,
    while serving in the military, he was arrested for distributing Mojahedin
    Organization s newsletters and press releases. He was released a year
    later. Arrest and detention There is no specific information on the
    defendant s arrest and detention. According to the Mojahedin website, Mr.
    Abolqasem Zahra i was arrested for second time in 1985. He was detained
    for three years before he was executed. Trial No information is available
    about his trial. Relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988-89
    refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of
    executions throughout Iran. In 1988 they wrote an open letter to then-
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, in which they argued that the official
    secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They
    also noted that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been
    already been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either
    serving or had completed serving at the time when they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was publicly leveled against the
    defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the victim s families
    refer to the accusations used by the authorities against the prisoners
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict from the Leader of
    the Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri,
    his designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and states that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available about the defendant s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners note that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrillas operating near the borders, the
    families refer to the isolation of their relatives during their detention:
    "Our children lived in most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to
    10 minutes behind a glass divider via telephone every two weeks. During
    the past seven years, we witnessed that they were denied access to
    anything that would have allowed them to establish contacts outside their
    prisons' walls." Under such conditions the families reject the authorities
    claim that these prisoners were able to engage with the political groups
    outside Iran. Judgment No detailed information is available about the
    defendant s execution. Mr. Abolqasem Zahra i was executed in November
    1988.
