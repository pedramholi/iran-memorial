    Ms. Mada en was 17 years old and was a brave, energetic, and extremely
    kind woman who lived a simple life. She was about 10 when his brother s
    execution, seven days after his arrest, inflicted a great shock on her

    Ms. Mada en was born on April 18, 1971 and had six brothers and two
    sisters, and was the family s eighth child. Her father was an employee of
    the Unified Bus Company and they lived a life of financial hardship.
    (Boroumand Center interview with Ms. Mada en s sister, April 2, 2021;
    Pezhvak-e Iran, Spring 2010). Ms. Mada en was a senior in high school.
    (Boroumand Center interview with Ms. Mada en s sister, October 11, 2021).
    Three of Ms. Mada en s brothers were executed in 1981, 1982, and 1985.
    Their execution, especially that of Mr. Loqman Mada en who did not believe
    in armed struggle and was executed less than a week after his arrest, had
    a great effect on her family. The psychological pressure resulting from
    her brothers execution and the imprisonment of her father and other
    brothers for several years, had made life very difficult for her. From
    1985 forward, she would regularly go to Behesht Zahra Cemetery to visit
    her brothers graves. (Boroumand Center interview with Ms. Mada en s
    sister, April 2, and June 3, 2009). She had told her family of her
    intention to avenge her brothers death, and had talked about leaving Iran
    and joining the MKO. (Boroumand Center interview with Ms. Mada en s
    sister, April 2, and June 3, 2009; Be Yad Aar Telegram Channel, July 3,
    2021; Pezhvak-e Iran, Spring 2010). (Boroumand Center interview with Ms.
    Mada en s sister, October 11, 2021). From 1988 on, Ms. Mada en spent most
    of her time at the home of the Nuri family, whose children were MKO
    supporters. She probably met this family at Behesht Zahra Cemetery. The
    family s eldest son, Mr. Ezzatollah Nuri, tried to join the MKO s Camp
    Ashraf in Iraq in the summer of 1988. After a while, he contacted his
    family and informed them that he had actually arrived there. Mr. Nuri s
    mother then established contact with a number of MKO supporters, members,
    and family members, and got them to trust her to send them to Iraq.
    According to available information, almost none of the families of the
    individuals who tried to get their children to Iraq in this fashion have
    any news of them. Ms. Mada en tried to get herself to Camp Ashraf in the
    same fashion. (Boroumand Center interview with Ms. Mada en s sister, April
    2, and June 3, 2009; Pezhvak-e Iran, Spring 2010). According to Ms. Mada
    en s sister, Ms. Nuri s family contacted MKO members at Camp Ashraf years
    later, and realized that Mr. Ezzatollah Nuri had never gotten to the Camp.
    It is not clear where he was when he contacted his family. (Boroumand
    Center interview with Ms. Mada en s sister, October 11, 2021). There is no
    information available regarding Mr. Nuri s fate. According to her sister,
    Ms. Mada en was brave, energetic, studious, extremely kind, sensitive, and
    lived a simple life. From approximately 1987, after becoming acquainted
    with the families of executed MKO members, she became interested in Islam
    and observed religious rites and tenets such as praying and wearing Hijab,
    in a very serious way. (Boroumand Center interview with Ms. Mada en s
    sister, June 3, 2009). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted
    the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, a
