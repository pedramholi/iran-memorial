    He was a Tudeh member and a three-year veteran of the Iran-Iraq war.
    People saw him as dignified and shy. Mr. Khalil Bina i Masuleh, son of
    Hassan, is one of the victims in the mass killings of political prisoners
    in 1988. Many of the executed prisoners were members or sympathizers of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. However, members or supporters of
    Marxist Leninist organizations, such as the People s Fadaiyan of Iran
    (Minority) or Peykar, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the
    Tudeh Party and Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not oppose the
    regime, were among the victims. Complementary information has been
    gathered from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports of human rights
    organizations, interviews with family members, and memoirs of witnesses by
    the Boroumand Foundation. Information about Mr. Bina i Masuleh is taken
    from an electronic form sent to Omid by a person familiar with this case,
    as well as from the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran ,
    published by Tudeh Party Publications. Mr. Bina i Masuleh was born in
    Masuleh (Gilan province) in 1947. He graduated from the Military College
    with the rank of Artillery Colonel. After the revolution, he joined the
    Tudeh Party and served three years on the front line of the Iran-Iraq war.
    The sender of the electronic form states: His father was a laborer and
    raised him with a lot of difficulties. He was dignified and shy. He used
    to say during the Iran-Iraq War, when Khoramshahr was besieged, that he
    wasn t able to take off his military boots for a year and a half. The
    Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Party ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported the policies of the former Soviet Union.
    The Party played a major role in Iran s political scene until it was
    banned for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the
    1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic
    Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively
    supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic
    Republic, it became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of
    the Party s leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Bina i Masuleh was arrested in his home on May 28, 1983. Trial Mr. Bina i
    Masuleh was first tried and condemned to four years imprisonment. Whether
    or not a second trial condemned him to death is unknown. According to the
    available information, Iranian authorities did not try the victims of the
    1988 mass execution in court, with defense lawyers present. Instead, the
    prisoners were questioned by a three-member special committee, composed of
    a religious judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the
    Tehran Prosecutor. The committee questioned the leftist prisoners about
    their beliefs and their faith in God and religion. The relatives of
    political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial
    process that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their
    open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr. Hassan Habibi, they argued
    that the official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They noted that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners
    had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either
    serving or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges According to the above-mentioned book, during
    the three-member special committee trial the defendant was asked if he was
    a Muslim. He replied that everyone s beliefs concerned only that
    individual. Then he was asked: You infidel, do you accept the leadership
    of Emam [Khomeini]? He replied in the negative. He was asked right then to
    leave his watch and ring and other belongings in a plastic bag. Evidence
    of guilt The report of this person s execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense In their open letter, families of
    the prisoners noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to
    defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that
    these prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed
    members of the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed forces of the
    Islamic Republic, states that such claims are false, considering the
    circumstances in prisons; for our children faced the most difficult
    conditions [in prison, with] visitation rights of once every 15 days, each
    visitation lasting ten minutes through a telephone from behind the glass
    window, and were deprived of any connection with the outside world. We
    faced such conditions for seven years, which proves the truth of our
    claim. Judgment No specific information is available about the death
    sentence. Mr. Khalil Bina i Masuleh was hanged at Evin prison during the
    mass killings of political prisoners in September 1988.
