    Information about Mr. Esma il Ma arefi was gathered from an electronic
    form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with this case.
    Mr. Esma il Ma arefi is also cited in the list by the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, Minority Branch, as an affiliate of the organization who was
    executed in Iran after the 1979 revolution (published on 26 September
    2009). He was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners in
    1988. The Boroumand Foundation has collected additional information
    regarding the 1988 massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri,
    reports from human rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and
    victims families, as well as from the Bidaran website. The majority of the
    executed prisoners were members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other
    victims included members or sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist
    organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq (Minority) and the Peykar
    Organization, which opposed the Islamic Republic, as well as the Tudeh
    Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority), which did not. Mr. Esma il Ma
    arefi, son of Abolfazl, was born in Tehran in 1961. He was the youngest in
    his family and continued his education until 9th grade. He was mostly
    unemployed until he began working at a print shop. According to the
    website of the Fadaiyan Khalq Minority, he had joined the Rah-e Kargar
    Organization just before his arrest. However, according to the website of
    the Rah-e Kargar Organization, he was a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization before its split. That s why he was forced to leave his
    military service and work in a print shop. His activities were
    distribution of the organization s publications and participation in
    meetings. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist-Leninist group
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin
    America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. In 1981, the organization, which had opted for open
    political and electoral activity after the revolution, split over the
    critique of the concept of urban guerilla warfare and the support of the
    Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority
    opposed the Islamic Republic and, though it did not abandon the theory of
    armed struggle, its activities were mainly limited to the political arena
    and the labor movement. Following the Mojahedin Khalq Organization s June
    21st declaration of armed struggle, the Fadaiyan announced the
    organization of combatant cells. However, based on available information,
    these cells did not become operational. Many of the groups members and
    supporters were arrested and executed in the early 1980 s. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Esma il Ma arefi was arrested by agents of the Intelligence
    Ministry at his workplace in a print shop on a day in 1984 at 1:00 p.m.
    For the first two years, he was detained for escaping military service at
    the Central Military Police prison. After one of his comrades was detained
    and confessed that Esma il and several others had organized a cell of
    sympathizers of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization in their garrison, Mr.
    Esma il Ma arefi was transferred to Evin Prison. According to the website
    of the Rah-e Kargar Organization, his prison condition was not bad, and he
    had regular visitations while in custody at the Central Military Police
    prison. However, after he was transferred to the Evin prison, there was no
    news of him for two years. He was detained in solitary confinement without
    any visitation. Then he was allowed to visit his mother and had only one
    public visitation. Trial Mr. Esma il Ma arefi was tried and condemned to
    death in a court. Specific details about the circumstances of the trials
    that led to his execution are unknown. According to the testimonies of
    leftist political prisoners who were tried in Gohardasht Prison during the
    executions of the summer of 1988, the trials took place in a room on the
    ground floor of the prison after a few weeks of isolation, during which
    prisoners were deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts,
    and outdoor time. Toward the end of August, a three-member delegation
    composed of Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor; Hojatoleslam Nayyeri,
    the religious judge; and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, the representative of
    the Ministry of Information; asked prisoners questions about whether they
    were Muslim or Marxist, whether they prayed, and if their parents were
    practicing Muslims. Based on the prisoners responses, the latter were
    sentenced to be hanged or flogged until they agreed to pray. The
    authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s purpose and
    the serious implications of their responses. According to survivors,
    during the summer of 1988, a large number of prisoners sympathizing with
    the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their
    beliefs. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of execut
