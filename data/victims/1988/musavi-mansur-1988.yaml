    The information about Mr. Mansur Musavi was taken from an interview with a
    family friend. He was a victim of the mass killings of political prisoners
    in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    by human rights organizations, interviews with victims’ families, and
    witnesses’ memoirs. Mr. Musavi, son of Mostafa, was born on December 22,
    1958 in Aligudarz (in Lorestan province). He was married and had a
    daughter. His wife spent several years in prison in the 1980s. His
    brother-in-law, Mr. Reza Qoreishi Langrudi was also executed in 1988. Mr.
    Musavi was a member of the Razmandegan organization. The Razmandegan
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded in the
    winter of 1979. Its activities were focused on the working class and
    factories. The founding tenets of Razmandegan included the rejection of
    armed struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the
    Iranian Tudeh Party. It viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist”
    state and believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist
    principles. Razmandegan was among the groups that became known as Khat-e
    Se (Third line). By early 1981, disagreements on the Party’s position on
    the Iran-Iraq war caused internal splits in Razmandegan. These splits,
    which coincided with the massive and brutal repression of dissidents by
    the Iranian government, caused the Organization to disband. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Musavi was arrested in Tehran in 1983. No further detail is
    available about his arrest and detention. Trial Specific details about the
    circumstances of the trials that led to the execution of Mr. Musavi and
    thousands of other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to
    existing information, there was no official trial with attorneys or
    prosecutors. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to
    Minister of Justice at the time, Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official
    secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They
    note that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and
    sentenced to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already
    completed when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly stated against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice in 1988, and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran in February 2003, the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities’ accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as “hypocrites” who
    do not believe in Islam and “wage war against God” and decrees that
    prisoners who still approve of the positions taken by this organization
    are also “waging war against God” and should be sentenced to death.
    Defendants, who did not belong to the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, may
    have been accused of being “anti-religion” for not having renounced his or
    her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Musavi’s defense. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting
    the accusation that these prisoners (from inside the prison) had
    collaborated with armed members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    clashes with armed forces of the Islamic Republic, states that such claims
    “are false considering the circumstances in prisons; for our children
    faced the most difficult conditions [in prison, wit
