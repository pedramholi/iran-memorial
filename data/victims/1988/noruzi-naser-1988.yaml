    Information about Mr. Naser Noruzi was gathered from an electronic form
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with this case. Mr.
    Naser Noruzi is also listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, whose executions were reported by the
    organization in a book titled Crime Against Humanity . He is also one of
    1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission Special
    Representative s Report published on January 26, 1989. The Boroumand
    Foundation has collected additional information regarding the 1988
    massacre from the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports from human
    rights organizations, interviews with the witnesses and victims families,
    as well as from the Bidaran website. * According to the electronic form,
    Mr. Naser Noruzi, son of Mohammadesma il, was born in Ahvaz in 1960. He
    was single and a pharmaceutics student in Tehran University. He was a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, selling its newspaper and
    publications. According to the website of Mojahedin, he was born in
    Tehran. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to a split within the Marxist-Leninist Section
    of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of
    the MKO were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were central to the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, whether by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic s
    leaders. ** Arrest and detention According to the electronic form, Mr.
    Naser Noruzi was arrested in Tehran and transferred to Evin Prison. No
    specific information is available on his arrest and detention. Trial
    According to the electronic form, Mr. Naser Noruzi was condemned to 12
    years imprisonment during his first trial. No information is available on
    his second trial. According to the testimonies of some of the political
    prisoners who were tried during the executions of the summer of 1988 in
    Gohardasht and Evin prisons, the trials took place in a room on the ground
    floor of the prison, after a few weeks of isolation during which prisoners
    were deprived of visitation, television and radio broadcasts, and outdoor
    time. In August and September, a three-member delegation composed of
    Hojatoleslam Eshraqi, the prosecutor, Hojatoleslam Nayyeri, the religious
    judge, and Hojatoleslam Purmohammadi, representative of the Ministry of
    Information asked prisoners questions about their views on the Mojahedin,
    whether they would renounce their beliefs, and if they were ready to
    cooperate against the Mojahedin. Based on what the answers were, the
    prisoners would have been charged with counter revolutionary,
    anti-religion and anti-Islam, or associated with military action or with
    various [opposition] groups based near the borders, and would be sentenced
    to death. The authorities never informed prisoners about the delegation s
    purpose and the serious implications of their responses. During the summer
    of 1988, according to survivors, a large number of prisoners sympathizing
    with the Mojahedin or Leftist groups were executed for not recanting their
    beliefs. Relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then-Minister of Justice,
    Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges According to the electronic form,
    the charge against Mr. Naser Noruzi was cooperation with a fighter and
    anti-Islamic regime group during his first trial. N
