    Mr. Fariborz Salehi is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and Particulars of
    Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran During
    July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report specifies that
    although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all probability" there were
    several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were members of the
    Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan
    Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization as well as 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims." Information about Mr.
    Fariborz Salehi is taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001
    by The Tudeh Party of Iran Publications. He was born in Aligudarz and
    completed his high school education in Aligudarz and Esfahan. In 1972, he
    was admitted to the Tehran Technical University. Two years later, he began
    his political activities in connection with the Fadayian Khalq
    Organization and in 1975, he went underground. In 1976, he rejected the
    guerrilla struggle strategy and after leaving the Fadayian Khalq
    Organization, he joined the Tudeh Party. After the Revolution, he became
    an advisor to the Central Committee of the Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran
    was created in 1941. The Tudeh's ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it
    supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major
    role in Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second time
    following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh
    Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Tudeh Party never opposed the Islamic Republic,
    it became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the
    Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    According to the above book, Mr. Salehi was arrested by the Revolutionary
    Guards in his home in the spring of 1981. He was taken to the Evin Prison.
    He was tortured severely and was kept in the solitary confinement for
    several months. He had some visits with his family including his wife, who
    was also a prisoner. Trial Mr. Salehi was tried in a court in the Evin
    Prison in 1984. But, there is no information about a ruling against him.
    There is no information about the trial. Also, there is no specific
    information about the circumstances of such trials that condemned this
    defendant and thousands of other political prisoners to death in a few
    months period. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988
    refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of
    executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then- Minister of
    Justice Dr. Habibi, they argued that the official secrecy surrounding
    these executions is proof of their illegality. They noted that an
    overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to
    prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving at the time they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No
    charge was publicly levelled against the defendant. In their letters to
    the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting
    Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the
    authorities' accusations against the prisoners – accusations that may have
    led to their execution. These accusations include being
    "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as well as being
    "associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to the
    PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam and "wage war
    against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of the positions
    taken by this organization are also "waging war against God" and should be
    sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. According to the
    book, one of the members of the Tudeh Party testified against him in his
    trial in 1984. Defence According to the above source, the defendant
    defended his political beliefs in his first court appearance in 1984.
    Against the assertion that prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces
    operating near the borders, the families submit the isolation of their
    relatives from the outside during their detention: "Our children lived in
    most difficult conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a
    glass divider through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed, over the
    past seven years, that they were denied access to anything that would have
    allowed them to establi
