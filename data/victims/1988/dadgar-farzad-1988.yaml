    Mr. Farzad Dadgar is one of 1,000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and Particulars of
    Persons Allegedly Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during
    July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report specifies that
    although 1,000 names are mentioned, "in all probability" there were
    several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were members of the
    Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan
    Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization as well as 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims." Additional information
    about Mr. Dadgar is taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001
    by The Tudeh Party of Iran Publications. He was born in Kerman. He
    graduated from Alborz high school and entered the Technical University of
    Tehran majoring in electrical engineering. In 1974, he joined the Fadayian
    Khalq Organization and went underground a year later. In 1977, along with
    some others, he left the organization and joined the Tudeh Party. The
    Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh's ideology was
    Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The
    Party played a major role in Iran's political scene until it was banned
    for the second time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979
    Revolution, the Tudeh Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic
    Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively
    supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic
    Republic, it became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of
    the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Mr.
    Dadgar was arrested on February 6, 1983. He was transferred to the Evin
    prison. According to the book, he was tortured during his 33-month
    imprisonment in solitary confinement. Trial Mr. Dadgar was tried and
    condemned to life imprisonment. There is no information about the trial.
    Also, there is no specific information about the circumstances of such
    trials that condemned this defendant and thousands of other political
    prisoners to death in a few months period. The relatives of political
    prisoners executed in 1988 refuted the legality of the judicial process
    that resulted in thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988
    open letter to then- Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argued that the
    official secrecy surrounding these executions is proof of their
    illegality. They noted that an overwhelming majority of these prisoners
    had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they were either
    serving or had already completed serving at the time they were retried and
    sentenced to death. Charges No charge was publicly levelled against the
    defendant. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the
    UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the
    victims refer to the authorities' accusations against the prisoners
    accusations that may have led to their execution. These accusations
    include being "counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam," as
    well as being "associated with military action or with various
    [opposition] groups based near the borders." An edict of the Leader of the
    Islamic Republic, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini
    refers to the PMOI's members as "hypocrites" who do not believe in Islam
    and "wage war against God" and decrees that prisoners who still approve of
    the positions taken by this organization are also "waging war against God"
    and should be sentenced to death. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence
    There is no information about the defendant's defence. In their open
    letter, the families of the prisoners noted that defendants were not given
    the opportunity to defend themselves in court. Against the assertion that
    prisoners were associated with guerrilla forces operating near the
    borders, the families submit the isolation of their relatives from the
    outside during their detention: "Our children lived in most difficult
    conditions. Visits were limited to 10 minutes behind a glass divider
    through a telephone every two weeks. We witnessed, over the past seven
    years, that they were denied access to anything that would have allowed
    them to establish contacts outside their prisons' walls." Under such
    conditions the families reject the claim of the authorities that these
    prisoners were able to engage with the political groups outside Iran. It
    is possible that the prisoners who were members of organizations other
    than the Mojahedin Khalq were charge for being "anti religious" and were
    condemned for insisting on their beliefs. Judgment No specific information
