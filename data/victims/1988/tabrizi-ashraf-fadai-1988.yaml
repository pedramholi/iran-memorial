    Information about Ms. Ashraf Fada’i Tabrizi has been drawn from an
    electronic form sent to Omid by a former cellmate. She is also among 3208
    members and sympathizers of the People’s Mojahedin of Iran Organization
    (PMIO) whose execution was reported by the organization in a book entitled
    Crime Against Humanity . This book documents the 1988-89 mass execution of
    political prisoners. Information about the mass executions has been
    gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah
    Montazeri, reports of human rights organizations, interviews with victims’
    families, and witnesses’ memoirs. Moreover, Ms. Fada’i Tabrizi is one of
    1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights Commission’s Special
    Representative’s Report, “Names and particulars of persons allegedly
    executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the period July-December
    1988,” published January 26, 1989. The report specifies that although 1000
    names are mentioned, “in all probability” there were several thousand
    victims. “Most of the alleged victims were members of the Mojahedin.
    However, members of the Tudeh Party, People’s Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe
    Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among
    the alleged victims.” Ms. Fada’i Tabrizi was a sympathizer of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. She was loved by other prisoners because she
    was kind to others (despite differences in their political opinions) and
    she defied the pressures of prison and interrogation. The prisoner guards
    and prisoners who had recanted their political views disliked her for the
    same reasons. She was intelligent and very beautiful. Arrest and detention
    Ms. Fada’i Tabrizi was arrested in Tehran in the summer of 1981. The
    details of her arrest are not known. She spend most of her life in prison
    in ward used to “punish” the prisoners. She spent near two years in
    solitary confinement in Gohardasht prison (1982-1984). She then was
    transferred to Qezelhesar prison (section 3). Ms. Fada’i Tabrizi was 17 at
    the time of arrest and a high school student. In the spring of 1985, she
    studied in prison and graduated from high school. Studying and taking
    exams of the Ministry of Education in prison were among the reforms that
    took place in 1985 and lasted only for a year. In 1986, Ms. Fada’i Tabrizi
    was sent to Evin and she was sent back to Gohardasht for a few months in
    1987. She was in section 3 of ward 1 of Gohardast, known as “sanatorium”,
    from the autumn of 1987 to 1988. As a section used for “punishment”, the
    conditions there were particularly difficult. The doors to the rooms were
    always locked and would be open only 3 times a day, each time for 30
    minutes. The prisoners could to use the bathroom, take showers, and wash
    their dishes and clothes only during these intervals until the doors were
    locked again. In the summer of 1988, she was taken to solitary confinement
    and never returned to the “sanatorium.” Trial Ms. Fada’i Tabrizi was first
    tried and condemned to 10 years imprisonment. She was denied the right to
    have an attorney or access to her file. At the time of execution, she had
    spent 7 years in prison. Specific details on the circumstances of the
    trials that led to the execution of Ms. Fada’i Tabrizi and thousands of
    other individuals in 1988 are not known. According to existing
    information, there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney
    and prosecutor. Those who were executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man
    committee consisting of a religious judge, a representative from the
    Intelligence Ministry, and a Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee
    asked the leftist prisoners some questions about their beliefs and whether
    or not they believed in God. The relatives of political prisoners executed
    in 1988 refute the legality of the judicial process that resulted in
    thousands of executions throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then
    Minister of Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy
    surrounding these executions is proof of their illegality. They note that
    an overwhelming majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced
    to prison terms, which they were either serving or had already completed
    serving when they were retried and sentenced to death. Charges No charge
    has been publicly leveled against the victims of the 1988 mass executions.
    In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special
    Rapporteur visiting Iran (February 2003), the families of the victims
    refer to the authorities accusations against the prisoners – accusations
    that may have led to their execution. These accusations include being
    “counter-revolutionary, anti-religion, and anti-Islam,” as well as being
    “associated with military action or with various [opposition] groups based
    near the borders.” An edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his
    designated successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the
    charges against the execut
