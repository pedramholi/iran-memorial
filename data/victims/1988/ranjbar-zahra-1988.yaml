    A sympathizer of the Mojahedin, Ms. Ranjbar had grown up in Shiraz, in
    Fars. She was still a student when, at 30, she was charged with ambiguous
    crimes. Ms. Zahra Ranjbar was a victim of the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO, also known as People s Mojahedin
    Organization of Iran - PMOI). Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fadaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fadaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. The Boroumand Foundation has gathered information about the
    mass executions from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports by human
    rights organizations, interviews with victims families, and witnesses
    memoirs. Ms. Zahra Ranjbar is listed among 3,208 members and sympathizers
    of the People's Mojahedin of Iran Organization (PMIO) whose executions
    were reported by the organization in a book entitled Crime Against
    Humanity. This book documents the 1988-1989 mass execution of political
    prisoners. Additional information was drawn from the Mojahedin Khalq
    website. According to this information, Ms. Zahra Ranjbar, 30, was born in
    Shiraz and was a student. Further information was sent via an electronic
    form by a prison mate of Ms. Zahra Ranjbar. The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. * Arrest and detention According
    to the electronic form report, Ms. Zahra Ranjbar had been detained in
    solitary confinement for a year. Her brother and fianc were executed.
    According to her cellmate, she had been pressured by interrogators to
    confess. She showed her tortured feet and legs. It was like they were both
    burned up to her knees, quotes her cellmate. A doctor visited her twice in
    order to find a way to heal her legs. But he couldn t help her. She just
    kept her feet and legs lubricated. Zahra told her cellmate that once she
    became unconscious during flogging. When she gained consciousness, she
    realized that she had been raped and had to change her underwear. Trial
    Specific details on the circumstances of the trials that led to the
    execution of Ms. Zahra Ranjbar and thousands of other individuals in 1988
    are not known. According to available information, the Iranian authorities
    did not try the victims of the 1988 mass execution in a court with the
    presence of a defense lawyer. The prisoners executed in 1988 had been
    questioned by a three-member special committee composed of a religious
    judge, a representative of the Intelligence Ministry, and the Tehran
    Prosecutor. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute
    the legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of
    executions throughoutIran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of
    Justice Dr. Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these
    executions is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming
    majority of these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms,
    which they were either serving or had already completed when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges According to the Mojahedin report,
    Ms. Zahra Ranjbar was collectively charged with, Counter revolutionary
    opinion and/or speech; War on God, God's Prophet and the deputy of the
    Twelfth Imam. In their letters to the Minister of Justice (1988), and to
    the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran (Febr
