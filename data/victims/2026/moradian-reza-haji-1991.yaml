    Shot with war ammunition in the lung area during protests. Originally from
    Shabad, lived in various areas including Shahryarshahr and Vali-e Asr Shabad
    before moving with family to Ni-pehan village in Qasr-e Shirin due to his
    father's agricultural lands. Was a tattoo artist who moved to Karaj with his
    wife for career advancement. Body was delivered to family after extensive
    pressure and difficulty - many victims' bodies were reportedly stacked on top
    of each other in a warehouse. Burial was forced to be conducted quietly at 10
    AM instead of the planned 2:30 PM ceremony due to security pressure. Buried
    under heavy security presence with IRGC forces, plainclothes agents, mobile
    phone and internet cuts, with only close relatives present. Family continues
    to face unspecified security pressures.
