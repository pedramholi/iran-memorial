  Born in 1367 and from Kermanshah. After about a week of absence, his body
  was found in Tehran. His family, after repeated visits and attending the
  forensic medicine office for body identification, learned of his death. He was
  someone who did not remain silent in the face of oppression. A video shows him
  preventing insults to customs workers and forcing a representative to leave
  with a harsh reaction. His behavior was a clear reflection of his
  justice-seeking spirit and his stance against power.
