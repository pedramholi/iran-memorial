    Shot directly by Islamic Republic suppressive forces in Fardis, Karaj. He
    was a production line worker at 'Toga' company. After his death, the company
    deleted all his information and records from their systems due to fear of
    security pressures. Security forces did not allow his family to bury his body
    in Karaj. The family was forced under pressure to transfer his body to
    northern Iran for burial in one of the villages in the Savadkuh region. This
    represents the regime's policy of creating terror, controlling burial
    ceremonies, and preventing public gatherings at victims' graves.
