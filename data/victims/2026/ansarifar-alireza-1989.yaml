    Teacher and official education employee with master's degree in psychology.
  Shot directly with military bullet to the head on Thursday January 8, 2026 (18
  Dey) in Marlik area. Bullet hit his brain causing severe injury. Was kept
  alive on life support for one full week in coma with very low consciousness at
  Shohada-ye Salamat Malard Hospital. IRGC forces prevented organ donation
  despite his organ donor card, stating those shot during protests cannot donate
  organs. Family was demanded approximately 2 billion tomans as 'bullet fee'
  after autopsy to determine weapon type. Died after one week without being
  allowed to donate organs despite being healthy and suitable for donation. Body
  was eventually returned to family and buried in Behesht-e Fatemeh cemetery in
  Qods city.
