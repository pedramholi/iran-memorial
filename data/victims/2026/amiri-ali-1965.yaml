  Shot with a bullet to the temple area. Left home alone around 6:30-7 PM on
  Friday evening before any protest calls, never returned. Family searched
  hospitals, detention centers and streets for days. Body was found bloodied and
  later washed for identification at Behesht Reza cemetery in Mashhad. After his
  killing, authorities pressured family to present him as a 'Basiji' member,
  which family refused. Death was ultimately registered as an 'accident' to
  cover up the crime. Described as a cheerful, harmless, and jovial person who
  had never even seen the inside of a detention center and was not one to cause
  trouble at his age.
