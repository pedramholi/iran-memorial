    Kurdish man, father of two children (18-year-old daughter and 25-year-old
  son). During Thursday protests in a crowd, when a woman was shot and security
  forces wanted to assault her, he intervened to save her. When authorities told
  him to leave so they could assault the woman, he refused saying he wouldn't
  leave until he saved her. Security forces immediately shot him directly. He
  was taken to hospital where he could potentially have been saved, but medical
  negligence led to his death.
