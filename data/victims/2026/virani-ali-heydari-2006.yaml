  20-year-old from Virani village in Shandiz district of Binalood county in
  Razavi Khorasan province. Was arrested on January 8, 2026 (18 Dey 1404) during
  the Shir-o-Khorshid Revolution in Mashhad while he had been previously injured
  in protests. His family was kept completely unaware of his detention location,
  physical condition and fate until dawn of February 9, 2026 (20 Bahman). A
  security official contacted the family and asked them to come collect their
  son's body, which was handed over without any official explanation about the
  cause of death. According to relatives, evidence shows Ali Heydari Virani died
  in detention and was in good health before arrest. Reports also suggest the
  possibility of secret execution without trial, constituting forced
  disappearance and killing in custody.
