    Shot in the side/torso area during protests on Piroozi Street in Tehran. He
    was the only child of his family and son of someone killed in the 8-year
    Iran-Iraq war. Both father and son gave their lives for their homeland. The
    night before on 19 Dey, he witnessed widespread crimes by suppression forces
    and personally took many injured people to the hospital, but despite seeing
    all those crimes, he was not afraid and stayed until his last drop of blood
    for Iran.
