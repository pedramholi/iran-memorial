    Shot and killed along with Hadi Ghanbarpour at a checkpoint 5 kilometers

    got back in to leave, they were shot from 5-10 meters away with dozens of war
    bullets. Aligholi was severely injured by dozens of bullets and pellets to his
    chest, head, neck, face and spinal cord. After being hospitalized for several
    days, he was abducted from the hospital at midnight by regime security forces
    accompanied by clerics. His body was returned to his family after he died. The
    regime attempted to present him as a 'martyr of the Islamic Republic' but this
    was rejected by the people of Jonghan.
