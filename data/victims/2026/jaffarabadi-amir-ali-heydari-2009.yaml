    Shot and killed on the evening of Thursday, January 8th, on Kashan Street in
    the Elahiyeh neighborhood. He was targeted with live ammunition loaded in an
    AK-47, fired directly by the Islamic Republic security forces, and died on the
    spot. After killing the teenager, the forces seized his body and later handed
    it over to the family in exchange for one billion tomans. The family was
    previously pressured to list the cause of death as 'fall from height' but
    refused, yet the death certificate was issued with that claim.
