    Kurdish citizen from Qasr-e Shirin and industrial management student at
    Shahroud University. Shot in the back by military-security forces of the
    Islamic Republic while in front of his family home during popular protests in
    Qods city (Qaleh Hassan Khan). His mother found his bloody body when she
    opened the door. Security forces initially transferred his body to hospital
    then to Kahrizak. Initially 700 million tomans was demanded for body delivery,
    but family refused to pay and body was eventually delivered. Security forces
    did not allow transfer of body to Qasr-e Shirin, forcing family to hold burial
    ceremony on 23 Dey under security force control with limited attendance of
    close relatives in Tehran.
