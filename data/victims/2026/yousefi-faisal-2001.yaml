    25-year-old from Qeshm city. On the first night of the protests, he
  courageously provided shelter to young people and prioritized others' lives
  over his own. On the second night, the regime's agents deceived him with cries
  of 'help help' and as soon as he opened the door, they shot him directly in
  front of his parents' eyes. Killed at home through deception and close-range
  shooting, part of the criminal pattern of the terrorist Islamic Republic
  regime during the Iranian national uprising.
