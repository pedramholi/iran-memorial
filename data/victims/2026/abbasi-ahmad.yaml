    Shot on Piroozi Street. After being shot, he made it to an alley and gave
    his phone to someone, asking them to call the last person on his contact list.
    He died before his family could reach Piroozi Street. Due to security
    conditions and lack of ambulances around Piroozi Street, Ahmad Abbasi's mother
    held her son's body in the alley from night until morning to prevent security
    forces from taking it. His body was eventually transferred to Kahrizak Legal
    Medicine facility where plainclothes forces kidnapped the body. Authorities
    are demanding one billion tomans as 'bullet fee' to return the body to the
    family.
