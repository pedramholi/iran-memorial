    Shot in the neck by government forces in the Fallah district of Tehran on
    Thursday evening. His family found his body among the killed in Kahrizak after
    three days of searching and buried him on January 12, 2026. Due to his
    family's difficult economic situation, he worked in a small workshop after
    receiving his high school diploma to help support the family. Government
    agents did not allow memorial services to be held in local mosques or public
    places, so only a small private ceremony was held.
