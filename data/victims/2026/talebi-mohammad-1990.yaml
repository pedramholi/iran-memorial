    Shot directly in the neck by government forces during events at Haft-Howz
  Square in Tehran. Body was delivered to family shortly after death because he
  was the brother of a martyr. Burial ceremony was held on January 11, 2026.
  After his death, individuals affiliated with the Shahid Foundation visited the
  family to record photos and videos to introduce him as a 'martyr for Islam', a
  narrative that does not align with his life and death and was not accepted by
  the family. He was a motorcycle enthusiast who loved heavy motorcycles and was
  a passionate young man who loved life.
