  Shot directly by government forces' bullets in Rasht city. Originally from
  Fouman county. Was a childhood friend of Mehran Basir Tavana who was killed in
  the 2022-2023 protests and never forgot his grief over losing Mehran. Was
  arrested for 15 days after chanting against government suppression and
  violence at Mehran's 40-day memorial ceremony. Was a football enthusiast and
  leader of Fouman football team, worked at a hookah lounge. Family was
  pressured after his death - body was buried at night in complete silence with
  only mother, sister and brother allowed to attend. Even hanging a black flag
  on their house door was prohibited. Family had to pay bail to receive his body
  and now remain silent due to fear of further pressure. Buried at Imamzadeh
  Mirza in Fouman near his family's residence.
