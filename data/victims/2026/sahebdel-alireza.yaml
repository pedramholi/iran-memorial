    Shot and killed by plainclothes forces on Aban Street in Lab-ab area of
    Rasht. He was fleeing from plainclothes forces who had taken control of
    checkpoints and were firing indiscriminately. He was separated from his
    companions during the escape and was ambushed by plainclothes forces on Aban
    Street near Haj Hossein restaurant. He was shot twice - once in the heart area
    from the front that exited the other side of his body, and once near the neck
    area that also exited the other side. The bullets were likely fired from a
    Kalashnikov rifle at very close range. After being killed, one of the
    plainclothes officers repeatedly kicked his body while saying 'Seyyed Ali
    sarnegoneh, are?' (referring to Supreme Leader). His body showed no reaction
    to the kicks. His body was then placed in the trunk of a car and taken away.
    His body was found a week later in Bagh-e Rezvan cemetery in Rasht along with
    his uncle-in-law's body.
