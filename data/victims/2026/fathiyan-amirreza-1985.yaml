    Shot directly in the heart by security forces' bullets. Mining engineer who
  had always dreamed of becoming a journalist and was passionate about telling
  the truth. Despite having a wealthy father who was a trader aligned with the
  Islamic Republic, chose to live a simple life in a small rented room. After
  his death, there were attempts to register him as a 'security martyr' but part
  of his family resisted and prevented this distortion of his story. He was a
  passionate fan of Naser Hejazi and like Hejazi never bowed down, stood by his
  principles and beliefs until the last moment.
