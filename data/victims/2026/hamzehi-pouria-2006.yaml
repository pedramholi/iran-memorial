    Shot by government sniper positioned on National Bank of Iran rooftop at

  shoulder. Was hospitalized at Sadoughi Hospital in Isfahan under IRGC
  supervision. Despite being alive with only a shoulder wound, family was not
  allowed to see him. After one week of family pursuing his whereabouts, they
  were told they could go to Bagh Rezvan (cemetery). When family reached his
  body, they found he had been killed with a coup de grâce shot. While his
  shoulder was bandaged, there were traces of another bullet on his chest.
  Killed in hospital while wounded - a crime against humanity.
