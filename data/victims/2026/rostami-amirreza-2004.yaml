    Shot by government forces with two bullets to the heart and shoulder area
    during protests in Yaft Abad, Tehran. He was reportedly throwing back tear gas
    canisters toward security forces when he was shot. He was unmarried and had
    only two months left of military service, and was on leave participating in
    protests with friends. His body was buried under security conditions in
    complete silence at Darolsalam Cemetery in Islamshahr, with family not allowed
    to take photos or videos. Security pressures also prevented holding
    traditional third and seventh day memorial ceremonies.
