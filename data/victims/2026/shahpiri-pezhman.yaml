    Shot with war bullets by security forces at Helal Ahmar intersection in Izeh
    city. The bullet hit his shoulder and he died hours later due to heavy
    bleeding. Security forces transferred his body to Ahvaz and forced his family
    to remain silent. Against the family's wishes, they imposed a martyrdom
    narrative and forced the family to bury him in the martyrs' section under
    strict security measures without holding tribal ceremonies. The family did not
    use the word 'martyr' in their obituary notice.
