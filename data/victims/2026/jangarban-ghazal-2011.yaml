  15-year-old high school student shot with 3 bullets to the back, leg and
  side by regime suppression forces in the dry riverbed of Zayandeh Rud in
  Isfahan. The killing occurred in front of her terrified father's eyes. Her
  grieving mother wrote that three fiery bullets came from nowhere and
  mercilessly hit her body, and she only said 'Dad...' before dying. She was an
  only child.
