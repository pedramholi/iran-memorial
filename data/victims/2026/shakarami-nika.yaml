  Killed by security forces during protests. Initially arrested by Team 12
  consisting of Arash Kolahr, Sadeq Manjazi, and Behrouz Sadeqi under
  supervision of Morteza Jalil near Laleh Park. After being transferred to a
  refrigerated van and then toward Evin prison, she resisted during transport.
  Officers gagged her with socks, sexually assaulted her, and when she fought
  back by kicking her attacker, they brutally beat her with batons and shock
  batons to the head until she died. Her body was then dumped on an empty street
  in Tehran on orders from Mohammad Zamani (Naim 16).
