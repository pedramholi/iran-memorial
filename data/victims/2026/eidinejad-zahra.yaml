    28-year-old dentist and married woman. Shot by suppression forces of the
    Islamic Republic regime from a rooftop in the Haft-Tir area during the Sun and
    Lion Revolution. She was learning a language for emigration purposes and had
    only come to the location to join the crowd. Her body was returned to the
    family after four days and security forces prevented the family from attending
    the burial ceremony, announcing that only a limited number were allowed to
    participate.
