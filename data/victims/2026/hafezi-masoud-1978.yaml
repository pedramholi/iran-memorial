    Died after his body was found following a six-day search. Authorities
    demanded 200 million [tomans/rials] from his father in exchange for returning
    his son's body and permission to bury him in the martyrs' section of the
    cemetery. His father, who has years of experience with the opposition front,
    refused with dignity, saying his son gave his life for the homeland and was
    not a mercenary killer.
