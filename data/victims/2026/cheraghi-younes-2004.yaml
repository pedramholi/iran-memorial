cause_of_death: "Gunshot"
circumstances: >
    Shot from behind with war bullets while moving away from the scene during
    protests in Fouladshahr. Security forces engaged in widespread and direct
    shooting. An unknown person who knew Younes transported his wounded body by
    car to near his family's home. The family, thinking he was alive, took him to
    Fouladshahr Hospital where blood was seen from his mouth and nose. The
    hospital doors were closed and families were denied information. Many other
    bodies were also brought to the hospital by families. After about 10 hours, no
    clear information was given to the family, and the next day bodies were
    transferred from the hospital by security agencies. The family went through a
    long, ambiguous process with pressure and threats to receive the body. After
    about 10 days, the family was told the body could only be buried with limited
    attendance and no public ceremony. Younes had been working since adolescence
    in jobs like construction and welding, and just one week before his death had
    started a new job as a CNC cutting machine operator at a company.
