    Shot directly in the head with live ammunition by government suppression
  forces on Kashani Street during popular protests. The 17-year-old had told his
  mother he wore two jackets so that if he was hit by bullets he would only be
  wounded, but government forces shot him in the head from behind. His father is
  a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who had to use his veteran card because
  authorities refused to return his son's body. The family remains under
  security surveillance.
