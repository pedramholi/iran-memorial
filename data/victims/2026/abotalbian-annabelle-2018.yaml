    8-year-old girl shot and killed while traveling with her mother in a car in
  Isfahan. They were trying to go home but security forces blocked their route.
  The mother circled around multiple times, explaining that their home was on
  that street, but they still wouldn't let her pass. When she took an
  alternative route, they ordered her to stop and then opened fire. The child
  was killed. Authorities threatened the family extensively and buried the child
  under the name of 'national martyrs' in their procession at Isfahan's Martyrs
  Cemetery. The mother's condition deteriorated severely and she attempted
  suicide by cutting her wrists, though she survived. The child's school and
  classmates were heavily threatened not to speak about the child or their
  friend. Days later, state TV went to the school and made the 8-year-old
  children cry while filming them, then forced them to sing Iranian national
  songs. Graffiti was written on city walls saying 'Anila, martyr of Iran, death
  to America.'
