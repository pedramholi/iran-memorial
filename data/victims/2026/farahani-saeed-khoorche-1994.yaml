    Shot in the head with live ammunition by government forces during popular
  protests. Killed by a sniper positioned on top of a building near the
  gathering location. He had made a will requesting that if killed by Islamic
  Republic forces, his death announcement should state he was a 'martyr for the
  homeland', but security forces prevented his family from honoring this request
  and called him a 'rioter' instead. Originally from Ashtian in Markazi
  Province.
