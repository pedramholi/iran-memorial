  Shot in the heart during protests in Fardis, Karaj. Originally from Lak,
  Kermanshah. Left home at 8 PM and never returned. Had told his daughters
  before leaving that he couldn't stay home on the anniversary of the Ukraine
  flight incident where so many elites were killed, saying that if he went out,
  one less young person would be killed. He told his children to always maintain
  a fighting spirit and not fear martyrdom.
