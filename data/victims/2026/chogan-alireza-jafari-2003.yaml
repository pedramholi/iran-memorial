    Turkmen citizen of Gonbad-e Kavus, shot directly by Islamic Republic of Iran
    government forces on Sarabi Street during protests in the city. His body was
    delivered to the family after several days at 6 AM. Before the body was
    delivered, the family was repeatedly threatened by security institutions to
    'not make trouble'. Two security agents accompanied and controlled the family
    inside the morgue. The body was transferred directly to the cemetery and the
    family only had a few seconds to see his body. The burial ceremony was
    conducted without public rituals and under security pressures at Gonbad-e
    Kavus cemetery.
