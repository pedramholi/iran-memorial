    Poet and writer shot with a war bullet by regime suppressors. Described as a
    cultured, moral person and noble child of the homeland. He was not only a
    father but also a cultural and human voice that was silenced by bullets,
    leaving his only daughter in eternal mourning. His killing represents the
    regime's fear of thought, words, and awareness.
