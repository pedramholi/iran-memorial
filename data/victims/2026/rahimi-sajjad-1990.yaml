    Shot with war bullets by Islamic Republic forces during anti-government
    protests in Marvdasht city, Fars province on the evening of 19 Dey. After
    being wounded, he did not go to the hospital in time due to fear of security
    forces and died from severe bleeding. He was a teacher. His father was an
    elder of the tribe and a well-known figure in Marvdasht. Security agencies
    agreed to hand over his body to the family on the condition that the burial
    ceremony would be with limited attendance and that the family would declare he
    was killed by 'terrorists' rather than government forces. The family agreed to
    the limited ceremony but refused to lie about their son's killers. Security
    forces prevented his mother from being present at the grave during burial,
    forcing her to watch from a distance.
