  Shot with a direct bullet by a sniper from the suppressive forces of the
  regime in Alvand city, Qazvin province. He was a resident of Alvand city,
  single, and worked as an apprentice in a rice shop. Only 20 days had passed
  since the end of his military service and he had a deep and passionate
  interest in boxing. His life, dreams and future were stopped with one criminal
  shot. The killing represents another example of the targeted massacre pattern
  of defenseless youth in Iran's national uprising.
