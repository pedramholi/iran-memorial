    3-year-old child killed by direct gunfire from war bullets by regime
    mercenaries during national uprising on 18 Dey month. She was not a protester,
    was not chanting slogans, had no weapon; she was simply alive and that was
    enough for the regime. After this crime, the regime's propaganda apparatus
    tried to cover up the truth with scenario-making and lies, and put pressure on
    the grieving family.
