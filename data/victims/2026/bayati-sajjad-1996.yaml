    Shot directly by security forces during protests in Gohardasht main street.

  forces prevented his companions from providing aid and rescue by shooting
  again. He was then transferred inside the police station and killed by
  gunfire. His body was only handed over to the family after they were forced to
  pay one billion tomans as 'bullet fee'. The family was under security pressure
  to remain silent and refrain from informing others.
