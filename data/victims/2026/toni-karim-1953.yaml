    Shot directly in the heart with a bullet while helping an injured person on
    Setareh Street in Parand. Was with his son who witnessed the killing. The
    governor contacted the family to come to their home and record a condolence
    message for Islamic Republic television, but the family refused entry and
    declared that this dear one's blood was spilled for the freedom of his people
    and they seek justice.
