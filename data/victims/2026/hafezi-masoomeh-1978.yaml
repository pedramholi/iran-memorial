    Shot directly with a war bullet to the liver area by government forces.
    48-year-old head of household, mother of two children and caregiver to elderly
    parents. After her killing, severe pressure was exerted on the family to
    declare her as a 'martyr' and accept the government's official narrative. Her
    body was transported to northern Iran for burial under intense security
    pressure with very limited attendees. The mosque door was not allowed to be
    opened for her ceremony, despite her previous extensive financial
    contributions to that mosque. Her body showed suspicious conditions - her
    abdomen was completely cut and stitched, but no signs of stitching or repair
    were visible at the bullet impact site, raising serious doubts about possible
    unauthorized organ removal.
