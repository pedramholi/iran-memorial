    Shot directly in the chest by regime forces. Family searched for him for
  days and nights in prisons, police stations, and detention centers hoping he
  might be alive, but finally found his lifeless body in the morgue registered
  with the horrific label 'unknown identity' (مجهول‌الهویه). This represents the
  regime's systematic method of killing, hiding, and anonymizing victims.
