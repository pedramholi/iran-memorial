    Shot in front of Basij base in Rudbar. Was the only son of his family, loved
  sports, and had opened a small mobile phone repair shop. His body was so tall
  that the coffin was too small and his legs stuck out. Authorities initially
  withheld his body and when they returned it, forced his family to claim it was
  the work of terrorists. Family was threatened that if they told the truth, his
  body would be stolen from the grave.
