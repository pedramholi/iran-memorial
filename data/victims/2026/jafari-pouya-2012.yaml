    14-year-old teenager shot directly by Islamic Republic suppressive forces to
  the head and eye area during nationwide protests. Family transferred his body
  to Khalili Hospital in Shiraz. Despite his death, hospital doctor had declared
  his eye needed to be removed, but hours later after contact from government
  forces, Pouya's body was suddenly transferred from the hospital. Four to five
  days later, Pouya Jafari's body was only handed over to the family after
  obtaining commitments and receiving money. According to informed sources,
  security agents buried the teenager's body themselves and warned the family
  they had no right to hold mourning ceremonies. Only his father and mother were
  allowed to visit the grave, and even at the burial site they were prohibited
  from crying and mourning. After burial, security forces stationed around the
  Jafari family's residence and with severe security measures tried to suppress
  any reaction, gathering, or information sharing about this teenager's killing.
