circumstances: >
    Shot with a war bullet in the waist from behind in District 19 of Tehran,
    Khaniabad, in front of Shekar Banu pastry shop. Despite the possibility of
    survival, agents prevented his rapid transfer to hospital, and this delay
    caused him to die from the severity of his injuries. His body was eventually
    handed over to his family after receiving a 'bullet fee' and was buried on
    Sunday in Behesht Zahra, section 225. Family and friends described him as a
    peaceful, kind person who loved animals and nature, who died innocently and in
    silence.
