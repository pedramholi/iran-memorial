    Two-time bodybuilding champion and coach shot and killed at a protest. Had
  posted on Instagram hours before his death: 'I just want my rights. A voice
  that has been silenced in me for over 40 years must scream. You took away our
  youth, hopes, dreams... I am here so that tomorrow I won't look at myself in
  the mirror and say that I had no vein, no honour ... I will pay anything for
  it.' Managed two charity organizations.
