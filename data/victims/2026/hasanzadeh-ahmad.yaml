    20-year-old from Ashkeran village in Varzaneh, Isfahan. His poor parents
    were threatened that they would not give back his body and would charge for
    the bullet if they didn't say Ahmad was a Basiji member. Authorities even
    produced a 'Basiji martyr' obituary for him, when he was actually a mechanic's
    apprentice earning an honest living.
