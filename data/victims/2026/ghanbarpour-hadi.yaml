    Shot and killed along with Aligholi Mokhtari at a checkpoint 5 kilometers
  from Jonghan city. Their car was inspected at the checkpoint, and when they
  got back in to leave, they were shot from 5-10 meters away with dozens of war
  bullets by IRGC suppression and intelligence forces. The regime attempted to
  present him as a 'martyr of the Islamic Republic' but this was rejected by the
  people of Jonghan. Both bodies were buried under strict security measures with
  families forced to give commitments not to publicize the matter.
