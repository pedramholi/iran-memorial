    Shot in the heart with a bullet. He was from Arak but living in Tehran, an
  only child and caretaker for his mother, working as a hairdresser. After his
  death, security agencies pressured his family to declare he was a 'Basiji'
  member, but his mother refused to accept this forced narrative despite
  threats, unwilling to let her son's true identity be distorted.
