    Trans man who was shot directly in the heart with a bullet. He was 24 years
  old, worked in accounting with a diploma degree, and was employed at a large
  manufacturing company in Baghestan area of Karaj. He also worked as a Snap
  driver after his main job to cover his expenses. Member of the queer community
  who, despite being assigned female at birth, did not consider himself a girl.
  The neighborhood where he lived did not have the capacity to accept his
  identity, but his family ultimately accepted his gender identity, as evidenced
  by the non-feminine photo they placed on his grave.
