    16-year-old blogger in the gaming field from Fardis, Karaj, shot directly in
    the heart area by a war bullet from suppressive forces of the terrorist
    Islamic Republic regime during Iran's national uprising. The severity of the
    injury was such that he was never transferred to hospital and died before any
    medical attention. His body was delivered to the family without going through
    any treatment process and his burial ceremony was held at Sakineh Paradise in
    Karaj.
