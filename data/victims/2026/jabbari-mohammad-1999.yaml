cause_of_death: "Gunshot"
circumstances: >
    Azerbaijani compatriot from Karaj who stood alone and defenseless against
  security forces to protect others' lives. He did not flee or retreat; he used
  his body as a shield for others' lives. The regime's response was shooting
  from close range - a bullet from about one meter away that took his life. This
  murder was the result of one person's courage and a government's terror.
