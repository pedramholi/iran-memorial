    Died during uprising in Lahijan. Worked in real estate transactions. Quote
    from relatives indicates he was happy saying 'I will die but my family will
    buy cheap chicken' and when asked why he didn't wear a mask, he said 'what
    difference does it make, mask or no mask, in the end it's death'. His eyes are
    always remembered in front of Mohebbi confectionery during the uprising.
