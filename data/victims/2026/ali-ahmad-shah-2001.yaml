    Shot with direct gunfire to the spleen and thigh area during the national
    uprising on Daneshju Boulevard in Gonbad Kavus. His father Hussein Shah-Ali, a
    veteran theater actor, was forced under pressure to sign documents confirming
    his son's killing by terrorists to receive the body. The burial was conducted
    with security forces present and they were not even allowed to print a
    condolence announcement. Ahmad's cafe was sealed. He was professionally
    involved in bodybuilding and in his last message wrote: 'It's passing from us,
    God willing the next generation won't see the Islamic Republic anymore.'
