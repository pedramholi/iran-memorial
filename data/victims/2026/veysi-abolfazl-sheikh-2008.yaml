    Shot by military and security forces during suppression of nationwide
  protests in Torogh neighborhood of Mashhad. Bullet hit his thigh area. Along
  with at least 21 other citizens, he was targeted by direct shooting. After
  being shot, security forces transported the wounded in vehicles including a
  Pride car to locations away from public view and abandoned them without
  medical care to die from blood loss. Security forces refused to hand over his
  body to family and pressured them to declare cause of death as 'stabbing'.
  Father was directly threatened that if he didn't cooperate and accept the
  security narrative, a case would be fabricated against his daughter as an
  'agitator'. Body was eventually handed over with condition of quiet burial in
  a remote village, but family transferred it to Torogh neighborhood in Mashhad
  for burial on 22 Dey 1404. Originally from Zabol, born in Zahedan, son of
  Shahab, Baloch ethnicity from Sistan and Baluchestan province.
