    Shot directly in the heart from behind while trying to save a wounded
    17-year-old teenager. He was unarmed and non-aggressive, only moving forward
    to save a child's life. He fell face-down on the ground and died in the arms
    of one of his companions. Witnesses describe his body growing cold moment by
    moment and his eyes that never closed again. He was the first casualty from
    Narjeh city during the national uprising.
