    Killed by the Islamic Republic regime. Was a barista and bartender, a young
    man who built his life with his own hands. His last story was a cry of honor:
    'History is made by those who did not fear and did not surrender.' He did not
    fear and did not surrender; it was the terrorist regime of the Islamic
    Republic that fears the youth. Became a martyr for the homeland.
