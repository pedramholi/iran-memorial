    Shot with a bullet to his back by Islamic Republic forces. He was 37 years
  old, had recently gotten his life together, renovated his house, and was
  planning to marry his partner. He was supportive of those around him and had
  helped many people in his neighborhood. On Thursday 18 Dey, he called his
  mother saying he wanted to go out that night. Despite his mother's insistence
  that he not go, he said 'Mother, if I don't go, who will? Look at our living
  situation, you take care of yourselves, I'll watch out for myself.' He went
  out and never returned.
