    Shot and killed by Islamic Republic security forces during popular uprising.
  Was trapped in an alley with other protesters, surrounded from both sides by
  government forces who opened fire. A bullet struck his heart and lungs, and he
  lay on the ground for about half an hour before losing his life. Was an
  18-year-old student set to begin studies in mechanical engineering, from a
  financially well-off family. His presence at protests was driven by awareness
  and solidarity rather than economic pressure. Two of his uncles were killed in
  the Iran-Iraq war, one was a well-known commander. The Golgoon family is among
  well-known families of the city, and a boulevard in Shahsavar is named
  'Golgoon Martyrs'.
