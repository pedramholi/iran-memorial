    Shot directly in the head with a war bullet on Ferdows East Boulevard
  between Ali Hosseini and Erik streets. He was a 26-year-old resident of
  Thailand, born in Jannat Abad neighborhood of Tehran. He had only been in Iran
  for two days from Thailand to visit friends and family. As a supporter of
  Prince Reza Pahlavi, he participated in the protests in response to calls made
  for building a better future and life for the people. His family found his
  body after three days of searching, and authorities demanded 2 billion tomans
  (compared to the usual 700 million tomans) for the release of his body due to
  his family's good financial situation.
