    Shot with pellets by suppressive forces during protests on 18 Dey 1404
  (January 8, 2026) in Isfahan while defending his wife Shirin. After being
  knocked down, several armed forces aimed their weapons at him and fired
  pellets consecutively, leaving over 200 pellets in his body and causing him to
  lose feeling in his legs immediately. He was left for dead by the attacking
  forces but survived initially. Despite being transferred to hospital and
  undergoing surgery with initial relative improvement, he eventually died on 11
  Bahman 1404 due to the severity of injuries and complications from the
  numerous pellets. He had been transferred home from hospital before completing
  full treatment due to fear of being finished off or arrested. Radiological
  images showed many pellets had hit sensitive areas of his body. Married man.
