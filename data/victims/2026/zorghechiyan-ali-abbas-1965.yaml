    Doctor who left his home on Thursday January 8th, 2026 around 6:45 PM to
    participate in nationwide protests in Sari. After six days of enforced
    disappearance during which his family searched hospitals, police stations,
    detention centers and morgues receiving contradictory and misleading responses
    from authorities, his body was identified at the medical examiner's office.
    Examination showed he had been shot in the side area. It remains unclear
    whether he was shot and killed immediately on the street during protests, or
    whether he was wounded and then died from blood loss while in custody of
    security forces without medical attention, or whether the shooting occurred
    during detention.
