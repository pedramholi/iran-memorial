    38-year-old Gilaki citizen from Lafmajan village in Lahijan county, killed
    by Iranian regime forces during protests in the Seygalan Square area of Rasht.
    Family was under severe security pressure after his death and the body
    delivery process involved coercion, requiring written guarantees from the
    family. Body was delivered alongside several other victims. Eyewitnesses
    reported severe, multiple and unusual injuries on his body that were so
    extensive that determining the exact location of the fatal injury was not
    clearly possible. No official or transparent explanation has been provided by
    responsible institutions about how he was injured and died.
