    18-year-old tattoo artist shot in the chest with a war bullet during evening
    protests in Ghaemieh, Eslamshahr. His father came to the streets after his
    son's death and joined the people, later discovering his son's body when
    someone asked for help lifting it. The regime's systematic killing of
    defenseless people, not an accident.
