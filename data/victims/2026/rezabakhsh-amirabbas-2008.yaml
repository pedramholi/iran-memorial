    18-year-old tattoo artist shot in the chest with a war bullet during evening protests in Ghaemieh, Eslamshahr. His father came to the streets after his son's death and joined the people, later discovering his son's body when someone asked for help lifting it. The regime's systematic killing of defenseless people, not an accident.
    Shot in the heart. Someone came to his father saying a young man was shot and needed help getting to the hospital. When the father arrived, he discovered it was his own son.
