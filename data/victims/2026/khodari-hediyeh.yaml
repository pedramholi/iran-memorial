province: "Markazi"
cause_of_death: "Beating"
circumstances: >
    17-year-old resident of Saveh who lived with her mother and two sisters.
    Kidnapped by security forces during Dey month protests. Family was kept in
    complete uncertainty for 6 days until the regime falsely claimed to her father
    in Ganaveh that 'your daughter had a heart attack', while her body was
    delivered with clear signs of torture and beatings. Family was forced to sign
    a silence agreement and threatened to have a quiet burial. During the funeral
    procession in Ganaveh, her mother held her daughter's wedding dress in her
    arms; women were wailing and the mother was spinning around with the wedding
    dress - a burning image of dreams extinguished by torture. She was killed
    under torture, not from a 'heart attack'.
