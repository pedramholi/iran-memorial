    Father of two children (16-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter), owned a
  shop in Arak. Shot directly with a war bullet by Islamic Republic forces in
  front of Vali-e Asr Hospital in Arak around 8:15 PM on Friday. The bullet hit
  his abdomen area and caused his death. Evidence of the bullet impact was
  clearly visible on his jacket - holes and burns from the war bullet remained
  on his clothes, indicating direct shooting from close range or with high
  power. After his killing, his family was pressured and threatened to confirm
  the government's official narrative about his death, with threats that his
  children would be deprived of continuing their education if they opposed or
  told the real story. Despite being from Arak, his body was not allowed to be
  buried in the city's cemetery. His burial ceremony was held three days later
  on Tuesday in Qaniaro village near Arak under special conditions and
  restrictions.
