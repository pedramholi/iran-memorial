    Shot directly in the head with a bullet on Setareh Khan street in Tehran
  during protests. He was a 35-year-old protesting citizen, originally from Qom,
  who owned a food preparation shop called 'Javanan' on Shadman street in
  Tehran. His father was also an old restaurateur in the same neighborhood and
  owned the 'Javanan Eslami' restaurant. Ehsan was unmarried and had been
  showing solidarity and opposition to the current situation through social
  media posts since the beginning of the popular protests. On the last day when
  internet was limitedly connected, he messaged a friend saying he was going to
  the street to participate in protests but never returned. A close friend
  identified his face in a video showing bodies of victims in the street, which
  was captured from the mobile phone of suppressive forces and shows a
  disturbing scene where after the massacre, suppressors are standing over the
  blood-soaked bodies of freedom-seeking people, laughing and celebrating.
