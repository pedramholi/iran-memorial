  Karaj and died from facial injuries. Two of his friends tried to transport his
  body by car but Islamic Republic forces prevented them and transferred the
  body to the coroner's office. His family faced pressure and threats when
  trying to retrieve the body. They were told they could only bury him if his
  name was registered as a 'Basiji' or if they paid 1 billion tomans. The family
  refused these conditions and after four days, through persistence and
  contacts, they retrieved the body. The family was warned they had no right to
  hold mourning ceremonies and were denied permission to bury him in their
  preferred location. According to authorities' orders, Hamed Basiri could only
  be buried in Eshtehard, Karaj.
