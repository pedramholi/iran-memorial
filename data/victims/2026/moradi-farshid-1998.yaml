    Shot by Islamic Republic snipers during popular protests in Fouladshahr on
  18 Dey. Bullet hit his head from above the rooftop and he died on the spot. He
  was a 28-year-old welder, son of Ali Mardan, Bakhtiari ethnicity, who worked
  mostly in Asaluyeh to make a living. After his killing, authorities withheld
  his body for several days and demanded 800 million tomans for its release.
  When the family couldn't pay, they were forced to claim Farshid was a 'Basiji'
  to get his body back. His body was finally buried on 29 Dey in Fouladshahr.
