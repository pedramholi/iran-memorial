    Shot in the chest with a Kalashnikov rifle during suppression of protests in
    Charmahin city. Protesters had gathered in the city square, burned the Islamic
    Republic flag, and moved toward the Basij base. When they approached the
    entrance, suppressive forces stationed inside opened fire directly at the
    crowd with Kalashnikov weapons. Four known suppressors fired: Rahim Hedayati,
    Alamdar Jafari, Shirzad Mehdipour, and Sirus Pirkhili. Colonel Alamdar Jafari
    of the IRGC was identified as the one who fired the fatal shot. Mehdi had
    completed his military service just two months before this incident.
