circumstances: >
    Mother of a 7-year-old daughter, shot by suppression forces during protests
  in Nurabad Mamasani. After being hit by a bullet, she called her husband and
  brother saying 'come take me', but minutes later was targeted by more gunfire.
  IRGC-affiliated forces transported the wounded and killed together, and Parisa
  was among those transferred. Her body was returned to the family after several
  days under security conditions, including restrictions on who could perform
  the ritual washing, burial in early morning hours, and prohibition on chanting
  by relatives. Multiple bullets were found in her body, including a shot to the
  heart that evidence suggests occurred after her phone call.
