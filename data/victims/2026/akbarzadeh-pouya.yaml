    Shot with two war bullets to his leg and heart on 18th Dey in Dowlat Abad
  (Tehran). Family was forced under threat to say he was a Basij member.
  Authorities took photos and videos from the family, then later removed banners
  and said 'Do you believe he was a Basij?! He is one of the rioters and you
  have no right to mourn!' Bodies were piled on top of each other in one room at
  Dowlat Abad clinic to hide the number of killed. Father and brother searched
  for 12 hours at Kahrizak. Bodies were scattered like watermelons, naked boys
  and girls, had to be placed one by one to see those underneath due to the
  large number of deaths.
