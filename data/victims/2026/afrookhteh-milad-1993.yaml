    Gilak citizen from Sangar, athlete, footballer and goalkeeper trainer. Shot
    on Motahari Street in Rasht during nationwide protests by forces of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran. After being shot, people and friends moved his body
    about 200-300 meters to Hajiabad Street area and placed him inside his
    personal car. To avoid sensitivity from security forces, those present
    contacted Milad's brother saying he was injured and had a headache, asking him
    to come take Milad home. The brother came with his wife and young child,
    unaware of the severity of the injury, but upon opening the car door found it
    soaked in blood.
