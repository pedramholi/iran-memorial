    Killed on 18 Dey in Kuhdasht, Lorestan. Posted a video on his page the same
  evening speaking in Luri language, saying they were going to the streets for
  Mahsa and Nika and the people of Iran, hoping Iran would be free by 10 PM that
  night if they stayed alive. Ended the video with epic Luri poetry.
