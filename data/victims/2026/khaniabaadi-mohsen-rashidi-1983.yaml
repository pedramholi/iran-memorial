circumstances: >
    Christian citizen shot by security forces with a military bullet while
  attempting to help his wounded friend Shahram Maghsoudlou during a protest in
  Baharestan Isfahan. After being shot in the thigh and bleeding severely,
  security forces stationed at the hospital prevented him and his companions
  from entering the emergency room and accessing medical services, causing him
  to die from severe blood loss. His family searched for him for five
  consecutive days without knowing his fate. Authorities offered to return his
  body only if the family signed a form falsely claiming he was a Basij member
  killed by protesters, which the family refused. His body was eventually
  returned after payment of one billion tomans. He had a 4-year-old daughter and
  two teenage stepdaughters.
