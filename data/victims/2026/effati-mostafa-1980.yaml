    imposed official narrative due to security pressure and family circumstances
    including advanced age of parents and proximity of relatives to government
    institutions. Family was told they would have to pay 'cost of the bullet' if
    they refused official claim, and body would be buried in undisclosed location
    otherwise. During burial ceremony, his mother openly stated her son had been
    killed by the Islamic Republic. Family emphasized he had no affiliation with
    government institutions or Basij, and his social media reflected critical
    stance toward authorities.
