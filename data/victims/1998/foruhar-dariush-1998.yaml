    In his youth, Mr. Foruhar organized young activists in support of
    nationalizing the oil industry. Decades forward, his critique of the state
    s concentration of power, continued to attract young Iranians. Mr. Dariush
    Foruhar, founder and leader of the banned Iran Nation Party, and his wife,
    Parvaneh, are two of the victims named in the 2000 Report of United
    Nations Special Representative. The report included their assassination in
    the string of disappearances and suspicious deaths in the second half of
    1998 of intellectuals and dissident political figures. * Popular reaction,
    the Special Representative noted, was strong and immediate and became more
    so as it became clear that the killings were part of what became known as
    serial killings,** committed by officials in or close to the Ministry of
    Information (Security). The information regarding this case has been drawn
    from several sources (see endnote). Mr. Dariush Foruhar was born on
    December 28, 1928 in Esfahan. He became interested in politics in high
    school. He enrolled in the Tehran University Law School in 1948 and joined
    the Pan Iranist Party. Mr. Foruhar married Ms. Parvaneh Eskandari on April
    23, 1961. They had two children. Mr. Foruhar was one of the founders of
    the Iran Nation Party in 1951. He was arrested and imprisoned for the
    first time in 1950, subsequent to his speech as the representative of
    students of Tehran University, in favor of nationalization of the oil
    industry. He was wounded in clashes with the forces that carried out the
    coup d tat and overthrew the nationalist government in August 1953. Mr.
    Foruhar was exiled to Qeshm Island. His activism led to several arrests
    and he spent a total of 14 years in prison under the previous regime (Ms.
    Foruhar s blog). In 1977, he co-signed along with Dr. Bakhtiar and Dr.
    Sanjabi a letter of grievances addressed to the Shah, (Ms. Foruhar s
    blog). After the Revolution of 1979, Mr. Foruhar was appointed the
    Minister of Labor in the interim government. [T]he creation of the [Labor]
    Loans Fund, Unemployment Benefits, and the increase of minimum wage were
    some of his achievements during his short period in the office (Parastu
    Foruhar s blog). Mr. Foruhar resigned later that year and was arrested in
    1982. His family was unaware of his whereabouts for many months. Mr.
    Foruhar is quoted saying that the few months he spent in Evin Prison were
    much harsher than his 14 years of overall imprisonment during the previous
    regime (his daughter s interview in Iran Emrooz ). Mr. and Ms. Foruhar
    were proponents of a democratic and independent Iran. They supported the
    separation of state and religion. They believed, and publicly stated, that
    the current structure of the state institutions in the Islamic Republic
    led to the concentration of power, and made reforms, particularly
    constitutional reforms, very difficult. With the relative opening of
    public space in the late 1990s, their persistent effort to promote their
    ideas attracted student groups who promoted democracy. The couple s
    funeral was attended by thousands of Iranian men and women who gathered
    spontaneously in spite of the overwhelming presence of security services.
    The Iran Nation Party was founded in 1951 as the result of a split from
    the Pan Iranist Party. The nationalist Iran Nation Party endorsed Dr.
    Mohammad Mossadeq s policies and actively resisted the coup of August 18,
    1953, which overthrew the Mossadeq government. The Iran Nation Party
    excluded Pan Iranism from its ideology in 1961. The Iran Nation Party
    joined the National Front, which was led by Dr. Shapur Bakhtiar, Dariush
    Foruhar, and Dr. Karim Sanjabi. The Party remained a member of this
    coalition until the Revolution. In 1979, the Iran Nation Party joined the
    Islamic Revolution forces and accepted the leadership of Ayatollah
    Khomeini. In June 1981, when the Iranian government intensified its
    oppression of political opposition and banned political parties, the Iran
    Nation Party limited its activities. The relative political opening that
    followed the presidential election of May 23, 1996, encouraged the Iran
    Nation Party to resume its activities unofficially, in particular among
    students. Murders On November 22, 1998, the bodies of Mr. and Ms. Foruhar
    were found in their house in Tehran. They both had been brutally murdered
    and stabbed multiple times. Persons who saw Mr. Foruhar s body later told
    his daughter that her father s arm was broken though the official forensic
    report only mentioned the knife wounds. To this date, the exact
    circumstances of the Foruhars death remain unknown to their family.
    Following the murders, the couple s daughter, Parastu, was called in to
    identify the bodies. None of the family s friends were allowed to
    accompany her. She was taken to an ambulance, where her parents bodies
    were laid. The authorities hastened the process, transferring the bodies
    immediately after she signed the necessary documents, and rejecting her
    request to stay a moment by her parents. The For
