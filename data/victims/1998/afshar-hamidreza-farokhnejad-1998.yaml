    was interested in sports since his childhood and took up Kyokushin when he
    was 12 years old and competed at the champion level at provincial
    tournaments. News and information about the death in detention of Mr.
    Hamid Reza Farokhnejad Afshar, son of Turan and Atta ollah, was obtained
    from Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interview with one of his relatives on
    July 2, 2018 (ABC interview). Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar was born on October
    23, 1975 in Bam County, Kerman Provence. Before the Islamic Revolution in
    1979, his father was a Gendarmerie officer, and after the war between Iran
    and Iraq began, he joined the army and fought on the Kurdish and Ahvaz
    fronts for three years. In 1983-84 Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar s father was
    arrested for drug trafficking and a year later he was executed by firing
    squad in Kerman. Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar stopped his education when he was
    in middle school and started working as a farmer. Since his childhood, he
    was interested in sports. He took up Kyokushin, a type of Japanese martial
    art, when he was 12 years old and competed at the champion level at
    provincial tournaments. According to the interviewee, Mr. Farokhnejad
    Afshar was a kind person who put others first and had a great passion for
    his family. Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar was 23 years old when he died. He was
    planning to get married to his fianc . Arrest and detention In early May
    1998, agents of the Khalili Komiteh in Shiraz (Center for Combating
    Narcotics and Social Corruption) arrested Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar at the
    home of one of his relatives in Shiraz. The night before the arrest, Mr.
    Farokhnejad Afshar and his brother went to Shiraz to buy a combine
    harvester and spent the night at the home of one of their relatives.
    According to the interviewee, the house was under surveillance by agents
    of the Shiraz Counter Narcotics Center (Khalili Komiteh), because there
    was probable cause that drugs had been stored in the house. The next
    morning, at 6 AM, armed plainclothes agents raided the house and woke up
    all the residents, including Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar and his brother, beat
    them, handcuffed and blindfolded them, and transferred all to the Khalili
    Komiteh. According to available information, during the approximately
    20-day period during which Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar was detained at the
    Khalili Komiteh, he was severely tortured. He was kept in very small,
    grave-like solitary confinement cells, punched and kicked, beaten with
    cable, pipe, and an electric shocker, and hung from the ceiling (Qapan*).
    Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar was deprived of his right to contact his family as
    well as the right to access an attorney while he was detained in the
    Khalili Komiteh in Shiraz. About 20 days after the arrest, Mr. Farokhnejad
    Afshar was sent to court along with other detainees. After the court
    session, they were all transferred to Adelabad Prison in Shiraz. Mr.
    Farokhnejad Afshar s Death According to available information, Mr.
    Farokhnejad Afshar suffered severe stomach pains after being transferred
    to Adelabad Prison in Shiraz. Doctors in the prison s clinic diagnosed
    inflammation of the appendix and transferred Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar to
    Shiraz Hospital for appendectomy surgery. At the hospital, his appendix
    was deemed healthy and the severe pain was attributed to an infection. The
    doctor prescribed a medicine and Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar was transferred to
    Adelabad Prison. The following night, Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar felt pain and
    was transferred to the prison s clinic. Despite the lack of specialized
    staff and medical facilities in the prison s clinic, Mr. Farokhnejad
    Afshar was refused transfer to the hospital. A few days later, following
    his brother s insistence and begging, the prison authorities acquiesced
    and transferred Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar to the hospital. According to
    eyewitnesses, Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar got into the ambulance on his own
    feet and was transferred to the hospital while handcuffed. The next
    morning, Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar died at Vali-e Asr Hospital in Shiraz. The
    doctors told his family that the torture caused an infection in Mr.
    Farokhnejad Afshar s kidney which spread to his blood and caused his
    death. The doctors explained that the injuries caused by torture were so
    severe that they could have caused death within just days, but that Mr.
    Farokhnejad Afshar s physical strength allowed him to endure for about 15
    days. Officials Reaction According to available information, following Mr.
    Farokhnejad Afshar s death, the judge threatened his mother that if she
    filed a complaint the life of her other child, also in prison, would be in
    danger. As a result, Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar s family never filed a
    complaint with judicial authorities. Trial Branch 2 of the Revolutionary
    Court in Shiraz tried Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar and other detainees in the
    case in one session. No information is available on Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar
    s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Farokhnejad Afshar is not
    known. The validity of the criminal charg
