    was studious and very kind; he used to say I can t eat my bananas if I don
    t share them with my friends Mr. Karun Hajizadeh (Pur Hajizadeh), a
    primary school student in Kerman who was assassinated along with his
    father, is one of the victims of a series of political killings that have
    come to be known as Chain Murders. Information regarding the life,
    activities, and murder of Karun Hajizadeh has been gathered from a
    multitude of sources including electronic communication (form) sent to the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) by a person close to him, Payam e
    Hajar weekly (Vol. 302, January 25, 2000), Ettela at daily newspaper
    (Saturday, October 3, 1998), memoirs and statements of his brother in his
    personal weblog entitled Karun, his aunt s account in the Farkhondeh
    Hajizadeh Website and in an interview with Roozonline (Sunday, December
    11, 2011), United Nations Special Representative s report (January 18,
    2000), and the books Sineye Sohrab ( Sohrab s Chest ) and Me, Mansur, and
    Albright , written by Farkhondeh Hajizadeh. Karun Hajizadeh was born in
    Kerman in 1989. He was the youngest of three boys in his family. Hi
    father, Hamid Hajizadeh, was a poet, writer, and literature teacher.
    According to his brother, Karun was very affectionate. He was particularly
    attached to his parents but also to his uncle whom he talked to on the
    phone every morning before leaving for school. He was studious, organized,
    and goodhearted. For example, if his mother bought a bunch of bananas and
    gave him one to take to school, he would take a few for his friends,
    hiding them under his shirts. I can t enjoy eating the banana if I am the
    only one having it , he told his mother when caught, but I do, if I share
    with them. (E-form sent to ABF) Short background on the Chain Murders
    Chain Murders refers to a set of disappearances and extra-judicial
    killings of writers and political dissidents which mainly occurred in the
    1990 s. In January 1999, the Ministry of Intelligence published an
    announcement in which it squarely put the blame for four such killings
    (those of Dariush and Parvaneh Foruhar, Mohammad Mokhtari, and Mohammad Ja
    far Puyandeh) on rogue elements within the Ministry, without providing any
    explanation as to the causes and manner of killing of tens of [other]
    dissidents and writers. A number of the Ministry of Intelligence agents
    were arrested and charged with the above-mentioned four persons murders.
    On June 20, 1999, it was announced that the primary suspect, Sa id Emami,
    had committed suicide in prison. According to the victims lawyers,
    numerous pages of Emami s confession had been deleted from the Chain
    Murders file. Based on independent research and the confessions of [a
    number of] the accused, however, the elimination of dissidents - the
    magnitude of which remains unknown - was the official policy of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran s Ministry of Information for over a decade.
    Karun and Hamid Hajizadeh s names were first mentioned as two of the
    victims of the Chain Murders in February 2000 in Payam e Hajar weekly
    magazine. Also, in January, the United Nations Special Rapporteur for
    human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran had called on the Iranian
    authorities to investigate the murders of more than fifty political
    dissidents: [t]here were demands that the investigation be broadened to
    include many other suspicious deaths going back to 1994 [involving] 50 or
    more unexplained deaths in recent years. Included were the 1994 deaths of
    three Christian ministers which had been officially attributed to the
    Mujahedin, the deaths of Sunni community leaders, and the deaths of
    dissidents in bombings in Europe (UN Special Representative Report,
    E/CN.4/2000/35, January 18, 2000) The Assassination On the night of
    September 22 (or early hours of September 23), 1998, Karun and his father
    Hamid Hajizadeh were savagely killed in their home located in Goldasht,
    Kerman. Ettela at October 3, 1998) According to the Medical Examiner s
    official report, Mr. Hajizadeh had been stabbed 10 times and his father,
    Hamid 27 times. Based on the available information, it appears that Mr.
    Hamid Hajizadeh was the killers target. Karun may have been killed because
    he was with his father that night or possibly because he could have
    identified his father s killers. Karun may have been killed because he was
    with his father, Mr. Hamid Hajizadeh , that night or possibly because he
    could have identified his father s killers According to Karun s aunt, the
    Medical Examiner [Office s] representative had determined that there had
    been three perpetrators and that they had even had tea prior to committing
    the murders. Karun s brothers, who were first at the scene of the murder,
    reported that their father s writings were dispersed around the bodies.
    Their mother was sleeping in another room and seemed unconscious. They
    could not wake her up. She was asleep at the time of the murder and was,
    according to them, sedated by the killers. (Report of Story 1 Sohrab s Che
