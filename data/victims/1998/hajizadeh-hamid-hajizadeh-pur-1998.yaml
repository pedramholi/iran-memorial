    was a promising literary talent in his youth, but after the cultural
    revolution he shunned literary salons and isolated himself, yet he
    continued to write poetry and Mr. Hamid Hajizadeh (Pur Hajizadeh), a
    writer, teacher, and poet with the nom de plume Sahar , and his young son,
    Karun, are two of the victims of a series of political killings that have
    come to be known as Chain Murders. Information regarding the life,
    activities, and murder of Karun Hajizadeh has been gathered from a
    multitude of sources including electronic communication (form) sent to the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) by a person close to him, Payam e
    Hajar weekly (Vol. 302, January 25, 2000), Ettela at daily newspaper
    (Saturday, October 3, 1998), memoirs and statements of his son in his
    personal weblog entitled Karun, his sister s account in the Farkhondeh
    Hajizadeh Website and in an interview with Roozonline (Sunday, December
    11, 2011), United Nations Special Representative s report (January 18,
    2000), and the books Sineye Sohrab ( Sohrab s Chest ) and Me, Mansur, and
    Albright , written by Farkhondeh Hajizadeh. Biography Born in the village
    of Bazanjan in Kerman Province, Mr. Hamid Hajizadeh was married and had
    three children. He obtained an associate degree in literature from
    Daneshsaraye Rahnamaiye Kerman ( Kerman Guidance School ) and continued
    his education after the revolution at Shahid Beheshti University, studying
    law. Prior to the Cultural Revolution, he was suspended for one semester
    because of his political activities. After the Cultural Revolution and the
    reopening of universities, he obtained a bachelor s degree in literature
    from Kerman s Shahid Bahonar University. He subsequently began teaching in
    Kerman s education system. (Farkhondeh Hajizadeh s website) According to a
    person close to him, Mr. Hajizadeh was a supporter and member of the
    National Front during his teenage and youth years. From 1977 through 1979,
    he was active in the city of Kerman s revolutionary struggles. After the
    [1979] Revolution, he abandoned politics, although he remained a supporter
    of the National Front. ( Payame Hajar , January 25, 2000) Professional
    Life Mr. Hajizadeh began his literary activities when he was still an
    adolescent, and obtained numerous prizes in literary contests. As a young
    man, he established the Literary Society of the Palace of the Young in the
    city of Shiraz. According to his sister (a writer and member of the Iran
    Writers Association,) he was a known literary figure in the 1970 s before
    the revolution. For years, his voice could be heard on [a radio program in
    Kerman called] Kerman Radio Book of Poems . ( Ettela at newspaper, October
    3, 1998, Roozonline, December 11, 2011) After the [1979] Revolution, he
    gradually became a recluse and no longer attended any literary gatherings.
    He was suspended from teaching for a while and when he began teaching
    again, he was exiled to [teach in] Kahnuj, one of Kerman Province s towns
    known for its harsh climate. According to the available information, Mr.
    Hajizadeh had lost his incentive to publish his works and spent the last
    years of his life in solitude and silence. Occasionally only, he would
    read his works to his friends and students. However, one month prior to
    his murder, he prepared a number of his poems for publication. Some of
    these poems were posthumously published in a book of poems entitled Karun
    dar man ast ( Karun is within me. ) Mr. Hajizadeh has left an extensive
    body of research and literary works behind, including the three-volume
    History of Opiates, and Luminaries Addicted to Opium, Dictionary of
    Bazanjan and Lak Folklore, Gypsies Don t Fall in Love, The Lost Song,
    Father, Without You into the End of Night, just to name a few. ( Karun
    weblog) Short background on the Chain Murders Chain Murders refers to a
    set of disappearances and extra-judicial killings of writers and political
    dissidents which mainly occurred in the 1990 s. In January 1999, the
    Ministry of Intelligence published an announcement in which it squarely
    put the blame for four such killings (those of Dariush and Parvaneh
    Foruhar, Mohammad Mokhtari, and Mohammad Ja far Puyandeh) on rogue
    elements within the Ministry, without providing any explanation as to the
    causes and manner of killing of tens of [other] dissidents and writers. A
    number of the Ministry of Intelligence agents were arrested and charged
    with the above-mentioned four persons murders. On June 20, 1999, it was
    announced that the primary suspect, Sa id Emami, had committed suicide in
    prison. According to the victims lawyers, numerous pages of Emami s
    confession had been deleted from the Chain Murders file. Based on
    independent research and the confessions of [a number of] the accused,
    however, the elimination of dissidents - the magnitude of which is still
    not clear - was the official policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran s
    Ministry of Information for over a decade. Mr. Hajizadeh and his son s
    names were first mentioned as two of the v
