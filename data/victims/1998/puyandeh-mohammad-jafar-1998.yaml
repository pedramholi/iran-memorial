    To help his family, he began taking jobs as a 10-year-old, while working
    harder at his studies. A sociologist and a translator, he translated human
    rights texts to make them accessible to Iranians.The release of his last
    translation, on Human Rights Day, coincided with his murder. Mr. Mohammad
    Ja far Puyandeh, writer, translator, and sociologist, is among the victims
    named in the 2000 Report of the United Nation s Special Representative.
    The report included his assassination in the string of disappearances and
    suspicious deaths in the second half of 1998 of intellectuals and
    dissident political figures. * Popular reaction , the Special
    Representative noted, was strong and immediate and became more so as it
    became clear that the killings were part of what became known as serial
    killings** committed by officials in or close to the Ministry of
    Information (Security). The information about this case has been drawn
    from several sources (see endnote). Mr. Mohammad Ja far Puyandeh was born
    in 1954 in Ashkazar (Yazd Province) in a disadvantaged family. When he was
    10 years old, he started working in addition to studying. He graduated
    from high school in 1970. He passed the national university entrance exam
    the same year and enrolled in Tehran University, majoring in judicial law.
    He was also politically active and opposed the previous regime. In 1974,
    he enrolled in Sorbonne University (Paris) to study sociology and
    graduated with a master s degree three years later. While pursuing his
    degree in France, he continued his political activism, along with other
    Iranian students outside Iran. He returned to Iran in August or September
    1978 (the introduction to Human Rights: Questions and Answers). Since age
    25, Mr. Puyandeh translated various writings from French to Farsi; he had
    translated more than 20 such works. His colleagues remember him as a
    hard-working and thorough translator. Some days, he worked for twenty
    hours at his old desk (the introduction to Human Rights: Questions and
    Answers). Mr. Puyandeh s focus in translation has been on women s rights
    and fighting discrimination based on sex; human rights; and Marxism. He
    dedicated his translation of Leah Levin s Human Rights: Questions and
    Answers to women and men who fight for the promotion and implementation of
    human rights. The enforcement of these rights is a prerequisite to the
    advancement and progress of human kind. This book, which was released on
    Human Rights Day, the same day Mr. Puyandeh was murdered, includes the
    Articles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and explains their
    meaning (Journalists Without Borders). Mr. Mohammad Ja far Puyandeh played
    a key role in the re-opening of the Iranian Writers Association,** * and
    can be described as one of the founding members of the Third Association.
    Almost one month before his death, he said in an interview: Any legal
    restraint on the freedom of expression leads to the repression of thoughts
    and ideas. Limiting freedom of expression should be beyond the reach of
    political regimes. Repression and censorship will bring about dire
    consequences, even if the state attempts to use them as tools to protect
    its people from corruption and perversion (Peyvand). Mr. Puyandeh also
    played a vital part in the writing and publication of a letter, dated
    October 15, 1994, consisting of objections of 134 writers to censorship
    and restraints on freedom of expression. This letter reads as follows: We
    are writers; that is, we write about and publish our feelings, thoughts,
    and research in various forms. It is our natural, social, and civil right
    to see our work be it poetry or fiction, plays or screenplays, criticism
    or research work, and even translation[s] of other writers work reach our
    readers freely and without restriction. No person or institution, under
    any pretext, should be allowed to hamper the publication of these works.
    Needless to say, any published work is open to free criticism and judgment
    by all. While obstacles which face us in our thinking and writing far
    exceed our individual means and power, we have no alternative but to
    confront them through collective professional channels, i.e. to unite in
    order to achieve freedom of thought and expression and to fight against
    censorship We reiterate that we are writers and expect to be seen as such,
    and that our collective presence [is] to be understood as the professional
    representation of Iranian writers (website of the Iranian Writers
    Association). In late September 1998, a few weeks prior to Mr. Puyandeh s
    murder, the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office had summoned him and
    five other writers (including Mr. Mohammad Mokhtari, another victim of the
    serial murders ), all of whom were members of the organizational committee
    of the Writers Association (Amnesty International, 1998). Murder In the
    afternoon of December 9, 1998, Mr. Mohammad Ja far Puyandeh left his house
    to attend a publishers meeting, and never returned. According to the
    testimony of his wife
