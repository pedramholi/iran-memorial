    She was a student of sociology, editorial board member of the Iran Nation
    Party, an outspoken advocate for democracy, a poet, and a mother.
    Relentless and fearless in her cause. Ms. Parvaneh Eskandari Foruhar, and
    her husband, Dariush Foruhar, are two of the victims named in the 2000
    Report of the United Nations Special Representative. The report included
    their assassination in the string of disappearances and suspicious deaths
    in the second half of 1998 of intellectuals and dissident political
    figures. * Popular reaction, the Special Representative noted, was strong
    and immediate and became more so as it became clear that the killings were
    part of what became known as serial killings** committed by officials in
    or close to the Ministry of Information (Security). The information
    regarding this case has been drawn from several sources (see endnote). Ms.
    Parvaneh Eskandari Foruhar was born on March 20, 1939, in Tehran. She
    studied at the School of Literature of Tehran University and became a
    student activist and a member of the Political Cultural Society of
    Anahita, which supported the Iran Nation Party. She was a sociology
    student in 1960. On April 23, 1961, she married Mr. Dariush Foruhar, who
    had co-founded the Iran Nation Party in 1951. They had two children
    (Parastu Foruhar s blog). Ms. Parvaneh Eskandari Foruhar was one of the
    first two women who became members of the (second) National Front s
    congress. Due to her political activism, she was arrested several times
    and lived underground for some time ( Iran Emrooz ). She was a member of
    the editorial board of the publications of the Iran Nation Party and
    published newsletters of the National Front until they were banned after
    the 1979 Revolution ( Mizan News ). She worked as a high school history
    teacher until 1970 when, following her husband s arrest, she was dismissed
    and banned from teaching. After her dismissal, she worked as an academic
    counselor (AUT News). Ms. Parvaneh Eskandari s daughter remembers her as
    an extremely sensitive and passionate woman who wrote poetry and loved
    literature ( Lilit ). She was known for her courage and her strong and
    supportive presence alongside Mr. Forouhar in the face of decades of
    hardship. Ms. and Mr. Foruhar were proponents of a democratic and
    independent Iran. They supported the separation of state and religion.
    They believed, and publicly stated, that the current structure of the
    state institutions in the Islamic Republic led to the concentration of
    power, and made reforms, particularly constitutional reforms, very
    difficult. With the relative opening of public space in the late 1990s,
    their persistent effort to promote their ideas attracted student groups
    who promoted democracy. The couple s funeral was attended by thousands of
    Iranian men and women who gathered spontaneously in spite of the
    overwhelming presence of security services. The Iran Nation Party was
    founded in 1951 as a result of a split from the Pan Iranist Party. The
    nationalist Iran Nation Party endorsed Dr. Mohammad Mossadeq s policies
    and actively resisted the coup of August 18, 1953, which overthrew the
    Mossadeq government. The Iran Nation Party excluded Pan Iranism from its
    ideology in 1961. The Iran Nation Party joined the National Front, which
    was led by Dr. Shapur Bakhtiar, Dariush Foruhar, and Dr. Karim Sanjabi.
    The Party remained a member of this coalition until the Revolution. In
    1979, the Iran Nation Party joined the Islamic Revolution forces and
    accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini. In June 1981, when the
    Iranian government intensified its oppression of political opposition and
    banned political parties, the Iran Nation Party limited its activities.
    The relative political opening that followed the presidential election of
    May 23, 1996, encouraged the Iran Nation Party to resume, unofficially,
    its activities in particular among students. Murders On November 22, 1998,
    the bodies of Ms. and Mr. Foruhar were found in their house in Tehran.
    Both had been brutally murdered and stabbed multiple times. Persons who
    saw Mr. Foruhar s body later told his daughter that her father s arm was
    broken though the official forensic report only mentioned the knife
    wounds. To this date, the exact circumstances of the Foruhars deaths
    remain unknown to their family. Following the murders, the couple s
    daughter, Parastu, was called in to identify the bodies. None of the
    family s friends were allowed to accompany her. She was taken to an
    ambulance, where her parents bodies were laid. The authorities hastened
    the process, transferring the bodies immediately after she signed the
    necessary documents, and rejected her request to stay a moment by her
    parents. The Foruhars children were denied, for a week, access to the
    family house which was left in a state of total chaos after the police
    search. Parastu Foruhar reported that documents and writings were
    confiscated and never returned to the family ( Melliun Iran ). State
