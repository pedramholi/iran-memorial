    Nuraddin Gharibi Khorasani: " I have many enemies. I'm a Sunni, and in
    Iran, the Shiite majority doesn't want me. No matter where I go in the
    world, they will kill me, because they have been following me in every
    country I've been to." Information regarding the extrajudicial execution
    of Mr. Nureddin Mohammad Gharibi Khorasani, son of Mohammad, was obtained
    from the Boroumand Center (ABC) interview with one of his close relatives
    (October 26 and February 20, 2024), interviews with two informed persons
    (February 1 and February 3, 2024), his death certificate, and the Facebook
    page of the campaign advocating the construction of a Sunni mosque in
    Tehran (March 18, 2013). Mr. Gharibi Khorasani was a 31-year-old Sunni
    Muslim from a village in Khorasan province (ABC interview with one of his
    close relatives, January 24, 2024). Mr. Gharibi pursued religious studies
    from an early age and was repeatedly summoned by the Khorasan security
    forces during his teenage years because of his religious activities. At
    the age of 17, he traveled to Pakistan to continue his religious education
    and spent a year at the Darul Uloom Islamic Seminary in Karachi. According
    to some reports, Mr. Gharibi Khorasani "did not return to Iran due to the
    dire situation for Sunnis in the country and interrogations by the
    Ministry of Intelligence, even while he was in Pakistan" (Facebook page of
    the Campaign for the Construction of a Sunni Mosque in Tehran, March 18,
    2013). Instead, he went directly to Saudi Arabia, where he continued his
    studies at the Islamic University of Medina (ABC interview with an
    informed person, February 1, 2024). After completing his education in
    Saudi Arabia, he moved to Kunduz, Afghanistan, with the help of a
    charitable organization (ABC Interview with an Informed Person, February
    1, 2024). Two years later, in the early Fall of 1996, he legally moved to
    Dushanbe, Tajikistan, where he began teaching the Quran and Arabic
    language. (ABC Interview with an Aide, 20 February 2024). He settled in
    Dushanbe, Tajikistan, where he married and had two children. He applied
    for permanent residency, but his residency documents were not issued until
    after his assassination (ABC interview with one of his close relatives,
    February 20, 2024). According to one of Mr. Gharibi Khorasani's close
    relatives, he often told his family that he had many enemies and that the
    Shiite population in Iran did not accept him because of his Sunni faith.
    He said, "I have many enemies. I am a Sunni, and in Iran, the Shiites
    don't want me. No matter where I go in the world, they will kill me,
    because they've been after me in every country I've been to. (ABC
    Interview, February 20, 2024). Mr. Gharibi Khorasani was described as a
    "kind, caring, and adorable person who was highly respected by those who
    knew him. (ABC Interview with a Close Relative, February 20, 2024).
    Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The
    Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated
    violence in Iran and around the world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic
    Republic operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in
    kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose
    activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of
    extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders
    began in February 1979 and have continued since then, both inside and
    outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far identified over
    540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran.
    Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic
    outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan,
    India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East;
    Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and
    Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean.
    In most cases, there has not been much published, and local authorities
    have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation, evidence, and traces
    obtained through investigations conducted by local police and judicial
    authorities confirm the theory of state committed crimes. In some
    instances, these investigations have resulted in the expulsion or arrest
    of Iranian diplomats. In a few cases outside Iran, the perpetrators of
    these murders have been arrested and put on trial. The evidence presented
    revealed the defendants connection to Iran s government institutions, and
    an arrest warrant has been issued for Iran s Minister of Information. The
    manner in which these killings were organized and implemented in Iran and
    abroad is indicative of a single pattern which, according to Roland
    Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor, contains common parameters and detailed
    planning. It can be ascertained from the similarities between these
    murders in different countries that the Iranian government is the
    principal entity that ordered the implementation of these
