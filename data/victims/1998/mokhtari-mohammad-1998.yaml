    Persian language and literature were his focus as were reviving the
    Iranian Writers Association and supporting the natural, social, and civil
    right to publish. Mr. Mohammad Mokhtari is among the victims named in the
    2000 Report of the United Nations Special Representative. The report
    included his assassination in the string of disappearances and suspicious
    deaths in the second half of 1998 of intellectuals and dissident political
    figures. * Popular reaction, the Special Representative noted, was strong
    and immediate and became more so as it became clear that the killings were
    part of what became known as serial killings ** committed by officials in
    or close to the Ministry of Information (Security). The information about
    this case has been drawn from various sources (see endnote). Mr. Mohammad
    Mokhtari was born in Mashhad on April 21, 1942. He graduated from Mashhad
    s Ferdosi University in 1969, majoring in Persian Language and Literature.
    He married in 1972 and had two sons ( Atiban , Wikipedia). In 1973, Mr.
    Mokhtari joined the literary foundation of Ferdosi s Shahnameh and soon
    became a member of its scientific committee. From 1979 until the beginning
    of the Cultural Revolution***, Mr. Mokhtari taught at the School of
    Dramatic Arts (today s School of Cinema and Theatre) of Tehran University.
    In 1981, he was the secretary of the Iranian Writers Association**** for
    one year. He was arrested in 1982 for political reasons and imprisoned for
    two years. He was also permanently banned from working for the government.
    From 1986, he was on the editorial board of the Donya-ye Sokhan magazine.
    He also had close ties with other publications such as Takapu . Mr.
    Mokhtari played a key role in the re-opening of the Iranian Writers
    Association. He was a long-time member of the Association and a central
    figure in the Third Iranian Writers Association. According to friends and
    acquaintances, he worked eagerly for the achievement of the goals of the
    Association, and followed its projects with patience and perseverance; his
    constructive and helpful criticism proved vital for the Association (Asr-e
    No). He also played a crucial part in the writing and publication of a
    letter, dated October 15, 1994, in which 134 writers stated their
    objection to censorship and restraints on the freedom of expression: We
    are writers; that is, we write about and publish our feelings, thoughts
    and research in various forms. It is our natural, social and civil right
    to see our work be it poetry or fiction, plays or screenplays, criticism
    or research work, and even translation[s] of other writers work reach our
    readers freely and without restriction. No person or institution, under
    any pretext, should be allowed to hamper the publication of these works.
    Needless to say, any published work is open to free criticism and judgment
    by all. While obstacles which face us in our thinking and writing far
    exceed our individual means and power, we have no alternative but to
    confront them through collective professional channels, i.e. to unite in
    order to achieve freedom of thought and expression and to fight against
    censorship We reiterate that we are writers and expect to be seen as such,
    and that our collective presence [is] to be understood as the professional
    representation of Iranian writers (website of the Iranian Writers
    Association). Mr. Mokhtari was a successful researcher and respected poet.
    He had published several books of poetry, as well as a book on mythology
    and the Shahnameh. In late September 1998, a few weeks prior to Mr.
    Mokhtari s murder, the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office summoned
    him and five other writers (including Mr. Mohammad Ja far Puyandeh,
    another victim of the serial murders ), all of whom were members of the
    organizational committee of the Writers Association (Amnesty
    International, 1998). Mr. Mokhtari s son has described the events leading
    to the proceedings: A young man came to the door to deliver the court
    summons. He emphasized that there was no need to worry. At the court, my
    father found out that there was a case against him, and the authorities
    told him that he should realize that he was being tried. The verdict of
    the court is not known. Murder On December 3, 1998, Mr. Mokhtari left his
    house for shopping and never returned. The next day, police officers of
    Aminabad found an unidentified body in an uninhabited area of Aminabad, on
    the estate of a cement factory, near the road to Firuzabad (near Tehran
    City). There was nothing to help identify the body, other than a pen and a
    piece of paper. The body was transferred to the police station s forensic
    team. One week after the disappearance of Mr. Mokhtari, on December 10
    (the International Human Rights Day), Mr. Mokhtari s son, Siavash,
    identified his body at the morgue of the police station. He had been
    strangled on December 3 (testimony of Sohrab Mokhtari; Amnesty
    International, 1988). State Investigation Prior to Mr. Mokhtari s murder,
