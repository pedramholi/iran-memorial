    News of the execution of Mr. Baqi Rahimi was announced by the office of
    the Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan. Additional information was taken
    from the ABF interview with a member of this organization in Saqez and the
    Komala Office in Erbil, Iraq, and with a relative of Mr. Rahimi. Mr.
    Rahimi, known as Chia, 21, was single and from the Chichuran Village near
    Baneh in Kurdistan. He had a middle school education. According to the
    Komala Party in Kurdistan, Mr. Rahimi joined the party and served for five
    years in Baneh and the surrounding area. In 2000, he became a Peshmerga
    and was active for a year as a Peshmerga in Komala. In the mid 1960 s,
    several remaining members of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran
    established the Revolutionary Organization of this party in Iraq. Among
    its leaders were Esma il Sharifzadeh, Abdollah Mo ini, and Mola avareh,
    who began an armed guerrilla struggle in Kurdistan inspired by the Cuban
    Revolution. The group was defeated in 1969 and several of its members
    arrested. The Revolutionary Organization of Working People in Kurdistan
    (Komala) was established upon the release of a number of the leaders in
    1978. After the revolution, in accordance with Marxist theory, Komala
    opposed capitalists and landlords, and encouraged workers and peasants in
    Kurdistan, in particular in the city of Sanandaj and vicinity where they
    had strong support, to initiate an armed uprising against capitalists,
    landlords and the central government. In 1982, Komala joined another
    Marxist group, Sahand, an organization concentrating mainly on theory and
    ideology, and established the Communist Party of Iran. Komala subsequently
    adopted the name The Kurdistan Organization of the Communist Party of
    Iran, Komala. By the mid-1980s, the central government had succeeded in
    pushing Komala fighters out of Kurdistan and into Northern Iraq. Years
    later, Komala split from the Communist Party of Iran and faced several
    schisms, each continuing to use the name Komala. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Rahimi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Rahimi s trial. Charges According to the
    Komala Office in Arbil, the charge against Mr. Rahimi was announced as
    membership in Komala. No detail information is available regarding his
    charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Rahimi.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Rahimi s defense. Judgment Mr.
    Baqi Rahimi was hanged, along with Mr. Abbas Karimi, another member of the
    Komala, at the Saqez Prison on April 30, 2001. There is no information on
    the verdict leading to this execution or his burial location.
