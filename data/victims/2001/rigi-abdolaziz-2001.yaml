    Abdolaziz Rigi was married and he worked at the Zahedan Bazaar. He worked
    at a sofa making shop for a while, and he also conducted business in the
    border areas between Iran with Pakistan and Afghanistan. Information
    regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Abdolaziz Rigi, son of Azad,
    has been obtained from an interview with a relative and with an informed
    source (September 10, 2021; October 10, 2023). Additional background
    information was gleaned from Police Information Website (July 3, 2005), Al
    Monitor Website (2017), Minority Rights Group International Organization
    report (2018), and Human Rights Watch Organization report (1997). Mr.
    Abdolaziz Rigi was born in 1977, in a Baluch Sunni family in Zahedan. He
    completed his high school education in his hometown Zahedan. Mr. Rigi was
    married and he worked at the bazaar in Zahedan. He worked for a while in a
    sofa making shop. He also conducted business at the border areas between
    Iran with Pakistan and Afghanistan (Interview with a relative, September
    10, 2021). Mr. Rigi was the third eldest child in a family of thirteen
    siblings. According to an informed source, Abdolaziz Rigi was not a member
    of any political group or organization. However, like many others during
    those years, when security was tight and Baluchi youth were killed in
    random shootings he was against the government (Interview with an informed
    source, Oct 10, 2023). The Baluch in Iran Believed to make up one to three
    percent of the country s population (ABC), Baluchi ethnic groups make up
    the majority of the population in Sistan-Baluchistan, where 64-77 percent
    of residents live below the poverty line. Despite having abundant gas,
    oil, gold, and marine resources, approximately two thirds of residents
    lack access to clean drinking water, and economic policies have allowed it
    to remain one of the poorest-sourced provinces in education, health, and
    food. Civil unrest in the region has given way to militant opposition
    groups and fatal skirmishes. In moving to bring the region under tighter
    control, the government has resorted to violence, including
    assassinations, as well as arbitrary arrests of peaceful human rights
    defenders. Ten Baluch civil rights activists were arbitrarily detained
    between March and September of 2017 alone (MRG). Iran's Baluch minority
    are mostly Sunni Muslims, whereas the majority of Iran s population are
    Shi'a Muslims. Policies and actions from authorities have been restrictive
    toward the practice of Sunni Islam, e.g. limiting and even blocking the
    construction of Sunni mosques in majority-Sh ia areas (including Tehran),
    arbitrary closure of Sunni prayer halls and celebratory gatherings, and
    violence from security forces towards groups of Sunnis praying in public
    (MRG, HRW: Religious Minorities, AL). Lack of institutional support pushes
    Sunni leaders to pursue study in Pakistan or Saudi Arabia, a trend which
    has historically aroused government suspicion due both to the hostility of
    Wahabism (the dominant branch of Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia) towards
    Shiism, and to the political tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
    Baluch activists reported that government repression of Sunni Baluch
    groups had increased since February 1994, when locals gathered at Zahedan,
    the capital of Sistan-Baluchistan, to protest the destruction of a Sunni
    mosque in Mashhad. Government agents reportedly fired shots into the crowd
    and detained several activists (HRW: Ethnic Minorities). Dr. Sayyad was
    one of four Sunni clerics of Baluch or Kurd descent to die in suspicious
    circumstances between 1994 and 1996 (UN, BC article 2/14/16). Background
    of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic
    Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated violence in
    Iran and around the world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic
    operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in kidnapping,
    disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose activities
    they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial
    killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders began in
    February 1979 and have continued since then, both inside and outside Iran.
    The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings
    outside Iran attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have
    been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
    in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France,
    Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in
    Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases,
    there has not been much published, and local authorities have not issued
    arrest warrants. But documentation, evidence, and traces obtained through
    investigations conducted by local police and judicial authorities confirm
    the theory of state committed crimes. In some instances, these
