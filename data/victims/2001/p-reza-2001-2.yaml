circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Reza P., a conscript, was published in the
    Kayhan newspaper on July 30, 2001. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Reza P. s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 13 of
    the Public Court of Ahvaz tried Mr. Reza P. No information is available on
    his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Reza P. was announced as
    murder. According to the report, planning to murder, he went to a friend s
    house and murdered him by several blows of a knife. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Reza P. Defense No information is available on Mr. Reza P s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Reza P. to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in Ahvaz in July of 2001. The exact
    date of this execution is unknown.
