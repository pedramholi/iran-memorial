    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan Saguri Khasraji, along with another
    person, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on May 13, 2001. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Saguri Khasrji s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Dezful tried Mr.
    Saguri Khasrji. No information is available on his trial. Charges The
    charges brought against Mr. Saguri Khasrji were announced as murder,
    creating public intimidation and fear, stealing several motorcycles,
    assault and battery, and damaging the Jihad Sazandegi properties in
    Orumieh. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Saguri Khasrji. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Saguri Khasrji s defense. Judgment The court identified Mr. Hassan
    Saguri Khasrji as a Mohareb [fighter against God] and condemned him to
    death. He was hanged, along with another person, at Fatholmobin Square in
    Dezful on May 13, 2001.
