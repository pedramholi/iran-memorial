    town of Sahneh in Kermanshah Province, in a Kurdish family that belonged
    to the Yarsan religious minority group in1957. He was a prominent musician
    and master of Tanbur, [an ancient Iranian string instrument]. At the age
    of 17, he studied the various modes of the Yarsan creed s music, and
    started learning to play Tar and Setar [both Iranian string instruments].
    In 1975, he performed for the first time with the Kermanshahan Modal Music
    Group at Tehran s Rudaki Hall. Mr. Alinejad studied music and graduated
    from Tehran University Arts Department. While in college, he was in
    Tanburnavazan ( Tanbur Players ) Group, led by Kaykhosro Purnazeri. (Info
    Sufi website, Hayate No newspaper). Mr. Alinejad wrote poetry, knew
    ancient texts, and had a great knowledge of Persian and Kurdish ancient
    texts. Yarsan people remember him as a free-spirited wayfarer of morality
    and mysticism, a prominent master of modal and national music, and an
    enlightened and pragmatic [mystic] elder. (Iran newspaper, November 24,
    2001; Info Sufi, November 18, 2018). The Tanbur is a holy instrument in
    the Yari creed and Mr. Alinejad was one of its greatest players. With the
    exception of private concerts, he never appeared on stage without the
    Tanbur. Mr. Alinejad s special skills were not limited to music and the
    collection of [ancient] songs, tales, dreams, and the creed s musical
    modes: He was also learned in science and astronomy. The culmination of
    his research was the revival of the Kurdish Soltani Calendar, in the
    introduction to which he wrote [this] was a step in the revival of Iran s
    ancient calendar . (Iran and Hayate No newspapers). Mr. Alinejad published
    another book in 2005 called Resaleh Yari which provides a general
    information regarding the Yarsan. Mr. Alinejad spent many years collecting
    and researching different methods of playing the Tanbur in the Kurdistan
    region, and his work resulted in a book entitled Tanbur az Dirbaz ta Konun
    ( Tanbur from Ancient Times to the Present ) and in his special way of
    playing [the instrument] solo. The book, at the time of publication, was
    the only source of and reference for Tanbur-based music. Nevertheless,
    during his lifetime, aside from a solo performance named Shokraneh, none
    of his solo performances had the chance to be published, even though he
    played as a solo Tanbur player accompanying the rest of the group on the
    album Seda-ye Sokhan-e Eshgh ( The Sound of Love Speak ), Shams Music
    Group s first album. (Iran newspaper, Tasnim News Agency ABC interview,
    November 19, 2021). Mr. Alinejad and Seyed Yareh Shah Ebrahimi, also a
    Yarsan influential personality and musician, were arrested in 19709 or
    1980 and were released a short time later. It is said that these arrests
    were all related to the unsuccessful Nojeh Coup and although most of the
    arrestees were released after a while, Seyed Yareh was sentenced to death
    and immediately executed. (Boroumand Center interview, May 23, 2021 and
    November 19, 2021). In 1994, Mr. Alinejad went to the Capital and lived in
    Tehran s for years including in Sa adatabad neighborhood. The main reason
    for his migration to Tehran is not known; however, according to people
