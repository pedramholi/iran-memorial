    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan Molapur, along with two others, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on October 25, 2001. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of Mr. Molapur s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Branch 1602 of the Tehran Criminal Court tried Mr. Molapur. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Molapur was announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Molapur. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Molapur s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hassan Molapur
    to death. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at the
    Qasr Prison yard on October 24, 2001.
