    News of the execution of Mr. Mohsen Zolfaqar, son of Ali, along with
    another person, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on December
    9, 2001, quoting the Information Committee of the Qom Courthouse. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of Mr. Zolfaqar s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial Branch 35 of the Public Court of Qom tried Mr. Zolfaqar.
    No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought
    against Mr. Zolfaqar were announced as rape, and participation in robbery
    with harassment. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Zolfaqar was his confession and the confession of his collaborator.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Zolfaqar s
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohsen Zolfaqar to death for
    rape; to 10 years imprisonment and 74 lashes for participation in robbery
    with harassment; and to 2 years imprisonment, 74 lashes, and exile from
    the Qom province for 50 years for threatening with a knife. The Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling. He was executed in public at Yazdanshahr
    Square in Qom on December 8, 2001. According to the report, he was
    arrested, prosecuted, and executed in less than 20 days.
