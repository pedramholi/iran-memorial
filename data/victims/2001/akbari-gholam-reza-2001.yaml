    News of the execution of Mr. Gholam Reza Akbari, son of Abolhassan, along
    with another person, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    December 9, 2001, quoting the Information Committee of the Qom Courthouse.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Akbari s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch 35 of the Public Court of Qom tried
    Mr. Akbari. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Akbari were announced as rape, and participation in
    robbery with harassment. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Akbari was his confession and the confession of his
    collaborator. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Akbari s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Gholam Reza Akbari
    to death for rape; to 10 years imprisonment, 75 lashes, and exile from the
    Qom province for 50 years for robbery with harassment. The Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was executed in public at Yazdanshahr Square in
    Qom on December 8, 2001. According to the report, he was arrested,
    prosecuted, and executed in less than 20 days.
