    News of the execution of Mr. Sharif Alizehi, an Afghan citizen, was
    published in the Ettela at newspapers on February 18, 2001. Arrest and
    detention According to the report, Mr. Alizehi was identified and arrested
    in Tehran on October 17, 2000. He was transferred to Birjand. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Alizehi s trial. Chares The charge brought
    against Mr. Alizehi was announced as rape. According to the newspaper
    report, on April 14, 2000, three armed Afghan individuals entered the
    house of a resident in the Seyedabad Village near Birjand at night. They
    tied the hands and feet of the head of household and took him outside.
    They beat up his wife and children, then raped his 16-year-old daughter.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Alizehi was his confession. According to the report, he confessed to this
    charge in addition to armed smuggling of 75 kilograms of opium into the
    country in collaboration with four others. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Alizehi s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Sharif Alizehi to death. He was executed in Birjand on February 13, 2001.
