    female tenant in his residential building for her over-use of water during

    death. He was hanged at the Babol Prison yard after five years when the
    victim s family paid a half of the blood money (Diyeh) for a man.* No
    specific date is available about his execution. *In the Iranian legal
    system, women s blood money is considered half of a man. Therefore, for
    carrying out the execution ruling, the victim s family is responsible to
    pay the other half since the victim was a woman.
