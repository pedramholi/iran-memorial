    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Azim Afghan (Teimuri), along with
    three others, was published in the Ettela at and Kayhan newspapers on
    April 30, 2001, quoting the News and Information Office of the Judiciary.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Afghan (Teimuri) s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Birjand tried Mr. Afghan (Teimuri). No information is available on his
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Afghan (Teimuri) was
    announced as drug trafficking. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Afghan (Teimuri).
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Afghan (Teimuri) s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad Azim Afghan (Teimuri) to death
    and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was executed in public in
    Birjand on April 25, 2001.
