    News of the execution of Mr. Elias Lotf alian, 19, a resident of
    Najafabad, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on January 4 and
    8, 2001. Arrest and detention According to the report, after Mr. Lotf
    alian committed robbery and murder on December 17, 2000, he kidnapped a
    girl student and attempted to escape with her in a car. However, some
    people arrested and took him to the police. The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Special Branch of the
    Esfahan Courthouse tried Mr. Lotf alian. No information is available on
    his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Lotf alian was announced
    as murder. According to the newspaper report, he had committed a murder at
    Apadana Street in Esfahan during a robbery on December 17, 2000. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Lotf alian. Defense No information is available on Mr. Lotf alian s
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Elias Lotf alian to death and
    the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public at Feiz
    Square in Esfahan on January 2, 2001, only 16 days after his arrest.
