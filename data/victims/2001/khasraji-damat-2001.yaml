    News of the execution of Mr. Damat Khasrji, along with another person, was
    published in the Kayhan newspaper on May 13, 2001. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of Mr. Khasrji s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Dezful tried Mr. Khasrji. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against
    Mr. Khasrji were announced as murder, creating public intimidation and
    fear, stealing several motorcycles, assault and battery, and damaging the
    Jihad Sazandegi properties in Orumieh. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Khasrji. Defense No information is available on Mr. Khasrji s defense.
    Judgment The court identified Mr. Damat Khasrji as a Mohareb [fighter
    against God] and condemned him to death. He was hanged, along with another
    person, at Fatholmobin Square in Dezful on May 13, 2001.
