    He was a funny person, had a sense of humor, and used to draw cartoons. A
    sensitivity to political issues ran in his family, but they had no
    religious leanings. Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC) was informed of Mr.
    Anvar Javanmardi s execution by his sister on January 19, 2018. Additional
    information on Mr. Javanmardi s case was obtained by ABC through an
    interview with his sister as well as independent research. Mr. Anvar
    Javanmardi, 22, son of Hossein, was from Saqez. His father was an
    architect and his mother a homemaker. He was the second child of the
    family and had two sisters and two brothers. His family had an average
    standing with regard to finances, and were sensitive to political issues,
    but had no religious leanings. Mr. Javanmardi had a high school diploma
    and used to work in an electrical appliance shop with his friends. He was
    a funny person, had a sense of humor, and used to draw cartoons. According
    to available information, Mr. Javanmardi was arrested for 40 days by the
    Ministry of Information office of Kurdistan when he was an adolescent due
    to his advocating for the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan. During
    his detention he was tortured and then released on bail, though he was
    repeatedly summoned to the branch afterwards. As a result, he was forced
    to flee to Iraqi Kurdistan, and then became a party member. Mr. Javanmardi
    returned to Iran in 1995 and along with some of his friends started to
    advertise for the party in the city of Sardasht by distributing party
    announcements. Arrest and Detention Mr. Javanmardi was arrested either by
    the agents of the Ministry of Intelligence or the Revolutionary Guards
    Intelligence Branch near the end of the fall or the beginning of the
    winter of 1995. According to available information, he was beaten during
    his arrest. His family were informed of his arrest by one of his friends,
    and despite almost three months of serious follow-up they were unable to
    get any news about their son. According to Mr. Javanmardi s sister, the
    family would go to the Intelligence Branch of Sardasht to inquire about
    the whereabouts of their son, but the authorities would respond that there
    was no such person there. Nevertheless, the Intelligence Branch kept
    contacting, summoning, and interrogating Javanmardi s father. Mr.
    Javanmardi was kept in custody between five and six months in a small
    unnamed prison in Sardasht. The first meeting of Mr. Javanmardi with his
    family occurred after three months in that prison. His mother and sister
    saw him once behind bars for 10 minutes in Sardasht Prison, separated from
    him by a corridor in which an agent had been posted. According to
    available information, the physical condition of Mr. Javanmardi was poor
    during that meeting, so much so that he could not stand on his feet.
    According to his sister, he was blindfolded during the meeting, and the
    agents only took off the blindfold at his mother s plea. He had been
    harshly tortured, his head was bandaged, and his face and the area below
    his eyes were discolored and swollen. He could not speak with ease, and
    would have to grab the bars in order not to fall. He would limp when
    walking. He had a pair of Kurdish pants and a milky-white shirt on during
    the meeting. Despite his bad condition, Mr. Javanmardi would comfort his
    mother and ask her not to cry, telling her that he would soon be released.
    After that meeting, Mr. Javanmardi was moved to a prison in the Mahabad
    Garrison Complex for two months. During that time, he met his mother,
    sister, and father once. Mr. Javanmardi was then moved to Darya Prison in
    Urmia, and was kept there until the end of June 2001. While there, Mr.
    Javanmardi was rarely allowed to meet his family; only once a month and
    sometimes once in every two or three months. During the meetings, there
    was always an agent present, so the family could not speak at ease.
    Javanmardi was allowed to call his family every two weeks. He was for a
    while kept in the basement of the prison in Ward 12 Coupe 3, the political
    prisoners ward, and was hardly allowed to use the open space. Mr.
    Javanmardi was then moved to the criminal ward where the murderers and
    narcotics-related prisoners were kept. According to his sister, during
    that that period Javanmardi had a difficult time and suffered abuse. In
    one of their meetings he told his sister, Here in this prison we are ten
    times more the prisoners of the inmates than the regime. According to
    available information, the quality of the prison food was poor and he had
    to acquire everything he needed by paying money. The prison was infested
    with lice and HIV-positive inmates were kept together with other prisoners
    in un-hygienic conditions. During his detention Mr. Javanmardi was not
    allowed to use the open space, as a result of which his face lost color.
    Trial Mr. Javanmardi s case was open in the jurisdiction of the Branch Two
    Revolutionary Court of Urmia. According to his sister, the family never
    received a verdict. Mr. Javanmardi had been as
