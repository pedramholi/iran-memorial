    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Akbar Karami, from Ilam, along with seven
    others, was published in the Iran newspaper on July 19, 2001. Additional
    information regarding his arrest and prosecution was taken from the Ettela
    at newspaper on May 1, September 24, October 3, 2000, and January 3, 2001.
    Arrest and detention According to the Ettela at newspaper, quoting the
    Head of Intelligence Police in Tehran, in April 2000, authorities were
    informed that a man, named Dr. Foruhari, was murdered at his residence
    while his hands and legs were cuffed and after his face and neck were
    injured. Following the investigation by inspectors of the Intelligence
    Police in Tehran and tracking of stolen cell phones, four individuals
    including Mr. Karami were identified and arrested. The circumstances and
    date of Mr. Karami s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 1601
    of the Criminal Court of Tehran tried Mr. Karami. According to the Ettela
    at newspaper on September 24, 2000, the victim s mother demanded the death
    penalty for defendants at the beginning of the trial. Then the defendants
    began their defense. No information is available on this trial. Charges
    The charges brought against Mr. Karami were announced as murder and
    robbery. According to the media reports, he and his collaborators entered
    Dr. Foruhari s house for robbery in March of 2000. They cuffed the victim
    s hands and legs, suffocated him, and escaped after stealing some money
    and belongings. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Karami
    was his confession and the confession of his collaborators. International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    According to the Ettela at newspaper on September 24, 2000, in his
    defense, Mr. Karami stated: Parviz suggested robbing the Doctor s house.
    There were five of us who went to the house. After identifying the
    location and making sure that there was no janitor, Kosar and I using the
    gas pipe, ascended to the rooftop and entered the yard. Majid followed us.
    We searched the rooms and found the Doctor in the bedroom. I held his
    hands and Kosar tied his legs. Then we shut his mouth with a handkerchief.
    We left after robbing the house. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ali
    Akbar Karami to death, 10 years imprisonment, and 154 lashes. The Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling He was hanged at the Qasr Prison yard in Tehran
    on July 18, 2001.
