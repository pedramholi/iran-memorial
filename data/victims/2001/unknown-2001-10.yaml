# --- DEATH ---
date_of_death: 2001-05-21
age_at_death: 35
place_of_death: "Tehran"
province: "Tehran"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Stoning"
circumstances: >
    The news of this execution was reported in an Amnesty International urgent
    action dated 11 July 2001 based on newspaper reports of May 21, 2001. This
    un-named woman was reportedly executed after serving eight years. Amnesty
    notes that "stoning to death is the punishment for adultry under the
    Iranian Penal Code. According to the Penal Code, men should be buried in a
    pit in the ground up to their waists, and women buried up to their chests.
    Individuals who manage to dig themselves out and escape from the pit
    whilst the stoning is being carried out have their lives spared. Article
    104 of the Penal Code states that ...stones should not be too large so
    that the person dies on being hit by one or two of them... and is designed
    to cause grievous pain leading to eventual death". ...An article
    concerning this urgent action was published in the [English-language]
    Tehran Times newspaper on 18 January. It stated that The West
    intentionally wants to interfere in internal matters of Iran, leveling
    baseless charges. It also said, Such a move by Amnesty is nothing but open
    interference in Iran's internal affairs. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of
    the basic guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    charge against the defendant is being "corrupt on earth" for appearing in
    a pornographic film. Evidence of guilt The reported evidence presented
    against the defendant is a witness testimony that she was the woman in the
    film. Defense The defendant reportedly denied any involvement in the film.
    There is no further information on her defense. Judgment The defendent was
    convicted of corruption on earth, and sentenced to eight years in prison
    followed by death by stoning, carried out sometime before May 21, 2001.
    Her sentence was appealed and upheld by the Iranian Supreme Court.
