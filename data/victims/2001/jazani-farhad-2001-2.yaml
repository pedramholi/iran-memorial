    News and information regarding the execution of Mr. Farhad Jazani was sent
    to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center by a person who knew him via an electronic
    form on June 19, 2018 (E-from 06/19/2018). News of this execution, along
    with three others, was also published in the Iran newspaper on June 21,
    2001. Additional information was taken from the Iran newspaper on June 20,
    2001. Mr. Jazani s case was related to an armed robbery and murder. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Jazani was arrested in Janat Abad in Tehran. (e-form
    06/19/2018) There is no further information available on his arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on Mr. Jazani s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Jazani was announced as Armed
    Robbery and murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Jazani. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Jazani s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Farhad Jazani to
    death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at the
    Qasr Prison yard on June 20, 2001.
