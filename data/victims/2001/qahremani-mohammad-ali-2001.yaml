    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Qahremani was published in the
    Ettela at newspaper on February 11, 2001. Arrest and detention According
    to the report, Mr. Qahremani was identified and arrested by security
    forces in Damavand 48 hours after committing the crime. The circumstances
    of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Qahremani s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr.
    Qahremani was announced as murder. According to the report, with the
    assistance of his wife, Mr. Qahremani had murdered five members of a
    family and stolen their belongings in a residential villa at Ahmadabad
    area in Damavand in the summer of 1998. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Qahremani. Defense No information is available on Mr. Qahremani s defense.
    Judgment A court condemned Mr. Mohammad Ali Qahremani to death and he was
    hanged in public at Qods Square in Damavand where the crime was committed,
    on February 10, 2001.
