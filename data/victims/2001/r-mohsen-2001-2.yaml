    News of the execution of Mr. Mohsen R., a state employee, along with two
    others, was published in the Iran and Ettela at newspapers on October 23,
    2001. Additional information was taken from the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper
    on August 23, 1999. Mr. Mohsen R. was an ex-employee of the Prisons
    Organization. His case was related to the kidnapping and murder of several
    women in Tehran. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Mohsen R. s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 1413 of the Special Court
    for State Employees tried Mr. Mohsen R.. No information is available on
    his trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Mohsen R. and his collaborators
    were collectively announced as rape, kidnapping, carjacking of a vehicle
    belonging to the Evin Prison, interfering with policing, and illegitimate
    relationships. According to the Public Relations Office of Tehran
    Provincial Courthouse, Mr. Mohsen R. and his seven collaborators stole a
    police radio device and a vehicle belonging to the Prisons Organization
    and installed a rotating light and a forged license plate, and pretended
    to be police and Basiji agents, stopping cars for extortion with assault
    and battery in some cases. Mr. Mohsen R. was also charged that he and two
    other defendants had kidnapped several young girls and women, taken them
    to predetermined locations, and raped them. (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper) The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence provided against Mr.
    Mohsen R. included a police radio device and a vehicle belonging to the
    Prisons Organization with and installed rotating light and a forged
    license plate. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohsen R. s
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohsen R. to death for rape, to
    15 years imprisonment for kidnapping, to one year imprisonment and 40
    lashes for carjacking of a vehicle belonging to the Evin Prison, to six
    months imprisonment for interfering with policing, and to 100 lashes for
    illegitimate relationships. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged at the Evin Prison yard on October 22, 2001.
