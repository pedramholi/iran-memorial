    Molavi Musa Karampur served as the Imam of Friday prayer at the Sheikh
    Feiz Mohammad Sunni mosque in Mashhad. The mosque was a place of worship
    for Sunnis from various regions and Afghanistan. The mosque was destroyed,
    and a tree was planted in its place. Additionally, the Imam of Friday
    prayer was expelled from Iran. However, this action did not satisfy the
    perpetrators. Information about the extrajudicial execution of Mr. Musa
    Karampur, son of Ahmad, was gathered by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center
    (ABC) through interviews with one of his close friends on December 9,
    2022, and another acquaintance on October 17, 2023, and from the Islamic
    Republic News Agency - IRNA (May 8, 2001). Additional details about his
    assassination were obtained from Mr. Karampur's speech in Herat,
    Afghanistan on March 9, 2000, his book "The Last Cry of the Martyred
    Sheikh Feiz Mohammad Mosque*" (published in 2006), Hamshahri Newspaper
    (May 6, 2001), information written on his gravestone, and the websites and
    Facebook pages of the Baloch Activists Campaign (February 2, 2015) and
    Radio Azadi (December 29, 2018). Mr. Musa Karampur, born in 1962, was a
    Sunni cleric from the village of Shahrabad, a district of Torbat-e Jam in
    Razavi Khorasan Province (according to the information on his tombstone).
    He was married and had six children. (Interview with ABC, October 17,
    2023) Molavi Karampur began his religious education at the age of 12 at
    the religious school in Torbat-e Jam. He was first arrested in 1981 in the
    middle of a sermon at the mosque. While still a student, he was imprisoned
    in Vakilabad prison in Mashhad and released after 40 days (ABC's Interview
    with a close friend, December 9, 2022). He later wrote about those 40 days
    in his book (The Last Cry), describing how security officials pressured
    his weaknesses to the point that he repeatedly wished for death. According
    to a friend, during his detention, Mr. Karampur was forced to swear to
    cooperate with the security officials, so he advised other clerics not to
    speak against the Islamic Republic in his presence to avoid lying. (ABC's
    Interview with a close friend, December 9, 2022). In 1984, Mr. Karampur
    went to the Darul Uloom School in Karachi, Pakistan, for one year to
    complete his religious studies. He believed that he was being monitored by
    one of his roommates during his studies in Pakistan, a fact that he
    realized in later interrogations (book The Last Cry). Upon returning to
    Iran in 1985, he resumed his religious activities, initially delivering
    sermons at Mehrabad Mosque in Mashhad. In 1989, he was appointed as the
    imam of Sheikh Feiz Mohammad Mosque, which was regarded as a "point of
    communication" and the "heart of the Sunni community."(The Last Cry book).
    In a televised interview, Abdollah Heidari, director of the Center for
    Thought and Dialogue Studies and a classmate and friend of Molavi
    Karampur, discussed his capabilities and activities. Heidari noted that
    Molavi Karampur, initially an unknown young man, was transferred to Sheikh
    Feiz Mohammad Mosque. However, due to his erudition and exemplary academic
    performance, he leveraged the mosque as a cultural hub, drawing in young
    people through a range of religious classes and programs (Kalameh Global
    Network, Silent Scream Special Program, February 21, 2013). As the Imam of
    the Sheikh Feiz Mohammad Mosque, he was very popular and eloquent, with
    one close friend describing him as "our leader and spokesman...we never
    tired of his speeches and meetings." (ABC's Interview with a Close Friend,
    December 9, 2022). During his tenure at the Sheikh Feiz Mohammad Mosque,
    he was repeatedly summoned and interrogated by security officials, writing
    in his book, "The intelligence service summoned me several times a week,
    blindfolded me, and attacked me like rabid dogs, torturing me in ways that
    make me tremble just thinking about it. (Karampur s speech, March 9,
    2000). In 1993, the Mashhad Municipality, backed by security and military
    forces, demolished the Sheikh Feiz Mohammad Mosque. To prevent the
    demolition, Mr. Karampur collected fatwas from influential Sunni scholars
    stating that the demolition was un-Islamic, illegal, and impermissible.
    However, upon learning of this, the intelligence officials arrested him
    and confiscated the scroll containing the collected fatwas (Kalameh Global
    Network, Silent Scream Special Program, February 21, 2013). Aware that the
    demolition of the mosque would provoke Sunni protests, days before the
    demolition, intelligence security officials circulated forged letters
    purportedly signed by Molavi Karampur indicating his consent to the sale
    and demolition of the mosque. This act was intended to defame him among
    his followers and incite protesters against him (Karampur's speech, March
    9, 2000). According to Mr. Karampur, during an interrogation before the
    demolition, the intelligence officials asked him hypothetically, "If the
    Supreme Leader orders the demolition of the mosque, what is your opinion?"
