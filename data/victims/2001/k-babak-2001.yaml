    News of the execution of Mr. Babak K. was published in the Iran and
    Jame-Jam newspapers on November 15 and 21 2001, respectively. Additional
    information was taken from the Iran newspaper on April 8 and 9, July 5,
    and November 6, 2001. Mr. Babak K., 30, was a servant in an
    air-conditioner producing company in Damavand. According to a relative, he
    and his brother-in-law had a camera repair shop as partners and had
    separated due to financial problems. Mr. Babak K. s family rejected him
    due to addiction and moral issues, and did not approve his marriage to the
    girl he loved (Iran newspaper on April 8 and 9, 2001). According to the
    existing information, Mr. Babak K. s case was related to the disappearance
    and murder of his niece-in-law on April 3, 2001. Arrest and Detention Mr.
    Babak K. was arrested by agents of Police Station 110 around Baharestan
    Square in Tehran on April 7, 2001, four days after the disappearance of
    his niece-in-law (Negin). Mr. Babak K. first denied having any information
    about Negin. After what the reports described as expert interrogations, he
    later stated, however, that after kidnapping Negin, he had released her on
    a street in Tehran. During further interrogation, Mr. Babak K. claimed
    that he had imprisoned his niece at an abandoned house at Behbahani, a
    dead end street near Naser Khosro Street. Police detectives, along with
    Mr. Babak, went to the location and recovered the body of the girl (Iran
    newspaper on April 8 and 9, 2001). Trial Branch 1601 of the Criminal Court
    of Tehran tried Mr. Babak K.. No further information is available on his
    trial, but according to Jame-Jam newspaper he had a court-appointed
    lawyer. Charges The charges against Mr. Babak K. were announced as "murder
    and harassment. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence
    provided against Mr. Babak K. was his confession to harassment and
    suffocation of the victim, recovery of the victim s body at the location
    pointed out by him, and testimonies of neighbors indicating that Mr. Babak
    K. was last seen with the victim on the night of the incident. Mr. Babak
    K. went to his brother s house on his niece s birthday on April 3, 2001,
    but his brother did not let him into his house. According to reports, he
    kidnapped the five-year-old girl to retaliate for his brother s actions.
    Among all sources, Jam-e Jam newspaper was the only source that reported
    the result of forensics examinations confirming his mental health.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense In his defense Mr. Babak K. referred to his
    suffering from epilepsy and his psychological problems and stated, I don t
    know why I committed such a crime. (Iran newspaper, April 8, 2001)
    Pointing out his desire to marry and his family s prevention, he stated: I
    was rejected everywhere. Most of the time, I took pills and was not in a
    normal condition. (Iran newspaper, July 5, 2001) Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Babak K. to death (two counts) for murder and harassment.
    The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was executed in Qasr Prison on
    November 14, 2001.
