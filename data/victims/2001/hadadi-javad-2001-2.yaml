    News of the execution of Mr. Javad Hadadi, along with two others, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on October 25, 2001. Additional
    information was taken from the Hamshahri and Ettela at newspapers on June
    6, 2000. His case was related to the murder of a young man near the Hemat
    Highway in Tehran in January of 1999. Arrest and detention Mr. Hadadi was
    identified and arrested in Qazvin following an investigation into the
    murder of a young man and confession of the victim s wife. The
    circumstances and date of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Branch 1603 of the Criminal Court in Tehran tried Mr. Hadadi. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Hadadi was announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence provided against Mr. Hadadi was his confession and the confession
    of the victim s wife. According to the Hamshahri newspaper report, Mr.
    Hadadi confessed that he had committed the crime because of his feeling
    for the victim s wife. During her interrogation, the victim s wife stated
    that she married her husband because of her family s wishes. Since she did
    not like her husband, she and Mr. Hadadi, who had been acquainted in a
    park some time earlier, planned to lure the victim to the Hemat Highway
    where Mr. Hadadi killed him with blows of a knife. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Hadadi s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Javad Hadadi to death and 99 lashes. The Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at the Qasr Prison yard in Tehran on
    October 24, 2001. The victim s wife, the second row defendant of this
    case, was condemned to 15 years imprisonment and 99 lashes for
    participation in murder.
