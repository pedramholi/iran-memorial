    News of the execution of Mr. Keyvan Najafi, along with two others, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on October 25, 2001. Additional
    information regarding his prosecution was published in the Hamshahri
    newspaper on June 11, 2000. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Najafi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 1608 of the
    Tehran Criminal Court tried Mr. Najafi. No information is available on his
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Najafi was announced as
    murder. According to the Hamshahri newspaper, on March 19, 2000, he and
    three of his friends got into a street fight with the victim and his
    friends during which Mr. Najafi stabbed the victim in the neck and killed
    him. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences, against their opponents (including political, civil society
    activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each
    year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence provided
    against Mr. Najafi was his confession. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Najafi s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Keyvan Najafi to death. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged at the Qasr Prison yard on October 24, 2001.
