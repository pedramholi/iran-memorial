    Arrest and Detention According to the media reports, on December 28, 2000,
    two armed robbers attacked a house in Suhanak, Shemiran, and shot to death
    two members of a family and injured three others. Security agents

    Mehdi and Rahi Ahmadi were arrested. According to the Ettela at newspaper

    According to the Ettela at newspaper published on January 13, 2001, Mr.
    Ahmadi and his brother, Mehdi, had attempted once before to rob the house
    but fled without success. They returned to the house on December 28, 2000
    in the evening and when the family members noticed their presence, they
    shot them resulting in the murder of two and injuries to three family
    members before escaping the scene. Evidence of Guilt According to the
