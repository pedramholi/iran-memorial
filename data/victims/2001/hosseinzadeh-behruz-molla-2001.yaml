    News of the execution of Mr. Behruz Molla Hosseinzadeh was published in
    the Iran newspaper on January 31, 2001. His case was related to the
    beating of the ex-governor of Kerman Province and murder of an individual.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Molla Hosseinzadeh was arrested while robbing the
    house of a relative of the ex-governor of Kerman in January of 1999. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Molla Hosseinzadeh s trial. Charges The
    charges brought against Mr. Molla Hosseinzadeh were announced as beating
    of the ex-governor of Kerman and murdering of a eulogist. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Molla Hosseinzadeh. Defense No information is available on Mr. Molla
    Hosseinzadeh s defense. Judgment A court condemned Mr. Behruz Molla
    Hosseinzadeh to death and he was hanged in 2001.
