circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Hossein Talkhabi, and another individual by the name
    of Abolfazl Dehqan, was reported in two November 2001 Amnesty
    International Urgent Actions. Additional information has been drawn from
    the Iran newspaper (September 16, 2001). According to the Iran newspaper,
    Mr. Talkhabi, also known as Hossein Rish, was the head of a 40-member
    crime ring, the members of which were accused of sex and drug related
    crimes. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Talkhabi’s arrest
    and detention are not known, other than the members of the abovementioned
    crime ring were arrested in July/August of 2001. Trial There is no
    information regarding this trial, other than Mr. Talkhabi was tried at
    Branch Seven of General Court of Qom (AI). Charges The specific charges
    brought against Mr. Talkhabi are not known. The members of the crime ring
    were collectively charged with “deluding young women, transporting
    narcotic drugs, rape, kidnapping, moral corruption, robbery, and battery”
    ( Iran ). The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Talkhabi’s defense. Judgment
    Mr. Hossein Talkhabi was condemned to death; the Supreme Court approved
    this sentence. On November 10, 2001, he and a co-defendant was flogged 150
    lashes and then hanged in public at Resalat Square in Qom.
