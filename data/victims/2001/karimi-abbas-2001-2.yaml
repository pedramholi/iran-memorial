    News of the execution of Mr. Abbas Karimi was announced by the office of
    the Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan. Additional information was taken
    from the ABF interview with a member of this organization in Saqez and the
    Komala Office in Erbil, Iraq. Mr. Karimi, known as Helu, 22, was single
    and from Saqez in Kurdistan. He had a middle school education. In 1995, he
    joined the Komala Party in Kurdistan and served for a year in Saqez and
    the surrounding area. One year later, he became a Peshmerga and was active
    in the Showan Battalion for five years. His responsibilities in Komala
    included being a Group Deputy, working in the technical department of the
    organization radio, being a Group Commander, and being in charge of the
    library. In the mid 1960 s, several remaining members of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party of Iran established the Revolutionary Organization of
    this party in Iraq. Among its leaders were Esma il Sharifzadeh, Abdollah
    Mo ini, and Mola avareh, who began an armed guerrilla struggle in
    Kurdistan inspired by the Cuban Revolution. The group was defeated in 1969
    and several of its members arrested. The Revolutionary Organization of
    Working People in Kurdistan (Komala) was established upon the release of a
    number of the leaders in 1978. After the revolution, in accordance with
    Marxist theory, Komala opposed capitalists and landlords, and encouraged
    workers and peasants in Kurdistan, in particular in the city of Sanandaj
    and vicinity where they had strong support, to initiate an armed uprising
    against capitalists, landlords and the central government. In 1982, Komala
    joined another Marxist group, Sahand, an organization concentrating mainly
    on theory and ideology, and established the Communist Party of Iran.
    Komala subsequently adopted the name The Kurdistan Organization of the
    Communist Party of Iran, Komala. By the mid-1980s, the central government
    had succeeded in pushing Komala fighters out of Kurdistan and into
    Northern Iraq. Years later, Komala split from the Communist Party of Iran
    and faced several schisms, each continuing to use the name Komala. Arrest
