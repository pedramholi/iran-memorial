    News of the execution of Mr. Labakhsh Bameri, son of Rasulbakhsh and known
    as Dakali, along with another person, was published in the Ettela at
    newspaper on October 29, 2001, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Iranshahr. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Bameri s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Iranshahr tried Mr.
    Bameri. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Bameri were announced as sedition, road-blocking,
    armed robbery, and creating public insecurity in the area. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Bameri. Defense No information is available on Mr. Bameri s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Labakhsh Bameri to death and the Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public in Iranshahr in
    November of 2001. No specific date of execution is reported.
