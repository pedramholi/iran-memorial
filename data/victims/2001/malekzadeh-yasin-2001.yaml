    News of the execution of Mr. Yasin Malekzadeh, son of Haj Gholam, along
    with another person, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on December 17,
    2001. Arrest and detention According to the report, after committing the
    crime on November 25, 2001, Mr. Malekzadeh and his collaborator escaped
    the scene; however, he was identified and arrested by police a few hours
    later. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    The Public Court of Saravan tried Mr. Malekzadeh. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Malekzadeh
    was announced as rape. According to the report, Mr. Malekzadeh and his
    collaborator, covering their faces, climbed up a wall and entered a house
    belonging to a high school teacher in Jalaq District. Then they threatened
    the teacher s wife with a knife, tied her Chador [veil] around her neck,
    and raped her. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Malekzadeh. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Malekzadeh s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Yasin
    Malekzadeh to death and 20 lashes. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling.
    He was hanged in public at the entrance square in Jalaq in December of
    2001. The exact date of this execution is unknown.
