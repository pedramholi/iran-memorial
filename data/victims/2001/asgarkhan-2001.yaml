    News of the execution of Mr. Asgarkhan, an Afghan citizen, was published
    in the Ettela at newspaper on March 8, 2001. Additional information was
    taken from the Ettela at newspaper on December 19, 2000. According to this
    report, security forces clashed with several Afghan citizens in Kashmar
    resulted in the killing of two, and the injuring and escape of three of
    them, without mentioning their names. Arrest and detention According to
    the report, after Mr. Asgarkhan was injured, he took refuge in the house
    of a resident in Kashmar until he was identified and arrested by
    authorities. Trial No information is available on Mr. Asgarkhan s trial.
    Charges According to the Ettela at newspaper, quoting the Commander of
    Security Forces in Kashmar, the charges brought against Mr. Asgarkhan were
    announced as having a record for sedition and armed drug trafficking, and
    activities in the southern elevations of Kashmar. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Asgarkhan.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Asgarkhan s defense. Judgment
    Mr. Asgarkhan was hanged in public at the Chelio Village near Kuhsorkh in
    Kashmar on March 7, 2001. No specific information is available about this
    execution.
