    News of the execution of Mr. Mehrdad Yusefi, son of Shamsollah, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on May 30, 2001, quoting the
    Head of Ilam Province Courthouse. Amnesty International also reported this
    execution among the executions of minors in October of 2002. According to
    this report, Mr. Yusefi was under 18 when he committed the crime.
    According to the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper report, Mr. Yusefi was 16 years
    old at the time of committing the crime but was 18 when executed.

    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention
    on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and

    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Yusefi. Defense
