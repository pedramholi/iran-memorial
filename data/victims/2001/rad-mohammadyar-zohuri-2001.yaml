    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammadyar Zohuri Rad, along with another
    person, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami and Iran newspapers on October
    30, 2001. Additional information was taken from the Ettela at newspaper on
    July 15, 2001. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Zohuri Rad s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Shiraz tried Mr. Zohuri Rad. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges According to the Ettela at newspaper, quoting the Head of Fars
    Provincial Courthouse, the charges brought against Mr. Zohuri Rad and 27
    others were collectively announced as fighting against God by
    participation in armed robberies, possession of combat weapons and illegal
    ammunition, and dealing narcotics in large volume. According to the Head
    of Fars Provincial Courthouse, these individuals participated in a clash
    with security forces in Fars in the fall of 2000. They had a major role in
    several armed robberies and creating public fear and intimidation. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the Ettela
    at newspaper, quoting the Head of Fars Provincial Courthouse, the evidence
    presented against Mr. Zohuri Rad and other defendants was testimony by 47
    plaintiffs and recovery of the stolen properties. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Zohuri Rad s defense. Judgment The court identified
    Mr. Mohammadyar Zohuri Rad as Mohareb (fighter against God) and condemned
    him to death and 6 years imprisonment with hard labor. The Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public at the Kazerun Gate in
    Shiraz on October 29, 2001.
