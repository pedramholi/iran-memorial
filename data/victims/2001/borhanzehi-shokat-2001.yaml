    News of the execution of Mr. Shokat Borhanzehi, son of Morad, along with
    another person, was published in the Ettela at newspaper on October 29,
    2001, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Iranshahr. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Borhanzehi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch One of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Iranshahr tried Mr. Borhanzehi. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against
    Mr. Borhanzehi were announced as sedition, road-blocking, armed robbery,
    and creating insecurity in the area. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Borhanzehi. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Borhanzehi s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Shokat Borhanzehi to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He
    was hanged in public in Iranshahr in October of 2001. The exact date of
    this execution is unknown.
