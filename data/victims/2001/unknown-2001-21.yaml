    News of the execution of an unknown person, along with four others, was
    published in the Kayhan newspaper on August 4, 2001. Arrest and detention
    According to the report, security forces attacked the base of defendants
    near Naharkhoran forest and arrested several of them. The circumstances of
    the defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges brought against
    the defendant were collectively announced as participation in kidnapping
    and rape. According to the report, defendants, in groups as large as 30
    individuals, ambushed people on the road to the Naharkhoran Forest Park.
    They robbed travelers, tied men to trees, and raped women in front of men.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against the
    defendant was his confession. According to the report, the arrested
    defendants confessed to tens of robberies and rapes. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment The
    defendant was hanged, along with four others, in public in Naharkhoran,
    Gorgan, on August 1, 2001. No specific information is available about the
    defendant s execution.
