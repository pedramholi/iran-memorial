    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Akbar Reza'i, along with four others, was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami and Ettela at newspapers on April 18,
    2001. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Reza i s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Birjand
    tried Mr. Reza i. No information is available on his trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Reza i was announced as transporting 103
    kilograms of heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Reza i. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Reza i s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Ali Akbar Reza'i to death and the Supreme Court confirmed
    the ruling. He was hanged in Birjand on April 16, 2001.
