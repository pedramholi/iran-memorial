    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Sa'adatkhah was published in the Kayhan
    newspaper on April 30, 2001 and in the Iran newspaper on May 20, 2001.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Sa'adatkhah s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch Seven of the Dezful Court tried Mr.
    Sa'adatkhah. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Sa'adatkhah were announced as murder and robbery.
    According to the media reports, he had murdered a woman and stolen her
    belongings when he tried to rob the house of his relative on October 4,
    1999. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Sa'adatkhah
    was his confession. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Sa'adatkhah s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ali
    Sa'adatkhah to death. He was hanged in public in Dezful on April 30, 2001.
