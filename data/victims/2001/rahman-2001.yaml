    Information regarding the execution of Mr. Rahman was published in the
    Iran newspaper on May 19, 2005. According to this report, he confessed
    that he had a relationship with the wife of an imprisoned prayer writer.
    After awhile, she told him that a man named Hossein harassed her and asked
    Mr. Rahman to end the harassment. He planned to befriend the victim and
    while they were in his car, he stabbed him in the neck and his brother
    also stabbed the victim in the side. The two brothers then left the body
    in the wilderness and burned the car. Arrest and detention According to
    the report, on October 2, 1998, a man went to the police station at
    Baghestan and reported the missing of his brother, Hossein. The next day,
    the burned car of the missing man was found in Sarvabad and his body was
    recovered at Palangabad in Eshtahard later in the evening. Police tracked
    the victim s phone and identified Raman, 23, and his brother, 17. They
    were able to seek and arrest Mr. Rahman. Trial Branch 116 of the Criminal
    Court of Karaj tried Mr. Rahman. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges The charges brought against Mr. Rahman were announced as murder,
    adultery, and robbery. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Rahman was his confession and the confession of his brother
    and the woman with whom he had the relationship. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Rahman s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Rahman to death for murder, 30 lashes and paying the value
    of the car to the victim s family for robbery and burning the car, and to
    another 100 lashes for adultery. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling.
    He was hanged in Karaj on September 17, 2001.
