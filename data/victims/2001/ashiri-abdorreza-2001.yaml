    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on his defense. Judgment No information is available on the
    details of this judgment. According to the newspaper report, Branch 1601
    of Tehran Criminal Court Complex condemned Mr. Ali Asghar Ana’i, and he
