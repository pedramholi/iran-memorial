circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Kahim Rakhshani, son of Najib from
    Afghanistan, was published on the website of the Kayhan newspaper (June
    19, 2001) and Jomhuri Eslami newspaper (June 18, 2001). Arrest and
    Detention Zabol security forces arrested Mr. Rakhshani. There is no deails
    available on his arrest and detention. Trial Branch Four of Zabol General
    Court tried Mr. Rakhshani. Details of his trial is not available. Charges
    Mr. Rakhshani was charged with illegal entry, armed robbery, kidnapping,
    disrupting public order, and rape. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available about
    the defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Kahim Rakhshani to death for
    rape. He was also condemned to imprisonment for other charges. The ruling
    was confirmed by the Supreme Court and he was beheaded in public at
    Shahrbani intersection in Zabol (Sistan and Baluchestan province) on June
    16, 2001.
