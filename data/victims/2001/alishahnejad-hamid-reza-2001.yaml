    The news of the execution of Mr. Hamid Reza Alishahnejad and seven other
    individuals was published in the web edition of the Iran newspaper on July
    19, 2001. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are unknown. Trial The newspaper report provides no
    specific information on the defendant’s trial, which took place sometime
    between September 26, 2000 (when the alleged crime took place), and the
    execution day. There is no information available on whether or not there
    was an appeal process or a Supreme Court decision. Charges According to
    the newspaper report, Mr. Alishahnejad was charged with “the first degree
    muder Kiumars lafi on September 26, 2000.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Shahnejad's defense. Judgment No information is available
    on the details of this judgment. According to the newspaper report, Branch
    1601 of theTehran Criminal Court condemned Mr. Shahnejad to death and he
    was hanged on July 18, 2001 at dawn.
