    News of the execution of Mr. Mazar Joshanzehi, son of Nurshah and a
    citizen of Pakistan, along with two others, was published in the Kayhan
    newspaper on July 9, 2001. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Joshanzehi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Birjand tried Mr. Joshanzehi. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Joshanzehi
    was announced as drug trafficking. According to the report, he and his
    collaborators participated in transportation and distribution of over 4
    tons of narcotics and in the killing of several security agents. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Joshanzehi. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Joshanzehi s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Birjand condemned Mr. Mazar Joshanzehi to death based on the referential
    ruling number 80. He was hanged in public in Zahedan in July of 2001. The
    exact date of this execution is unknown
