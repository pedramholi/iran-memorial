    News of the execution of Mr. Ebrahim Tale i, along with three others, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on June 21, 2001. Additional information
    regarding his arrest and prosecution was taken from the Resalat newspaper
    on July 24, 1999, the Hamshahri newspaper on July 25, 1999 and February 5,
    2000, the Ettela at newspaper on June 29 and 30, July 10, and December 29,
    1999. Mr. Tale i, son of Mohammad, was single and a resident of Tehran.
    The Ettela at newspaper on June 29, 1999 wrote his name as Ebrahim Nader.
    Arrest and detention According to the media reports, after a woman and her
    two children were murdered at their house on June 8, 1999, police
    suspected Ebrahim, the son of the partner of the victim s family, who did
    not go home after the incident. Police followed the clues, identified, and
    arrested him in Mashhad after 18 days. Then, four other defendants who
    were his collaborators were also arrested. The circumstances of Mr. Tale i
    s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 1602 of the Public
    Court of Tehran tried Mr. Tale i. According to the Resalat newspaper,
    first, the judge described the crime and the victim s family demanded
    maximum penalty for Mr. Tale i. Then defendants answered the judge s
    questions. After the ruling was issued against Mr. Tale i, his attorney
    appealed the ruling based on the illness of his client. The Supreme Court
    nullified the ruling and asked the court that forensics check the
    defendant again. According to the Ettela at newspaper on December 29,
    1999, the forensics report indicated that he was completely healthy.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Tale i was announced as three
    counts premeditated murder with blows of a knife and an iron bar.
    According to the media reports, he and his collaborators had planned to
    enter a house, then murdered a mother and her two children, and escaped.
    His father was a partner with the victim s husband and had cancelled their
    partnership two years earlier. Reports indicated that Mr. Tale i s
    intention was to rob gold and jewelry from his father s ex-partner using
    his acquaintance with the victims. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Tale i was his confession and the confession of his
    collaborators. According to the Resalat newspaper, he accepted the charge
    of committing three counts of murder motivated by robbery and escaping the
    country. According to the Hamshahri newspaper, the victim s sister had
    seen Mr. Tale i on the staircase and seen how he left the yard quickly.
    Regarding the defendant s motive to murder, the Ettela at newspaper quoted
    the judge stating: Ebrahim planned to rob and murder. If he had chosen the
    house of an unknown family, we could consider the motive as robbery
    resulting in murder. He had confessed that he took the iron bar from his
    father s shop and a slaughter knife to murder members of this family.
    Regarding a rumor that he had committed the crime to get money for
    treating his cancer, the judge stated: There is no indication of his
    illness in the case and if he was ill, this does not justify his
    responsibility and he did not commit the murder based on temporary
    insanity. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense According to the Resalat
    newspaper, Mr. Tale i s public defender stated his motive as robbery and
    leaving the country for economic and cultural poverty, and listed revenge,
    hatred, blame, anger, and a previous dispute as contributing factors to
    the crime. Mr. Tale i claimed insanity as his defense; however, during the
    trial stated: I have no defense and cannot say anything. In response to
    the Resalat newspaper reporter who asked the reason for the incident, he
    said: I was fooled by my comradeship. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Ebrahim Tale i to death (three counts). The Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged at the Qasr Prison yard in Tehran on June 20, 2001.
