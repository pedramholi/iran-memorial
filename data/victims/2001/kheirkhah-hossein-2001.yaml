    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Kheirkhah, along with five others,
    was published in the Iran newspaper on January 18, 2001. Additional
    information was taken from the Iran newspaper on January 17, 2001 and the
    Ettela at newspaper on July 24, 1999. His case and the cases of two others
    were related to the kidnapping and murders of an antique seller and a
    businessman in Tehran in 1997. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    Mr. Kheirkhah s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 1602 of
    the Criminal Court in Tehran tried Mr. Kheirkhah and the two other
    defendants. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Kheirkhah and another defendant were announced as
    kidnapping two individuals and murdering them. According to the existing
    information, three defendants, wearing the Gas Company uniforms, climbed a
    wall and entered a victim s house. When the owner (an antique seller)
    entered his home, they tied his hands and feet and suffocated him with a
    rope. Then they buried the body in the yard. On another occasion, these
    defendants, pretending to be an agent on the Azadegan Freeway, stopped an
    individual and took him to a warehouse in Shahr-e Ray, and stole his cash,
    traveler s checks, and some documents from his safe. Then, they fed the
    victim some sleeping pills and murdered him while he was asleep. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Kheirkhah was his
    confession and the confession of his collaborator. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Kheirkhah s defense. Judgment The
    Criminal Court in Tehran condemned Mr. Hossein Kheirkhah to death and the
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along with five others,
    in Qasr Prison in Tehran on January 17, 2001.
