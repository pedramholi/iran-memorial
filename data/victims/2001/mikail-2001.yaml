    News of the execution of Mr. Mika il was published on the website of
    Nimruz on August 10, 2001. This case was related to kidnapping, rape, and
    attempted murder of a young woman. According to the report, Mr. Mika il
    was a fortune-teller who deceived women and young girls and took them to
    his house. Arrest and detention According to the report, Mr. Mika il was
    identified and arrested by police in 1997. His arrest was related to the
    kidnapping of a girl college student for three months and the recovery of
    her half-dead body in a ditch around Eslamshahr on July 6, 1997. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Public
    Court of Tehran tried Mr. Mika il out of order. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Mika il
    were announced as deceiving, imprisoning, harassing, and torturing young
    women. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences, against their opponents (including political, civil society
    activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each
    year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Mika il was his confession, the confession of his wife, and
    the testimony of the victim. During his confession, he stated that he
    acted as a fortune-teller, befriended women who went to the shrine, and
    took them to his house. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Mika il s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mika il to death
    and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was executed at the Evin
    Prison yard in Tehran on August 1, 2001.
