    News of the execution of Mr. Ebrahim Safavi was published in the Ettela at
    newspaper on November 7, 2001. This case was related to the murder of a
    jewelry store owner. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Safavi
    s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 35 of the Public Court
    of Shiraz tried Mr. Safavi. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges The charges brought against Mr. Safavi were announced as
    attempting an armed robbery, two counts robberies, drinking alcoholic
    beverages, and murder. According to the report, Mr. Safavi entered a
    jewelry store for robbery in November of 2000 when he faced the owner s
    resistance and shot and killed him. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Safavi. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Safavi s defense. Judgment The court condemned Ebrahim Safavi to
    death and the Supreme Judicial Council confirmed the ruling. He was hanged
    at the location of the committed crime on November 6, 2001.
