    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Reza M., along with two others, was
    published in the Iran and Ettela at newspapers on October 23, 2001.
    Additional information was taken from the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    August 23, 1999. His case was related to the kidnapping and murder of
    several women in Tehran. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Ali
    Reza M. s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 1413 of the
    Special Court for State Employees tried Mr. Ali Reza M.. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Ali Reza M. and
    his collaborators were collectively announced as rape, kidnapping,
    carjacking of a vehicle belonging to the Evin Prison, interfering with
    policing, and illegitimate relationships. According to the Public
    Relations Office of Tehran Provincial Courthouse, Mr. Ali Reza M. and his
    seven collaborators stole a police radio device and a vehicle belonging to
    the Prisons Organization and installed a rotating light and a forged
    license plate, and pretended to be police and Basiji agents, stopping cars
    for extortion with assault and battery in some cases. Mr. Ali Reza M. was
    also charged that he and two other defendants had kidnapped several young
    girls and women, taken them to predetermined locations, and raped them.
    (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper) The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence provided against Mr. Ali Reza M. included a police radio device
    and a vehicle belonging to the Prisons Organization with and installed
    rotating light and a forged license plate. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ali Reza M. s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Ali Reza M. to death for rape, to 15 years imprisonment for kidnapping, to
    one year imprisonment and 40 lashes for carjacking of a vehicle belonging
    to the Evin Prison, to six months imprisonment for interfering with
    policing, and to 100 lashes for illegitimate relationships. The Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at the Evin Prison yard on
    October 22, 2001.
