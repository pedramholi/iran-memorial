    Amid the judicial caprice of the times, Ms. Ayubi s painful death earned
    the consideration and dismay of human rights defenders the world around.
    The news of Ms. Maryan Ayubi s death by stoning was reported in an Amnesty
    International urgent action dated July 11, 2001. Amnesty International is
    outraged to learn that Maryam Ayoubi was stoned to death in Evin prison
    this morning. This is the second stoning to have taken place in Iran in
    the past two months. Ayubi s case was the subject of previous Amnesty
    International urgent actions dated January 16 and 18, 2001. Amnesty also
    quoted a January 18 article in the Tehran Times newspaper concerning the
    urgent action on Ms. Ayubi: It [the article] stated that The West
    intentionally wants to interfere in the internal matters of Iran, leveling
    baseless charges. It also said: Such a move by Amnesty is nothing but open
    interference in Iran s internal affairs . The execution was also announced
    by the Nimrooz weekly paper on July 20, 2001, referring to the news story
    of the Entekhab newspaper. Arrest and detention The exact circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial other than other than she was tried
    at Branch 1602 of the Criminal Court. The proceedings occurred on several
    court sessions. Charges Nimrooz quoted Entekhab newspaper and stated that
    on December 3, 2000, Ms. Ayubi, invited the man she loved to her house and
    they murdered her husband, Seyed Ziaoddin Tabataba i. Afterwards, she and
    her co-defendant transferred the body to the deserts near Varamin (Tehran
    province) and set it on fire. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. However, considering Article 103 of the Penal Code,
    and the fact that AI stated that in case she managed to dig herself out of
    the ditch she would not have been stoned, it appears that the evidence was
    not based on testimony of witnesses. Defense No information is available
    on Ms. Ayubi s defense. Judgment According to Nimrooz , the court
    condemned her co-defendant to death on the charge of murder and Ms. Maryam
    Ayubi was condemned to stoning on the charge of adultery. According to the
    AI report, she had been sentenced to 15 years imprisonment followed by
    stoning to death but subsequent news reports indicated that she was to be
    stoned. After performing the religious ceremonies, she was taken to the
    execution site inside Evin prison with a stretcher, and at the presence of
    the religion judge, was stoned to death on July 11, 2001. Before Ms. Ayubi
    s execution, Amnesty international had stressed that: stoning to death is
    prescribed for certain offences, primarily adultery, under the Iranian
    Penal Code. According to the Penal Code, men should be buried in a pit in
    the ground up to their waists, and women buried up to their chests.
    Individuals who manage to dig themselves out and escape from the pit
    whilst the stoning is being carried out have their lives spared. Article
    104 of the Penal Code states that: ...stones should not be too large so
    that the person dies on being hit by one or two of them... and [this
    punishment] is designed to cause grievous pain leading to eventual death.
    In the unlikely event that she manages to dig herself free before she is
    killed by the stones, Mrs. Ayubi will then start her fifteen-year
    sentence.
