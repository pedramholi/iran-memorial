    News of the execution of Mr. Hamid Heidari, known as Shirzad, was
    published on the website of ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on January
    10, 2001, and in the Jomhuri Eslami and Ettela at newspapers on January
    11, 2001. Additional information was taken from the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper on July 1, 2000 and the Ettela at newspaper on July18 and
    September 9, 2000. This case was related to the murder of a Basij member
    in 2000. Arrest and detention According to the Ettela at newspaper on
    July18, 2000, all defendants charged with the killing of a Basiji in
    Shahr-e Ray were arrested. According to the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, Mr.
    Heidari was arrested and transferred to the Qasr Prison. However, because
    of his fighting and arguing, he was transferred to the Qezelhesar Prison.
    Trial Branch Twelve of the Public Court of Shahr-e Ray tried Mr. Heidari.
    According to the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, quoting the Head of the Shahr-e
    Ray Courthouse, the trial took place in an open session in the presence of
    the victim s family and the defendant s attorney. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Heidari were announced as murder and drinking
    alcoholic beverages. According to the Ettela at newspaper, quoting the
    Public Relations Office of the Tehran Courthouse, In June of 2000, a fight
    broke out between the defendant and five others on one side, and a group
    of Basiji members from the base in Shahr-e Ray, who had performed
    inspection and promoted virtue and prevented vice, on the other side,
    which resulted in the killing of a Basij member from the base. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Heidari. Defense No information is available on Mr. Heidari s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hamid Heidari to death and 80 lashes. The
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public at the
    Ebnebabuyeh Quarter in Shahr-e Ray on January 10, 2001. According to the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, quoting the Head of the Shahr-e Ray Courthouse,
    Several institutions including so called human rights organizations had
    sent recommendations to some authorities in order to stop this execution;
    however, the Head of Judiciary personally observed and investigated the
    case and confirmed the ruling being carried out on the specific day.
