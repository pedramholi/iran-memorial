    News of the execution of Ms. Parvin Mirza i was published in the Kayhan
    newspaper on July 11, 2001. According to this report, in collaboration
    with a man, she premeditatedly burned an old woman in her house and
    escaped the scene. Arrest and detention According to the report, Ms. Mirza
    i was arrested during a robbery from a jewelry store in Hamadan province
    in 1998. She was transferred to the Kuhdasht Courthouse. Trial No
    information is available on Ms. Mirza i s trial. Charges The charges
    brought against Ms. Mirza i were announced as murder and burning the
    victim s body, robbery, using a forged document, and having an
    illegitimate relationship. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Ms. Mirza i was her confession. International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Mirza i s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Ms. Parvin Mirza i to death. She was hanged in Kuhdasht,
    Lorestan, in July of 2001. The exact date of this execution is unknown
