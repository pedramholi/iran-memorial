    News of the execution of Mr. Dariush Keshavarzi, son of Hossein, along
    with another person, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on March 1,
    2001. His case and the case of the other defendant were related to the
    killing of three agents during a clash and chase in 1999. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Keshavarzi s arrest and detention are
    not known. According to the report, there had been a clash and chase with
    officials on January 7, 1999, but it s not known whether he was arrested
    on that day or later. Trial No information is available on Mr. Keshavarzi
    s trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Keshavarzi were announced
    as committing a murder, participation in armed transportation of over 900
    kilograms of opium, participation in carrying three Kalashnikovs
    illegally, dealing and addiction to narcotics, and assistance in smuggling
    1,400 kilograms of opium. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Keshavarzi. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Keshavarzi s defense. Judgment Mr. Dariush
    Keshavarzi was condemned to death, lashes, confiscation of property, and
    paying a fine. He was hanged, along with another person, in public at a
    square in Abadeh, Fars, on February 29, 2001.
