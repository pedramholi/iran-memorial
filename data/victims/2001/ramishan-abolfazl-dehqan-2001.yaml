    News of the execution of Mr. Abolfazl Dehqan Ramishan, son of Bayram ali,
    along with another person, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper
    on November 11, 2001, and in a statement by Amnesty International on
    November 12, 2001. Additional information was taken from the Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper and Amnesty International on November 8, 2001, the Iran
    newspaper on September 16, 2001, and the Ettela at newspaper on September
    15, 2001. His case and the cases of 39 others were related to sexual and
    narcotics crimes. After the judge of this case reported that two men would
    be executed and five others would be lashed in public, Amnesty
    International issued a statement supporting the defendants on November 8,
    2001. Arrest and detention Mr. Dehqan Ramishan was arrested, along with 39
    other members of a gang in the Markazi province, by Basij forces in Qom in
    August of 2001 (Iran and Ettela at newspapers). According to the judge of
    this case, some of the defendants remained on the run (Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper). The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Special Branch Seven of the Public Court of Qom tried Mr. Dehqan
    Ramishan and the other defendants. This case was processed out of turn. No
    information is available on his trial. (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper) Charges
    According to the judge of the Special Branch Seven of the Public Court of
    Qom, the charges against Mr. Dehqan Ramishan and another person were
    kidnapping, rape, establishment of a corruption center in a residence,
    adultery with an unmarried person, threatening with knife and dagger,
    carrying and possessing and drinking alcoholic beverages, carrying and
    possession of narcotics, and deceiving under-aged girls. (Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper) The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence
    presented against Mr. Dehqan Ramishan was thirteen plaintiffs of this
    case. Defense No information is available on Mr. Dehqan Ramishan s
    defense. Judgment The Special Branch Seven of the Public Court of Qom
    condemned Mr. Abolfazl Dehqan Ramishan to death, 10 years imprisonment,
    and 150 lashes. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. After receiving
    150 lashes, he was hanged, along with another person, in public at Resalat
    Square in Qom on November 10, 2001. Twenty-one other defendants were also
    condemned to imprisonment, exile, and lashes and the rulings against seven
    of them were confirmed by the Supreme Court.
