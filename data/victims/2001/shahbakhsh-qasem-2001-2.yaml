    News of the execution of Mr. Qasem Shahbakhsh, from Zahedan, along with
    two others, was published in the Kayhan newspaper on July 9, 2001. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of Mr. Shahbakhsh s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Birjand tried Mr.
    Shahbakhsh. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Shahbakhsh was announced as drug trafficking.
    According to the report, he and his collaborators participated in
    transportation and distribution of over 4 tons of narcotics and in the
    killing of several security agents. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Shahbakhsh. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Shahbakhsh s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Birjand condemned Mr. Qasem Shahbakhsh to death
    based on the referential ruling number 80. He was hanged in public in
    Zahedan in July of 2001. The exact date of this execution is unknown.
