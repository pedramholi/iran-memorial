    News of the execution of Mr. Abdolhamid Barahu i, along with two others,
    was published in the Kayhan newspaper on February 25, 2001. He was from
    Zahedan and his case and the cases of two others were related to drug
    trafficking and connection with Afghan smugglers in Sistan-va-Baluchestan.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Barahu i s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch Nine of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court in Mashhad tried Mr. Barahu i and two other defendants. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges According to the Public
    Relations Office of the Political and Ideological Department of the
    Security Forces in Chenaran, the charges brought against Mr. Barahu i and
    two other defendants were collectively announced as supply, distribution,
    and dealing narcotics; hiding and possession of a weapon; and connection
    with armed Afghan hoodlums. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Barahu i was possession of 3,070
    kilograms of opium, over 400 kilograms of morphine, and possession of five
    Kalashnikovs and 14 magazines. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Barahu i s defense. Judgment Branch Nine of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court in Mashhad condemned Mr. Abdolhamid Barahu i to death and the
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along with two others,
    in public in Chenaran. No information is available about the date of this
    execution.
