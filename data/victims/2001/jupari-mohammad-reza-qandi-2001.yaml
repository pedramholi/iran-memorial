    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Qandi Jupari, son of Mahmud,
    known as Haji, along with another person, was published in the Kayhan
    newspaper on March 1, 2001. His case and the case of the other defendant
    were related to the killing of three agents during a clash and chase in
    1999. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Qandi Jupari s arrest
    and detention are not known. According to the report, there had been a
    clash and chase with officials on January 7, 1999, but it s not known
    whether he was arrested on that day or later. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Qandi Jupari s trial. Charges The charges brought against
    Mr. Qandi Jupari were announced as committing a murder, participation in
    armed transportation of over 900 kilograms of opium, participation in
    carrying three Kalashnikovs illegally, dealing and addiction to narcotics,
    and assistance in smuggling 1,400 kilograms of opium. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Qandi
    Jupari. Defense No information is available on Mr. Qandi Jupari s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Mohammad Reza Qandi Jupari was condemned to death, lashes,
    confiscation of property, and paying a fine. He was hanged, along with
    another person, in public at a square in Abadeh, Fars, on February 29,
    2001.
