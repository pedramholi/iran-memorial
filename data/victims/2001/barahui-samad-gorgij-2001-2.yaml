    News of the execution of Mr. Samad Gorgij (Barahu i), along with four
    others, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami and Ettela at newspapers on
    April 18, 2001. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Gorgij
    (Barahu i) s arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Birjand tried Mr. Gorgij (Barahu i). No information
    is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Gorgij
    (Barahu i) were announced as armed participation in importing 4 tons of
    opium from Pakistan and Afghanistan into Iran, possession of a weapon, and
    participation in an international gang supplying and distributing
    narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Gorgij (Barahu i). Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Gorgij (Barahu i) s defense. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Samad Gorgij (Barahui)to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in Birjand on April 16, 2001.
