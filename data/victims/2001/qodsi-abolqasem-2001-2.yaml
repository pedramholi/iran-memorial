circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Abolqasem Qodsi was published in the Iran
    newspaper on March 1, 2001. He was a physician residing in Gorgan. His
    case was related to the murder of three individuals in his villa at
    Alangdareh Park in Gorgan on July 30, 2000. Arrest and detention Mr. Qodsi
    was arrested by police inspectors a day after the incident on July 31,
    2000. He was detained for seven months. The circumstances of his arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial Branch Two of the Public Court in
    Gorgan tried Mr. Qodsi. No information is available on his trial. Charges
    The charges brought against Mr. Qodsi were announced as three counts
    murder. According to the report, he had invited his wife, aged 18, his
    mother-in-law, 40, and his brother-in-law, 14, to his villa separately.
    Then he anesthetized them, and cut their wrist veins. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Qodsi was his confession. During his
    primary interrogation, he claimed that his suspicion of his wife caused
    the incident; however, during the specialized police interrogation, he
    retracted his previous claim and stated that because of intense family
    disputes, he decided to take revenge. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Qodsi s
    attorney objected to the harsh ruling and demanded that the Supreme Court
    investigate the case. No further information is available on his defense.
    Judgment Branch Two of the Public Court in Gorgan condemned Mr. Abolqasem
    Qodsi to death (three counts). Branch 32 of the Supreme Court confirmed
    the ruling. He was hanged by a crane in public at the 30-Meter Street near
    Emamzadeh Abdollah in Gorgan on February 26, 2001.
