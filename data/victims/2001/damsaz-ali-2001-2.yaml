    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Damsaz, 19, was published in the Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper on January 27, 2001. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Damsaz s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Damsaz s trial. Charges The charge brought
    against Mr. Damsaz was announced as murder. He was accused of murdering an
    eight-year-old boy from the Motorich Village near Mahmudabad in October of
    2000. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences, against their opponents (including political, civil society
    activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each
    year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Damsaz. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Damsaz s defense. Judgment A court condemned Mr. Ali Damsaz to death. He
    was executed in Mahmudabad, Mazandaran, on January 25, 2001. No specific
    information is available about this execution.
