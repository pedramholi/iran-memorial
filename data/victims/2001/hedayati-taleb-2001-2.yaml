    The execution of Mr. Taleb Hedayati along with seven other individuals was
    published on the web edition of the Iran newspaper on July 19, 2001.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial The newspaper report provides no specific
    information on the defendant’s trial, which took place sometime between
    April 16, 2000 (when the alleged crime took place), and the execution day.
    Whether there was an appeal process or a Supreme Court decision is not
    known. Charges The charge against Mr. Taleb Hedayati was announced as
    “murdering Hushang Alipur on April 16, 2000.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Taleb Hedayati’s defense. Judgment No information is
    available on the details of this judgment. According to the newspaper
    report, Branch 1601 of Tehran Criminal Court Complex condemned Mr. Taleb
    Hedayati to death and he was hanged at dawn on July 18, 2001.
