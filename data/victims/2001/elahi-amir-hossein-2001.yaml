    News of the execution of Mr. Amir Hossein Elahi, along with three others,
    was published in the Iran newspaper on June 21, 2001. Additional
    information was taken from the Iran newspaper on June 20, 2001. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Elahi s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Elahi s trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Elahi was announced as murder. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Elahi.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Elahi s defense. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Amir Hossein Elahi to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at the Qasr Prison yard on June 20,
    2001.
