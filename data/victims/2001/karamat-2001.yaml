    News of the execution of Mr. Karamat was published in the Kayhan newspaper
    on July 9, 2001. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Karamat s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Karamat s trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Karamat were
    announced as murder and robbery. According to the report, in collaboration
    with another person, he had murdered a driver by blows of a knife and
    stolen his vehicle on the road from Neyriz to Sirjan. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Karamat. Defense No information is available on Mr. Karamat s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Karamat was hanged at Darolrahmeh in Neyriz, Fars, in July of
    2001. The exact date of this execution is unknown. No specific information
    is available about this execution.
