circumstances: >
    Mr. Mansour Afzaly is among the 64 individuals listed in the United
    Nations Interim Report (11 October 1996) on the Situation of Human Rights
    in the Islamic Republic of Iran prepared by the Special Representative of
    the Commission, Mr. Maurice Danby Copithorne. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The circumstances of the trial remain unknown. Charges The charges
    brought against this defendant were not specified in the UN report. He and
    6 others, however, were reported to have been collectively charged with
    “armed robbery, kidnapping and smuggling.” Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the
    defense. Judgment Mr. Afzaly was sentenced to death and subsequently
    executed.
