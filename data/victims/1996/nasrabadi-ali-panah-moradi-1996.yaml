    Force groups in Turkey (June/July/August 2000), the verdict issued by the

    Iran Efshagar (February 20, 2020) and the annual report of Amnesty
    International (2000). Additional information about this case has been
    obtained from the website Be-Suye Piruzi (July 26, 2016, the Turkish
    newspaper Cumhuriyet (May 24 and August 1, 1996, January 25, 1997, April
    21, 2000, June 5, 1998), the Turkish newspaper Milliyet (May 8, 2000) and
    other sources* Mr. Moradi Nasrabadi was born in Tehran in 1965. He was
    married, a karate instructor, and a resident of T rkiye. He was a member
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, which was active in organizing and
    advocating for the rights of Iranian refugees in Turkey. (Electronic form
    sent to ABC, January 27, 2017) The Mojahedin Khalq Organization The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization(MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adopted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in an
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive economic and social analysis method but considered Islam their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975 following
    a profound ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology, and after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to the split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977.
    In January 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began re-organizing the MKO and
    recruiting new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities. Still, its
    efforts to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were
    vehemently opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.** Background of
    Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic
    Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated violence in
    Iran and around the world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic
    operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in kidnapping,
    disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose activities
    they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial
    killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders began in
    February 1979 and have continued since then, both inside and outside Iran.
    The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings
    outside Iran attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have
    been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
    in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France,
    Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in
    Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases,
    there has not been much published, and local authorities have not issued
    arrest warrants. But documentation, evidence, and traces obtained through
    investigations conducted by local police and judicial authorities confirm
    the theory of state committed crimes. In some instances, these
    investigations have resulted in the expulsion or arrest of Iranian
    diplomats. In a few cases outside Iran, the perpetrators of these murders
    have been arrested and put on trial. The evidence presented revealed the
    defendants connection to Iran s government institutions, and an arrest
    warrant has been issued for Iran s Minister of Information. The manner in
    which these killings were organized and implemented in Iran and abroad is
    indicative of a single pattern which, according to Roland Chatelin, the
    Swiss prosecutor, contains common parameters and detailed planning. It can
    be ascertained from the simila
