    He was repeatedly summoned to the Zahedan Intelligence Office on charges
    of being a Wahhabi and interrogated in the agency's safe houses under the
    Sistan and Baluchestan Governorate building. Information regarding the
    extrajudicial execution of Abdolaziz Kazemi Bojd, Esma'il's son, was
    gathered through an ABC interview with an informed person on November 6,
    2024. Additional information was gathered from two documentaries broadcast
    by Kalemeh TV on the life and assassination of Mr. Kazemi Bojd (April 4,
    2014; November 8, 2024), the book Wilted Flowers (Martyrs of the Sunni
    Community) (November 2015), and the website of the National Council of
    Sunnis of Iran (December 30, 2022). Abdolaziz Kazemi Bojd was born in
    Zahedan on June 23, 1961. He was married with two children. At the age of
    14, he memorized the entire Quran and completed his elementary and middle
    school education in Zahedan. In 1978, at the age of 17, he traveled to
    Medina, Saudi Arabia, to continue his education and received his high
    school diploma. In 1985, he graduated with honors from the Islamic
    University of Medina with a degree in Arabic Literature. Due to his
    father's illness, he returned to Iran and earned a master s degree in
    Arabic literature from the Islamic Azad University in Tehran in 1994. He
    later completed his Ph.D. in the same field and university in 1996. From
    1993 until his death, Mr. Kazemi Bojd served as the official notary for
    Sunni marriages in Zahedan. From 1994 until two months before his death,
    he also taught at Payam Noor University and Azad University in Zahedan. He
    had previously served as the Friday Prayer Imam in Birjand and led Tarawih
    prayers and Quran recitation sessions at the Noor Mosque in Zahedan. (ABC
    Interview with an Informed Person, November 6, 2024; Wilted Flowers -
    Martyrs of the Sunni Community, November 2015) According to available
    information, Mr. Kazemi Bojd was a courageous and highly respected figure
    in both Baluchestan and Birjand and among religious scholars. He served as
    a role model for the youth and was widely known as a trusted advisor in
    religious and social matters. (National Council of Sunnis of Iran,
    December 30, 2022) He was a gifted orator with a strong command of
    classical Persian poetry, often quoting the works of Hafez and Sa'di in
    his speeches. He was also a close advisor to Molavi Abdolhamid and openly
    condemned the oppression of Sunnis in his university lectures. (Kalemeh
    TV, April 4, 2014; November 8, 2024) Two months before his death, Mr.
    Kazemi Bojd was dismissed from his university position. (Wilted Flowers -
    Martyrs of the Sunni Community, November 2015) According to an informed
    person, he was repeatedly summoned by the Zahedan Intelligence Office on
    accusations of being a Wahhabi and was interrogated in the agency's safe
    houses located under the Sistan and Baluchestan Governorate building in
    Zahedan. The source added that in 1996, during the broadcast of the Imam
    Ali* television series, Mr. Kazemi Bojd criticized the series in his
    university lectures, describing it as filled with "lies and deceit". As a
    result, "the government bore a deep grudge against him. (Kalemeh TV, April
    4, 2014; November 8, 2024) Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history
    of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the
    1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the
    country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since
    then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has
    so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases, there has not been much published, and
    local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
    evidence, and traces obtained through investigations conducted by local
    police and judicial authorities confirm the theory of state committed
    crimes. In some instances, these investigations have resulted in the
    expulsion or arrest of Iranian diplomats. In a few cases outside Iran, the
    perpetrators of these murders have been arrested and put on trial. The
    evidence presented revealed the defendants connection to Iran s government
    institutions, and an arrest warrant has been issued for Iran s Minister of
    Information. The manner in which these killings were organized and
    implemented in Iran and abroad
