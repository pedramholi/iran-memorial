    This unnamed man is among the 64 individuals listed in the United Nations
    Interim Report (11 October 1996) on the Situation of Human Rights in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran prepared by the Special Representative of the
    Commission, Mr. Maurice Danby Copithorne. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone) of proscribed narcotics. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown Arrest and
    detention Based on the report, the defendant was arrested in July, a
    monmth before his execution. The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention remain unknown. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The defendant was charged with murder and drug
    trafficking. Evidence of guilt Reportedly, the defendant was arrested with
    419 kilograms of opium. The report did not refer to any evidence presented
    with regards to the charge of murder. Defense No information is available
    on the defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced this
    man to death. He was hanged at the site of the crime in Shiraz.
