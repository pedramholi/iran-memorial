    Mr. Abdolreza Tapeh Kabudi is among the 64 individuals listed in the
    United Nations Interim Report (11 October 1996) on the Situation of Human
    Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran prepared by the Special
    Representative of the Commission, Mr. Maurice Danby Copithorne. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.

    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
