    Every day, after the morning prayer, Mr. Mobinizadeh would go to his
    father s barber shop on Bahar Street in Mashhad, in order to sell snacks
    in front of the shop. He spent the rest of his time doing housework and
    taking care of his father. News of the disappearance and extrajudicial
    killing of Mr. Jalal Mobinizadeh has been published in Martial Law Weblog,
    quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication (May 9, 2008). Mr. Mobinizadeh s
    name was also printed in a report on the Mojahedin Organization Website
    (December 26, 2016). Additional information about this killing has been
    collected from Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication
    (May 9, 2008), and Falakhan electronic publication #58 (February 2, 2017).
    Mr. Jalal Mobinizadeh was a resident of Mashhad. In 1982 he was arrested
    for supporting the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of Iran, and he spent 20
    months in prison. After he was released, Mr. Mobinizadeh went to the front
    in the war against Iraq (1) and spent a short time as a volunteer
    ambulance driver. He then spent two years fulfilling his service in the
    army. From that time, in addition to his daily activities, he took on the
    responsibility of caring for his father who was old and had had a stroke.
    In April 1995, Mr. Mobinizadeh was arrested by Information Ministry agents
    for an unknown reason, and he was kept in a detention center in Tehran for
    6 months. His family posted their home as bail and had him released. After
    that, Mr. Mobinizadeh returned to Mashhad and he started to sell snacks in
    front of this father s barber shop. Most days, he would ride his bicycle
    to this location after the morning prayer. The rest of his time was spent
    doing housekeeping chores and taking care of his father. The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO) The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was
    founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its
    ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was
    revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. (2) Forced Disappearance And Murder Of
    Mr. Jalal Mobinizadeh At noon on December 31, 1996, Mr. Jalal Mobinizadeh
    was abducted somewhere between Panzdah Khordad Square (Zed Square) and the
    Imam Reza Passenger Terminal in Mashhad. That day, at noon, he left his
    father s barber shop, where he sold snacks every day, to go for lunch and
    noonday prayers to Basij Square (Bargh Square). He was walking and he took
    his bicycle with him. According to his brother in an interview with
    Payam-e Hamun publication, he would have had to ride his bicycle a short
    distance to travel the rest of the way home. Nobody saw him in this part
    of his route. (Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication,
    May 9, 2008) The day before he disappeared, Mr. Mobinizadeh was busy
    planting flowers in front of his father s barber shop. He saw a car parked
    on the street. One of the passengers was his interrogator at the
    Information Ministry Detention Center. According to available evidence,
    Mr. Mobinizadeh was one of the supporters of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who disappeared in connection with the Alghadir Operation,
    carried out by the Information Ministry of the Islamic Republic. This
    operation was designed to kidnap and kill members and supporters of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. There is no information about him or his
    brother in law. Sometime before Mr. Mobinizadeh was kidnapped, thousands
    of prisoners, including members of the Mojahedin Khalq who were considered
    leaders , had been executed during mass killings in the summer of 1989
    (3). According to this information and according to the statements given
    by responsible officials, it is
