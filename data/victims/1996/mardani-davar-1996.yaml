    Mr. Davar Mardani is among the 64 individuals listed in the United Nations
    Interim Report (11 October 1996) on the Situation of Human Rights in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran prepared by the Special Representative of the
    Commission, Mr. Maurice Danby Copithorne. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
