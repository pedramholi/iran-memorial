    Mr. Rahman Rajabi Hamvand is among the 64 individuals listed in the United
    Nations Interim Report (11 October 1996) and the United Nations Report (21
    March 1996) on the Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran prepared by the Special Representative of the Commission, Mr. Maurice
    Danby Copithorne. Mr. Rajabi Hamvand was reportedly a member of the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDIK). Based on the Interim Report,
    the Special Representative requested information on the case of this
    person in February 1996 while he was in Tehran and sent two letters, dated
    7 May and 19 July 1996, requesting the Government to ensure that this
    person could fully benefit from all the internationally recognized
    procedural safeguards provided for in the International Covenant on Civil
    and Political Rights and in the annex to Economic and Social Council
    resolution 1984/50 of 25 May 1984, entitled "Safeguards guaranteeing
    protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty". Arrest and
    detention Based on the reports, the defendant was detained at Darya Prison
    in Orumiyeh. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Based on the March 21 report, "[Mr. Rajabi Hamvand] had been
    convicted on charges of murder, plunder and brigandage, being an active
    member of an armed terrorist group, participating in assassination of
    civilians and terrorizing people in Kurdistan province, according to the
    information provided to the Special Representative on 15 February1996 by
    Mr. Rahbar Poor, head of the Revolutionary Courts of Tehran, and by the
    Permanent Representative." The Interim Report also noted that "this
    person's trial was initiated by a private complaint of an individual who
    reportedly had personal differences with him but who subsequently
    renounced his complaint." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rajabi Hamvand's
    defense. However, according to the Special Representative, the defendant
    denied the charge of assassination. Judgment Mr. Rajabi Hamvand was
    sentenced to death in October 1995. Following the Special Representative's
    request for information about this case, he was informed by the Permanent
    Representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations
    Office at Geneva, by letter dated 29 February 1996, that the Supreme Court
    had confirmed the death sentence. Based on the Interim Report, the
    defendant's request for clemency was rejected by the Amnesty Council and
    he was executed.
