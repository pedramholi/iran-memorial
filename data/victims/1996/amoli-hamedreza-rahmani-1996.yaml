    Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Hamedreza Rahmani
    Amoli was published on the websites of Mojahedin Khalq Organization (March
    18, 2007) and Pishtazan-e Rah-e Azadi Iran Mazandaran Province (December
    17, 2017). Based on the available information, Mr. Rahmani Amolu was
    married and had a son. He had a high school diploma and was a member of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in Iraq. His wife was killed during the
    Forugh Javidan operation in Iran in 1988. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released, along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and to recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of
    Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of politically
    motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the 1979
    Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the country
    have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of
    individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of
    the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however,
    these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since then, both
    inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far
    identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases there has not been much published and
    the local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
    evidence, and traces obtained through investigations conducted by local
    police and judicial authorities confirm, however, the theory of state
    committed crimes. In certain cases, these investigations have resulted in
    the expulsion or arrest of Iranian diplomats. In limited cases outside
    Iran, the perpetrators of these murders have been arrested and put on
    trial and the evidence presented, revealed the defendants connection to
    Iran s government institutions, and an arrest warrant has been issued for
    Iran s Minister of Information. The manner in which these killings were
    organized and implemented in Iran and abroad, is indicative of a single
    pattern which, according to Roland Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor,
    contains common parameters and detailed planning. It can be ascertained
    from the similarities between these murders in different countries that
    the Iranian government is the principal entity who ordered the
    implementation of these crimes. Iranian authorities have not officially
    accepted responsibility for these murders and have even attributed their
    commission to internal strife in opposition groups. Nevertheless, since
    the very inception of the Islamic Republic regime, the Islamic Republic
    officials have justified these crimes from an ideological and legal
    standpoint. In the spring of 1979, Sadeq Khalkhali, the first Chief Shari
    a Judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts, officially announced the
    regime s decision to implement extrajudicial executions, and justified the
    decision: These people have been sentenced to death; from the Iranian
    people s perspective, if someone wants to assassinate these individuals
    abroad, in any country, no government has any right to bring t
