    Information regarding the life and extra-judicial killing of Mr. Abubakr
    (Kamran) Hedayati, the son of Khan Hassan Hedayati, born in 1949 in the
    village of Hajj Kand, in the Bukan region, West Azerbaijan province in
    Iran, has been obtained through Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human
    Rights (ABC) interview conducted with a family member of Mr. Hedayati
    (September 21, 2021); Swedish newspapers Dagens Nyheter (January 19, 20,
    1994); Svenska Dagbladet (January 19, 20, 1994); Uppsala Nya Tidning,
    January 19, 1994; Amnesty International Report: Iran - Official secrecy
    hides continuing repression MDE 13/02/95 DISTR: SC/CO/GR/CC/PO; the
    Swedish documentary Terrorkommandot (released in 2002); Swedish
    documentary I nationens intresse (released in 2003) and Expressen (29
    September, 2003). Mr. Hedayati lost his father at the age of three when
    his mother was only 21 years old. His mother never remarried and raised
    the children herself. Mr. Hedayati s elder brother, Seyyed Umar Hedayati,
    was a political leader opposed to the Shah and was imprisoned at
    Khoramabad prison for a year, where he was tortured and then exiled to
    Kashmir. Mr. Hedayati postponed his university studies so he could take
    care of his mother and support his family while the elder brother was in
    prison. He studied chemistry at Arak University and received his bachelor
    s degree in 1976/77 (ABC interview with family member of Mr. Hedayati).
    Mr. Hedayati married his wife, Mrs. Parvin Hassankhali in 1979. They moved
    to Kermanshah where he taught chemistry. After the fall of the monarchy in
    February 1979, they contacted friends in the PDKI party to form a party
    committee in Kermanshah and soon ended up leading the party in Kermanshah
    (ABC interview with family member of Mr. Hedayati). After the revolution,
    13 death sentences were issued for individuals residing in Kermanshah. Mr.
    Hedayati and Mrs. Hassankhali were among the individuals given a death
    sentence, but they were able to escape. [1] They were informed by a
    Kurdish army officer, who was secretly a member of the party, that they
    needed to leave immediately. They packed everything they could and drove
    off to Bukan, West Azerbaijan province. Their house in Kermanshah was
    seized after they had fled. All of the other individuals were executed on
    August 19, 1979 [2] (ABC interview with a family member of Mr. Hedayati).
    During their time in Bukan, Mr. Hedayati was very involved in the party s
    organizational work. He was first appointed party official and soon
    elected representative of the people of Bukan. The couple were sent on
    missions to Qatur and Orumieh, West Azerbaijan province, to spread party
    propaganda. Mr. Hedayati was now part of the central committee of the
    PDKI, and Mrs. Hassankhali was party cadre while also working for the
    party radio station and teaching. At first, all of their activities were
    conducted in hiding, but soon, they were conducted in public. By 1985, Mr.
    Hedayati suffered from severe health issues. His liver fibrosis required a
    liver transplant, and the PDKI arranged for him and his wife to be sent to
    Stockholm, Sweden. They arrived in Sweden in September 1985. The couple
    started over in Sweden and started learning the language. They both
    continued to be active dissidents and politically active within the party.
    In 1992, they adopted a boy whose parents had been killed in Mahabad. In
    1993, after a long wait, Mr. Hedayati successfully underwent a liver
    transplant. Mr. Hedayati is remembered as a man who had a positive outlook
    on life and strongly believed in women s rights to equality. He encouraged
    women, including his spouse, to get education and work side by side with
    men (ABC interview with a family member of Mr. Hedayati). The Kurdish
    Problem in the Islamic Republic After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the
    disagreements between the government of the Shiite Islamic Republic and
    the organizations in the Kurdish regions of western Iran regarding the
    rights and roles of minorities in drafting the Constitution; whether the
    government should be secular or religious, and especially the issue of
    Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in Kurdish political
    organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on instituting an
    Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed, clashes between the
    central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan Democratic Party s armed
    forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini labeled the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and most influential Kurdish
    Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it unofficial and illegal and
    ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass executions and intense armed
    clashes continued in the region for months, clashes that resulted in the
    deaths of a number of civilians and the displacement and relocation of the
    residents of certain towns. In the next four years, Kurdish parties lost
    their grip on power in the region to a great extent, and relocated to
    Iraqi Kurdistan. Since then, a nu
