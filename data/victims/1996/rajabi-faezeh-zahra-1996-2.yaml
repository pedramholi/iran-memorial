    She studied architecture in Iran and like many other students, ended up
    joining an opposition group to fight the Islamic Republic. But the deadly
    hand of Iran s summary justice extended into Turkey. News and information
    about the extrajudicial execution of Ms. Fa'ezeh (Zahra) Rajabi, who was
    known as Maryam Jokar in Turkey, has been obtained from the indictment
    issued against Tohid Salam and IRGC Qods Force groups in Turkey
    (June/July/August 2000), the verdict issued by the 11th branch of the
    Ankara Criminal Court (July 28, 2005), the website of the Turkish
    newspaper Hurriyet (January 24, 1997), reports of the United Nations Human
    Rights Commission (October 15, 1997, and August 23, 1998), Iran Efshagar
    (February 20, 2020) and the annual report of Amnesty International (2000).
    Additional information about this case has been obtained from the
    electronic form sent to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC) by one of
    the relatives of Mr. Ali Panah Moradi, who was killed with her (January
    27, 2017), and other sources* Ms. Rajabi was born in Tehran in 1957, and
    was married. While studying architecture at the National University
    (Beheshti University) in Tehran, she was active in student political
    activities against the Pahlavi government, and after the victory of the
    Islamic Revolution, she became a member of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. (Be Suye Piruzi, July 26, 2016) After the beginning of the
    Mojahedin Khalq s armed actions on June 20, 1981, she became a commander
    of one of this party s operational bases. In 1984, she became a member of
    the Central Committee and Executive Board of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Beginning in 1988, Ms. Rajabi was commander of one of the
    divisions of the liberation army for two years, participated in this party
    s Operation Eternal Light, and then worked as the commander of the seventh
    division of the liberation army in the field of support, training and
    readying of this army s combat units. (Qiyam ta Azadi, September 27, 2020)
    In 1991, she became responsible for the central office of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization outside Iran, and in the winter of 1995, she became
    responsible for defending the rights of Iranian refugees in Turkey. At the
    time of her death, Ms. Rajabi was a member of the Mojahedin Leadership
    Council and a member of the National Council of the Resistance. (Iran
    Efshagar, February 23, 2020; Iran Asrar, February 20, 2016) She was also
    the organization s representative in France. (Cumhuriyet newspaper, June
    5, 1998) Ms. Rajabi went to Turkey for the last time on January 28, 1996,
    and was supposed to leave Turkey in late February or early March of the
    same year. (Iran Efshagar, February 23, 2020; Iran Asrar, February 20,
    2016) The Mojahedin Khalq Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adopted the principles of
    Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of
    Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in an armed struggle against
    the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive economic and
    social analysis method but considered Islam their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975 following a profound
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology, and
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to the
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January 1979,
    the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with other
    political prisoners. They began re-organizing the MKO and recruiting new
    members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities. Still, its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were vehemently
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders.** Background of Extrajudicial
    Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has
    a long history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the
    world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and
    outside the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing
    a large number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable.
    The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is
    not clear; however, these murders began in February 1979 and have
    continued since then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings outside
