    Information about the extrajudicial killing of Mohammad Baqer Yusefi,
    married father of two (9-year-old Rasmina and 7-year-old Stephen), was
    collected from an interview with his wife conducted by Article 18
    published September 28, 2020 (A18), a November 11, 1996 article by
    Christianity Today (CT), an Amnesty International report dated April 10,
    1997, Kalameh articles dated April 5, 2005 and January 2, 2020, a speech
    by Intelligence Minister Sa d Emami given in Autumn of 1996 and published
    to YouTube on November 17, 2020 (SE), an undated publication from
    Farsinet.com (FN), and an IranWire article published May 25, 2021 (IW).
    Background information about the persecution of Christians in Iran was
    collected from 1993, 1995, and 1996 annual reports by Human Rights Watch
    (HRW), reports from the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human
    rights in Iran dated January 28, 1993 and September 23, 1998 (UN), a 2003
    report by the International Federation of Human Rights (IFHR), an article
    published in the International Journal for Religious Freedom in January
    2009 (IJRF), a 2013 report by the International Campaign for Human Rights
    in Iran (ICHRI), a 2015 report by the Suuntaus project, an article
    published in Mission Studies in April 2015 (MS), a report by the Center
    for Human Rights in Iran published December 19, 2016 (CHR), and a 2020
    survey conducted by the Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in
    Iran (Gamaan). Mohammad Baqer Yusefi was born in the early 1960 s
    (1340-1343) in Mazandaran province, Iran (ABC research). He was raised in
    a Muslim family (FN) and took an interest in spiritual matters from
    childhood. At age 24 he converted to Christianity and attended Garden of
    Sharon Bible School in Karaj before being appointed a pastor himself in
    1990 by Haik Hovsepian Mehr [1] (Kalameh 2005, CT) and began pastoring
    Assembly of God churches in the cities of Sari, Qaemshahr, and Gorgan
    (FN), all three of which had been operating underground since being
    forcibly closed by the Ministry of Islamic Guidance (CT). In 1984, despite
    their modest means, Reverend Yusefi and his wife, also a Christian
    convert, took in the sons of Reverend Mehdi Dibaj [2], aged 16 and 14,
    when the latter was imprisoned for evangelism (Kalameh 2005). Based on
    available information, Reverend Yusefi demonstrated broad reach as a
    religious leader. He was an active supporter of Jama at-e Rabbani,
    previously the largest congregation of Persian-speaking protestants in
    Tehran (Suuntaus, CHR). In Mazandaran he became a key support to the
    regional faith community, and his services began to draw in congregants
    from remote villages. He was given the nickname Ravanbakhsh, or soul-giver
    in Persian (FN). Reverend Yusefi continued to provide religious and
    community services despite persistent warnings from the Intelligence
    Ministry to cease his activities (Kalameh 2005, IW). Background While
    Christianity counts among the three Abrahamic religions officially
    recognized in Iran, the status carved out for Christians by the
    Constitution and civil and penal code is markedly inferior. In practice,
    religious tolerance applies only to ethnic groups who are historically
    Christian, i.e. Armenians and Assyrians, and not to believers or converts
    from Muslim backgrounds (UN 1992). The Iranian government has implemented
    policies that demarcate, monitor, and aggressively suppress Christian
    civic presence. The Constitution bars Christians from becoming President,
    members of the Guardian Council, Army Commanders, School Principals, and
    from holding senior government positions (UN 1998, IFHR). They are
    prohibited from running in General Parliamentary elections, and the three
    seats allocated to Christians in Parliament are exclusively for Armenian,
    Assyrian, and Chaldean representatives (IFHR). Civil and criminal statutes
    explicitly disadvantage Christian parties. They are entitled to less
    compensation in car-accident settlements and cannot inherit property from
    Muslims (UN 1998, IFHR). Several offenses punishable by lashings for
    Muslims are for Christians punishable by death. The activities of
    Christian churches and peoples have long been subject to Ministry of
    Culture surveillance. A law purporting to flag sellers of non-halal foods
    requires Christian shop owners to display signs reading designated for
    religious minorities; in practice, this signage has been enforced on all
    Christian businesses as a deterrent to Muslim patrons (UN 1998).
    Christians have reported denials of academic admissions and business
    permits on religious grounds (Suuntaus). By the mid-90s all but two
    Protestant churches had closed under various government pressures,
    including demands to provide congregants names and personal information
    (Suuntaus, HRW 1995). Since the revolution, hundreds of Christians have
    been detained arbitrarily. Many are sentenced to various prison terms and
    others are released with the specter of charges and investigations against
    them that are left open indefinitely. Multip
