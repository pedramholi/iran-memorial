    Mr. Bakhtiari during his visit to Evin prison in Tehran on 13 February
    1996. Mr. Bakhtiari’s case was also mentioned in an August 1996 news
    release by Amnesty International, which expressed concern about “many, if
    not most” of the trials in that year being “unfair.” Reportedly, Mr.
    Bakhtiari, an agricultural engineer by profession, was a member of the
    People’s Fedaiyan Organization of Iran (Minority). Arrest and detention

    defendant were not specified. Evidence of guilt There is no information

    Amnesty Board.
