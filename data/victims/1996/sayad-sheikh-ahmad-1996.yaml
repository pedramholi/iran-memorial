    Information about the extra-judicial killing of Sheikh Ahmad Sayad, also
    known as Molavi Ahmad Mirin, was collected from articles and video by the
    Baluch Campaign (2/14/16, 2/16/2016), a video broadcast by Kalameh TV
    (5/31/18), a report from the UN Commission on Human Rights (3/21/96), a
    BBC interview with an attendee of his funeral on February 3, 1996
    published to YouTube on October 30, 2009, and a post on the weblog of the
    Dar Al-Sunnah Institute in Zarabad, of which Mr. Sayad was the founder and
    custodian. Background information was obtained from 1997 reports by Human
    Rights Watch, a 2016 article by the Middle East Institute, a 2017 article
    from Al-Monitor, and a 2018 report by Minority Rights Group International.
    In 1946 in Ganjak, one of a few villages in Karvan, Sistan and Baluchestan
    Province, Dr. Sayad was born into a family of modest means. Economic
    hardship prompted his family to relocate throughout his childhood, to
    Sindh and then Karachi, Pakistan before moving back to Karvan. Dr. Sayad
    studied Hanafi jurisprudence under the guidance of his uncle, a Mullah,
    when he was a teenager (DAI). Later when his father moved to Doha, Qatar
    to improve the family s financial situation, Dr. Sayad by this time a
    young man went with him. Dr. Sayad was a Baluch and religious
    institutional leader within the Salafi branch of Sunni Islam. Dr. Sayad
    headed a mosque there before receiving help from a mosque trustee and
    well-known Sheikh to pursue undergraduate studies in Madina, Saudi Arabia.
    He chose to study the Hadith, or the intricate collection and conservation
    of the prophet s words and actions from different source accounts
    throughout history, and obtained master s and doctoral degrees in Hadith
    sciences (DAI). His studies afforded him a network and knowledge base in
    the fields of ethics, Arabic language, and jurisprudence. While these
    credentials could have earned him prestigious positions outside Iran he
    preferred to return home in the Iranian year 1364 (March 21, 1985 March
    20, 1986) and established a mosque and a quranic school called the Dar
    Al-Sunnah Institute in Zarabad, a remote village in Baluchistan (DAI).
    Those who knew Sayad spoke of a dignified man with a humble appearance who
    devoted his life to religious studies and to others. He took active part
    in his family s household chores, did yard work at the mosque, unclogged
    pipes in the mosque bathroom, and refused to have items brought to him. He
    moved congregants both through his sermons and the down-to-earth way that
    he lived; even those with whom he had differences spoke highly of him, and
    people travelled from all over Iran just to meet with him. First Arrest
    and Imprisonment Dr. Sayad travelled to Saudi Arabia each year to raise
    funds for his mosque (BBC), and had been running it for two years when he
    was arrested in the Iranian year 1367 (3/21/88 3/20/89) (DAI). He spent
    five years confined to Evin prison, an ordeal that he said was
    transformative for him and emboldened his faith. Upon his release he went
    back to developing his institute in Zarabad, though loved ones implored
    him to leave Iran for his personal safety (DAI, BBC). One year and nine
    months after his release from prison, Dr. Sayad began getting summons to
    Zahedan, where he was interrogated multiple times (BBC). Background
    Believed to make up one to three percent of the country s population
    (ABC), Baluchi ethnic groups make up the majority of the population in
    Sistan-Baluchistan, where 64-77 percent of residents live below the
    poverty line. Despite having abundant gas, oil, gold, and marine
    resources, approximately two thirds of residents lack access to clean
    drinking water, and economic policies have allowed it to remain one of the
    poorest-sourced provinces in education, health, and food. Civil unrest in
    the region has given way to militant opposition groups and fatal
    skirmishes. In moving to bring the region under tighter control, the
    government has resorted to violence, including assassinations, as well as
    arbitrary arrests of peaceful human rights defenders. Ten Baluch civil
    rights activists were arbitrarily detained between March and September of
    2017 alone (MRG). Iran's Baluch minority are mostly Sunni Muslims, whereas
    the majority of Iran s population are Shi'a Muslims. Policies and actions
    from authorities have been restrictive toward the practice of Sunni Islam,
    e.g. limiting and even blocking the construction of Sunni mosques in
    majority-Sh ia areas (including Tehran), arbitrary closure of Sunni prayer
    halls and celebratory gatherings, and violence from security forces
    towards groups of Sunnis praying in public (MRG, HRW: Religious
    Minorities, AL). Lack of institutional support pushes Sunni leaders to
    pursue study in Pakistan or Saudi Arabia, a trend which has historically
    aroused government suspicion due both to the hostility of Wahabism (the
    dominant branch of Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia) towards Shiism, and to the
    political tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Baluch
