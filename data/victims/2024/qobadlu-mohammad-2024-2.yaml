    Despite his bipolar disorder, Mohammad Qobadlu was denied access to his
    medication for the first two months of his detention and throughout the
    interrogation process. Information regarding the execution of Mohammad
    Qobadlu, son of Alimadad and Masumeh, was taken from statements by his
    lawyer Mahdokht Dehghanpur (Didban, March 4, 2024) and the Mizan News
    Agency (January 23, 2024). Additional information was obtained from his
    lawyer Amir Ra'isian's posts on the social media platform X (October 30,
    2022; January 23 and 24, 2024), as well as reports from BBC Persian
    (December 10, 2022), Radio Zamaneh (January 9, 2023), Shargh Network (May
    27, 2023), Mizan News Agency (November 2, December 10, and January 23,
    2024), Tasnim News Agency (December 24, 2022, and January 23, 2024),
    Tabnak (January 23, 2024), Radio Farda (January 23, 2024), the Instagram
    page of Mohammad Qobadlu's mother, Masumeh Ahmadi (February 19, 2024), and
    a post by Habib Daneshvar on X (May 24, 2024). Mohammad Qobadlu worked as
    a barber (Radio Zamaneh, January 9, 2023). Since 2016, he had been
    receiving treatment for bipolar disorder at Milad Hospital in Shahriyar
    (BBC Persian, December 10, 2022). He was also exempted from military
    service after receiving a red card - an official exemption granted by the
    Armed Forces Medical Commission based on mental health conditions (Post by
    Habib Daneshvar, Qobadlu's cellmate in Fashafouyeh Prison, X, May 24,
    2024). Mohammad Qobadlu was the ninth person arrested during the
    nationwide "Woman, Life, Freedom" protests to be hanged by the judiciary.
    2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest background Nationwide protests were sparked by
    the death in custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on
    September 16, 2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality police in
    Tehran for improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead to the
    hospital. The protests, which started in front of the hospital and
    continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa was
    buried, were triggered by popular exasperation over the morality patrols,
    misleading statements of the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s
    death and the resulting impunity for the violence used against detainees,
    as well as the mandatory veil in general. This protest, initially led by
    young girls and women who burned their veils and youth in general who
    chanted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom, rapidly took on a clear
    anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an end to the Islamic
    Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was unprecedented. State
    efforts to withdraw the morality police from the streets and preventative
    arrests of journalists and political and civil society activists did not
    stop the protests. By the end of December 2022, protests had taken place
    in about 164 cities and towns, including localities that had never
    witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities, high schools, businesses,
    and groups including oil workers, merchants of the Tehran bazaar (among
    others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom had been arrested as of
    February 1st, 2023), artists, athletes, and even doctors joined these
    protests in various forms. Despite the violent crackdown and mass arrests,
    intense protests continued for weeks, at least through November 2022, with
    reports of sporadic activity continuing through the beginning of 2023. The
    State s crackdown was swift and accompanied by intermittent landline and
    cellular internet network shutdowns, as well as threats against and
    arrests of victims family members, factors which posed a serious challenge
    to monitoring protests and documenting casualties. The security forces
    used illegal, excessive, and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and
    military assault rifles against protesters. They often targeted protesters
    heads and chests, shot them at close range, and in the back. Security
    forces have targeted faces with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to
    lose their eyesight, and according to some reports women s genitalia. The
    bloodiest crackdown took place on September 30th in Zahedan, Baluchestan
    Province, where a protest began at the end of the Friday sermon. The death
    toll is reported to be above 90 for that day. Many injured protesters,
    fearing arrest, did not go to hospitals where security forces have
    reportedly arrested injured protesters before and after they were treated.
    By February 1, 2023, the Human Rights Activists News Agency reported the
    number of recorded protests to be 1,262. The death toll, including
    protesters and passersby, stood at 527, of whom 71 were children. The
    number of arrests (including of wounded protesters) was estimated at
    19,603, of whom 766 had already been tried and convicted. More than 100
    protesters were at risk of capital punishment, and four had been executed
    in December 2022 and January 2023 without minimum standards of due
    process. Authorities also claimed 70 casualties among state forces, though
    there are consistent reports from families of killed prot
