    Reza was a quiet, gentle young man who was focused on his own life. Still,
    he was deeply affected by the world around him. He often observed the
    lives of others and the challenges they faced. With a heavy heart, he
    would say, "People can't even afford a piece of bread." Information
    regarding the execution of Gholam Reza Rasa i, son of Azardokht and Morad
    Ali, was published on August 6, 2025, by the Islamic Republic News Agency
    (IRNA), citing the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor, as well as by
    Mizan News Agency, Kurdpa (Kurdistan Press Agency), and HRANA (Human
    Rights Activists News Agency). Additional information was obtained from
    the written verdict issued by Branch 2 of the Criminal Court One of
    Kermanshah Province (December 16, 2023); HRANA (November 20, 2022, and
    October 14, 2023); Kayhan London, quoting one of Mr. Rasa i s relatives
    (February 8 and October 14, 2023); Mizan News Agency (November 18, 2022);
    an interview by the Legal Counseling and Training Center for Activists
    (Dadban) with Mr. Rasa i s fianc e, Hana; his brother; and several legal
    experts (November 24, 2025); and the Kurdistan Human Rights Network
    (September 23, 2025). According to available information, Gholam Reza Rasa
    i was single, born in, and living in Sahneh, a city in Kermanshah
    Province. He had a bachelor's degree in business management and worked as
    a beekeeper and honey vendor. After losing his father at age eleven, he
    became the family s breadwinner. He was a follower of the Yarsan faith.*
    According to those close to him: "Reza was a quiet, humble young man who
    kept to himself. But he was deeply disheartened by the daily injustices he
    witnessed. He would observe the lives of others and sorrowfully say,
    'People don't even have bread to eat. Why are these things happening? Why
    has it come to this? Aren t we supposed to live under equal conditions?
    (Interview with Dadban Legal Counseling and Training Center for Activists,
    November 24, 2022). On November 18, 2022, Rasa i participated in the
    twenty-first annual memorial ceremony for Seyyed Khalil Alinejad**, a
    prominent Kurdish Yarsani leader. The event is held annually in the city
    of Sahneh in Kermanshah Province and coincided with the Woman, Life,
    Freedom protests sparked by the state killing of Jina (Mahsa) Amini that
    year. Over 2,000 followers of the Yarsan faith from across Iran gathered
    at Alinejad s gravesite to honor his memory. Although security forces were
    regularly present at the ceremony, it had remained peaceful in previous
    years. However, in 2022, the gathering turned violent due to the
    intervention of security forces: "Security forces disrupted the ceremony,
    resorting to gunfire and tear gas." More than 30 individuals were
    arrested. (HRANA November 20, 2022). A participant in the ceremony said:
    "In all previous years, not even a nosebleed occurred, let alone
    bloodshed. But this time, one officer died because of their unjustified
    intervention. No one else was involved. (Interview with Dadban November
    24, 2022) According to one of Rasa i s relatives: "A few days before the
    ceremony, the IRGC's Intelligence Organization contacted Reza and summoned
    him. They tried to obtain a written pledge that he would not attend the
    event. But he refused and went anyway. During the ceremony, he held a
    poster of his cousin, Kheyrollah Haqjuyan, who is a political prisoner,
    and chanted for his release: Free Kheyrollah Haqjuyan! The source added:
    "On the day of the ceremony, the city was under de facto martial law.
    There were military vehicles and a heavy presence of riot police." (Kayhan
    London, February 8, 2023). The case brought against Mr. Rasa i and ten
    other individuals (some of whom are still at large) relates to the death
    of an officer during the November 18, 2022, memorial ceremony for Seyyed
    Khalil Alinejad in Sahneh. Arrest and detention After attending the
    memorial ceremony for Seyyed Khalil Alinejad, Mr. Rasa i went to Karaj. On
    November 24, 2022, officials from the Kermanshah Criminal Investigation
    Department arrested him in Shahriar, Tehran Province. He was transferred
    to Sahneh, without notification to his family. According to Mr. Rasa i s
    brother: Reza was arrested and taken to Sahneh, and we had no idea. They
    raided our home multiple times. He was taken to the Criminal Investigation
    Department in Sahneh. We knew nothing about his whereabouts. Nearly a week
    later, they informed us that Reza was at the Sahneh Criminal Investigation
    Department, but when we went there, they wouldn t give us any answers.
    (Interview with Dadban Legal Counseling and Training Center for Activists,
    November 24, 2022). Following his interrogation, Mr. Rasa i was
    transferred to Ward 7 of Dizelabad Prison in Kermanshah, where he remained
    for two and a half months. He was then transferred to the Kermanshah
    Criminal Investigation Department detention center for an additional 21
    days, alongside several other detainees. During this period, all contact
    with his family was cut off. (Kayhan London, Fe
