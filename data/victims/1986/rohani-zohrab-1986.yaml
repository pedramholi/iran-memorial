    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot

    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.

    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
