    Information about Ms. Sheida Behzadi Tehrani s arrest and death was
    obtained from an interview with one of her relatives who was also her
    friend in the Organization (August 29, 2008), an article by Ms. Banoo
    Saberi, another of her friends in the Organization, published on the
    Akhbar-e Rooz website (August 28, 2009), an interview with one of the
    individuals in charge of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Majority)
    (November 23, 2017), as well as writings by other friends of hers in the
    Organization. Ms. Behzadi Tehrani was born into a well-to-do and educated
    family in the city of Esfahan. She was 27 years old, married, and had a
    daughter. She was a geology student at Esfahan University prior to the
    closure of universities due to the Cultural Revolution. She joined the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization in 1979. Initially, she was active in the
    student organizations, and, subsequent to a split in the Organization, she
    became active in the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Majority). She was in
    charge of the Organization s women s section while she was still living in
    Esfahan, and was also a member of the Organization s provincial committee.
    She and her spouse went underground after a while, and she was then
    transferred to Tehran in 1982-83, to continue her organizational
    activities. Her husband, Mr. Sa eed Tabatabai, was executed in the 1988
    mass killings of political prisoners. She was a shy, talented, and
    motivated woman. A friend of hers reports: I lived with her and Sa eed in
    a house in Esfahan. She was a steadfast friend. She was not into deception
    and playing games. She was a beautiful woman. At the time when the
    government was most oppressive, Sheida, with the utmost courage, humanity,
    and selflessness, had given shelter to members of an opposing political
    group who were in danger of being arrested, an act that risked putting her
    and her family in danger. All of Sheida s political friends and comrades
    praised and lauded her honesty and sincerity (quoted from one of the
    Organization s officials). The Cultural Revolution was started upon a
    decree by Ayatollah Khomeini in April 1980 in order to purge universities
    of opposition groups and transform them into environments for teaching
    Islamic courses and curricula. The first wave of violence occurred on
    April 15 at Tabriz University where Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was speaking.
    The student supporters of the regime occupied the University s central
    building and demanded that the university be purged of individuals they
    called elements connected to the Shah s regime and other sell-outs . On
    April 18, the Council of the Revolution issued a statement in which it
    accused political groups of turning higher education institutions into
    headquarters for divisive political operations and of being a barrier to
    fundamental change in universities. The statement gave these groups three
    days (from Saturday, April 19, 1980, to Monday, April 21, 1980) to close
    their university offices. The Council of the Revolution stressed that the
    decision included libraries as well as artistic and athletic offices.
    Political opposition groups refused to close their offices, and skirmishes
    continued between leftist students and Islamic Associations, who were able
    to gain control of the universities with the support of governmental
    forces and pro-government militias. The wave of violence reached its
    highest level when the Council of Revolution s deadline came, and hundreds
    were injured and several were killed in universities across the country.
    On April 21, the victory of the Cultural Revolution was declared, and
    universities were shut down for two years. As a result of the Cultural
    Revolution, a large number of university professors were purged and
    numerous students were prevented from continuing their education because
    of their political beliefs. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Majority considered the Islamic Republic to be a revolutionary and
    anti-imperialist regime and supported it. After the spring of 1983,
    however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely because of their
    political beliefs. Arrest and detention On August 3, 1986, Ms. Behzadi
    Tehrani and her spouse were arrested by Information Ministry agents at
    their home in Tehran, and taken to Comiteh Moshtarak (Towhid) Prison
    (Interview). She was in prison with her two-year-old daughter for a while;
    she then entrusted her daughter to her husband s family. She spent 39 days
    in that prison. Ms. Saberi had heard Behzadi Tehrani s voice at the
    Comiteh Moshtarak Prison when she had been talking to her daughter. Ms.
    Behzadi Tehrani had no visitations in prison and it is not clear how she
