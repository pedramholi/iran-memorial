    The execution of Mr. Haji Jahanian, along with another defendant, was

    There is no information regarding this trial. Charges According to this
    report, Mr. Jahanian was charged with participation in transporting 60 kg
    of opium as well as dealing 420 kg of opium. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Jahanian's defense. Judgment
    The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Bakhtaran sentenced Mr. Jahanian to
    death. Having been confirmed by Qom s Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out in public.
