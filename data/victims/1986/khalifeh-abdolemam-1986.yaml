    The execution of Mr. Abdolemam Khalifeh, son of Ali, along with two
    others, was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on February 26, 1986. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Khalifeh was affiliated with the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He and two other men were collectively
    charged with “martyring a committed worker of the Hezbollah [Party of God]
    named Omati during the holy month of Ramadan, espionage for the Bath
    regime in Iraq, participation in military operations against the forces of
    Islam in Kordestan fronts, receiving weapons from the enemies in the Bath
    regime and intention to assassinate some of the oppressed and pious
    persons, loyal to the Islamic Republic.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Khalifeh’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Ahvaz declared Mr. Khalifeh a “corruptor on earth and an enemy
    of God” and sentenced him to death. He and two other persons were executed
    on February 24, 1986 at dawn.
