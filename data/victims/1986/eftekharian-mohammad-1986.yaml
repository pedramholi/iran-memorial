    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Eftekharian, along with another defendant,
    was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on May 21, 1986. The report states:
    “The Public Prosecutor of Karaj warned all corruptors and criminals, who
    promote evil deeds and prostitution and intend to corrupt the Islamic
    community. He asked people to inform the judiciary and law enforcement
    officials about such matters so that Islamic principles would be
    implemented.” Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Mr. Eftekharian was tried at the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Karaj. No other information is available
    on the trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Eftekharian was
    charged with “promoting evil deeds and establishing corruption and
    prostitution centers.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Eftekharian’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Karaj sentenced Mr. Eftekharian to death by stoning. The Supreme Judicial
    Council confirmed the sentence. He and another man were stoned to death in
    public on April 23, 1986.
