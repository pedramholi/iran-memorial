    The execution of Mr. Qorban Ali Qasemi was reported in the Kayhan daily on
    February 2, 1986. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr.
    Qasemi was charged with first-degree murder. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Qasemi's defense. Judgment The 13th branch of Shiraz’s
    Penal Court I sentenced Mr. Qasemi to death. After being confirmed by the
    Supreme Court, the sentence (Qesas or the law of Talion) was carried out
    in front of the victim’s relatives in Shiraz Adelabad Prison in the
    morning.
