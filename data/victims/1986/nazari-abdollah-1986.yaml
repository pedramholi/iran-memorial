    The execution of Mr. Abdollah Nazari, son of Nazar, along with another
    defendant, was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on April 21, 1986. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Nazari was charged with murder. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Nazari’s defense. Judgment The Penal
    Court of Shiraz sentenced Mr. Nazari to death. After the Supreme Court
    approved the sentence, he and another man were executed on April 20, 1986
    at Adel Abad prison in Shiraz.
