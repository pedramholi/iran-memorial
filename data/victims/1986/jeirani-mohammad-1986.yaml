    The execution of Mr. Mohammad (Mahmud) Jeirani, a member of the
    Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, was reported in the Kayhan daily on March
    3, 1986. The newspaper refers to Mr. Jeirani first as Mohammad and later
    as Mahmud. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Jeirani was
    charged with “being a member of [the Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO)]
    and the assassination of 3 members of the Hezbollah forces.” The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Jeirani's defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Bakhtaran sentenced Mr. Jeirani to death. Having
    been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried
    out in the presence of the martyrs’ relatives.
