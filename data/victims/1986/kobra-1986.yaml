    The execution of Ms. Kobra, along with another defendant, was reported in
    the Kayhan newspaper on May 21, 1986. This report does not mention Ms.
    Kobra’s last name. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Ms.
    Kobra was charged with “corruption, prostitution and adultery.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Kobra’s defense. Judgment The Religious
    Judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Hamedan sentenced Ms. Kobra
    to death. The Supreme Judicial Council approved the sentence. She and
    another woman were executed in Hamedan on May 20, 1986.
