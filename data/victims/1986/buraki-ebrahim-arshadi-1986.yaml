    The execution of Mr. Ebrahim Arshadi Buraki, son of Darab, along with 6
    others, was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on November 23, 1986.
    Additional infomration was provided to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center via an
    electronic form on January 30, 2019 by a person who knew Mr. Arshadi
    Buraki. The Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecution Office of Shiraz,
    announced in a communiqu : The active devoted security and law enforcement
    officers have purified our sacred land of the remnants of these thugs and
    corruptors in a way that no one dares even think of committing a crime.
    For the last time we warn the criminals not to commit anti-human and
    shameful acts, otherwise they will have the same ominous destiny as these
    criminals. Arrest and detention Mr. Arshadi Buraki was arrested in Shiraz;
    however, there are no further information regarding his arrest and
    detention. (E-from) Trial The trial took place at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz. There is no other information regarding
    this trial. (Kayhan newspaper) Charges Mr. Arshadi Buraki and six other
    men were collectively charged with armed robbery, terrorizing people and
    rape. (Kayhan Newspaper) The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Defense No information is
    available concerning Mr. Arshadi Buraki s defense. According to the
    e-form, Mr. Arshadi Buraki was innocent. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz sentenced Mr. Arshadi to death. The High
    Judicial Council confirmed the sentence. He was hanged in public after the
    Friday prayer of November 21, 1986, in a city in Fars Province. (Kayhan
