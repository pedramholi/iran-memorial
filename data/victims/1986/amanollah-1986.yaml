    The execution of Mr. Amanollah (last name unknown), son of Alinaz, was

    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Amanollah was charged with first-degree
    murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Amanollah’s defense. Judgment Branch 13 of the Penal Court of Shiraz
    sentenced Mr. Amanollah to death. The Supreme Court approved the sentence.
    He was executed at Adelabad prison in Shiraz.
