    details that after leaving Iran, Mr. Hamed Monfared was in contact with a
    number of officers of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army who were secretly
    working to overthrow the government (October 26, 1986). The National
    Movement of the Iranian Resistance The National Movement of the Iranian
    Resistance (also called the National Resistance Movement) is an
    organization opposed to the Islamic republic, established on August 5,
    1980, in Paris, France, by Shapur Bakhtiar, leader of the Iran Party and
    the last prime minister of the Monarchy. It was inspired by the National
    Resistance Movement that was established after the fall of Mohammad
    Mossadegh s government in 1953. Bakhtiar invited all nationalist groups
    and individuals to unite their forces around one political platform under
    the umbrella of the National Movement of the Iranian Resistance. In its
    National Movement of the Iranian Resistance Intellectual Principles and
    Political Platform , published on January 15, 1981, the National
    Resistance Movement announced its aim to be the establishment of democracy
    and a system based and predicated upon the free will of the people, so
    that citizens could be provided with the opportunity for a free, fruitful,
    and valuable life. The founder of the Movement insisted upon a pluralistic
    political structure, and considered intellectual and practical agreement
    with nationalism, democracy, and social justice as the necessary
    conditions for membership in the Movement. After its establishment, the
    Movement proposed a short-term and temporary plan consisting of four
    clauses: 1. The overthrow of the newly-established Islamic Republic of
    Iran; 2. Establishment of security through the creation of a coalition
    government composed of the nationalist opposition that shall have as its
    priority the realization of freedom and independence ; 3. The repair of an
    economy that is on the verge of bankruptcy during the dark rule [of
    theocracy] ; and 4. Establishment of a Constitutive Assembly, carrying out
    free elections, and turning over the country s affairs to the government
    chosen by the people s elected representatives**. In the early years of
    its activity, a wide array of Iranians both inside and outside Iran either
    joined or supported the National Resistance Movement. Among its principal
    activities were organizing the political and military arms of the Movement
    in various countries and in Iran; establishing contact with those opposed
    to the regime inside Iran and striving to organize them and to gather
    political and military intelligence; organizing assemblies and protests;
    disseminating Iran-related news, especially information regarding human
    rights violations and arbitrary executions inside and outside the country
    through publication of books and magazines (Nehzat weekly magazine and
    Qiam-e Iran weekly); establishment of radio broadcasts in various
    countries including Iraq and Egypt; conducting interviews with foreign an
