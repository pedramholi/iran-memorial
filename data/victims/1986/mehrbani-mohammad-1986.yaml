    Charges According to this report, Mr. Mehrbani was charged with
    first-degree murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Mehrbani’s defense. Judgment Qom’s Penal Court sentenced Mr. Mehrbani to
    death. The Supreme Judicial Council approved the sentence. Mr. Mohammad
    Mehrbani was hanged by the victim’s father in the Police station of Qom on
    January 28, 1986.
