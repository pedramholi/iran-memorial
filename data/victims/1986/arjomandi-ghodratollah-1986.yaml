    The information about Mr. Qodratollah Arjomandi is based on an interview

    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    Revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan
    Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly in the
    political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention The
