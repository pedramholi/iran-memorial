    The execution of Mr. Hezbion Purgiorkin, along with two others, was
    reported in the Kayhan Daily on December 3, 1986. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Purgiorkin s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial There is no information regarding this trial. Charges According to
    this report, Mr. Purgiorkin was charged with directing a drug-trafficking
    gang in Tehran, Hamedan and Mashad as well as importing drugs from
    Pakistan. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against the accused. Defense No information is
    available concerning Mr. Purgiorkin's defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Zahedan declared Mr. Purgiorgin a corruptor on
    earth and sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme
    Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out in the Anti-Narcotics
    Section of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
