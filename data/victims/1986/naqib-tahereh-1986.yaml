circumstances: >
    The execution of Ms. Tahereh Naqib, daughter of Jalil, along with
    co-defendant Mr. Bahman Karimi, was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on
    April 6, 1986. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known; but according to the available
    information, she served a three-month prison term before execution. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant’s trial, other than she was
    tried at the Penal Court of Qom. Charges According to the newspaper
    report, Ms. Naqib was charged with: “fornication” as a widower after her
    husband’s death, “conspiracy to commit murder” of her husband, and
    “adultery” as a married woman when her husband was alive. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Ms. Naqib’s defense. Judgment The Penal Court of Qom
    sentenced Ms. Naqib as follows: 100 lashes for “fornication” after her
    husband’s death, three months imprisonment for “conspiracy to commit
    murder” and execution by stoning for “adultery” as a married woman before
    her husband’s death. The Supreme Judicial Council approved the verdict.
    Ms. Naqib was flogged 100 lashes and served 3 months in prison. She was
    then stoned to death at 6:50 a.m. on April 6, 1986 in the presence of
    judiciary officials, military forces, the law enforcement forces and
    thousands of people beside the river near Qom. Mr. Karimi (co-defendant
    and charged with murder) was hanged the same morning.
