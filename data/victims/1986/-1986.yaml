    The execution of this unnamed defendant, along with three others, was
    reported in the Kayhan newspaper on February 25, 1986. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial,
    other than he was tried at the Penal Court of Shahrud (Semnan province).
    Charges According to this report, this unnamed defendant was charged with
    murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on this
    defendant’s defense. Judgment The Penal Court of Shahrud sentenced this
    person to death. The Supreme Court approved the sentence. He was executed
    in public.
