    When Mr. Talebi s family went to the Medical Examiner s Office, they
    noticed that instead of his corpse being in the mortuary, it had been
    wrapped in plastic and thrown in a corner. The Medical Examiner s
    justification was that an autopsy was not possible because the body had
    decomposed. The death certificate stated the cause of death as death by
    hanging. Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Babak
    Talebi, son of Davud and Rohanieh, was obtained from the Archives of Baha
    i Persecution in Iran webpage (date of visit: March 14, 2022); Asoo
    website (October 6, 2015); Baha i News (January 9, 2017); and the
    Secretariat of the Universal House of Justice, quoted from the Facebook
    social network, Golshan-e Eshq webpage (October 2, 2018). Mr. Babak Talebi
    is also one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999 report published
    by the Baha i International Community. The report, Iran s Secret Blueprint
    for the Destruction of a Religious Community , documents the persecutions
    of the members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the
    Baha is killed since 1978. Mr. Babak Talebi was born on December 11, 1969
    , in a Baha i family from the city of Karaj. He lived in the Sa idabad
    neighborhood, a Karaj suburb, where he also went to school. According to
    Baha i sources, Mr. Talebi s father was arrested in 1981 and spent three
    months in prison. After his father passed away of a heart attack in
    1985-86, Mr. Talebi had to take charge of the family. He had to quit
    school and start working. After changing several jobs, he went to the city
    of Shiraz in early 1986, in order to work at a relative s store. During
    this period, Mr. Talebi worked at the store during the day and spent the
    nights at his relative s home. He returned home to Tehran in mid-June of
    that same year to visit his family. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in
    Iran webpage, date of visit: March 14, 2022; Facebook social network,
    Golshan-e Eshgh webpage, October 2, 2018). The Baha is in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have
    subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the
    largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in
    1979 (1) - to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of
    their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized
    under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities
    refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the
    rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot
    profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence. (2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the
    time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified
    and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history
    of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the
    1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the
    country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since
    then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has
    so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases there has not been much published and
    the local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
    evidence, and traces obtained through investigations conducted by local
    police and judicial authorities confirm, however, the theory of state
    committed crimes. In certain cases, t
