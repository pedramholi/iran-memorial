circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Bahman Karimi, resident of Abadan and son of Mokhtar,
    along with co-defendant Ms. Tahereh Naqib, was reported in the Kayhan
    daily on April 6, 1986. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial, other than he was tried at the Penal
    Court of Qom. Charges According to the newspaper, Mr. Karimi was charged
    with “fornication” and “first-degree murder.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Karimi’s defense. Judgment The Penal Court f Qom
    sentenced Mr. Bahman Karimi to flogging (for “fornication”) and death (for
    murder). The Supreme Judicial Council approved the verdict. Mr. Karimi was
    flogged 100 lashes and was hanged on April 6, 1986 in Qom. He was 23 years
    old. Ms. Naqib (co-defendant and wife of the murdered man) was stoned to
    death the same morning.
