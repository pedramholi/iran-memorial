    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the

    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have

    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
