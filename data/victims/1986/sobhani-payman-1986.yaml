    At the time of Payman Sobhani's death, there was no designated burial site
    for Bah ' s in Saravan. Through the efforts of Peiman's mother, a plot of
    land was set aside for the burial of deceased Bah ' s. Payman Sobhani was
    the first Bah ' to be buried in the Bah ' cemetery in Saravan, known as
    "Golestan Javid". Information regarding the extrajudicial execution of Mr.
    Payman Sobhani, son of Ruh al-Amin and Tahereh Bi-Azar, was gathered from
    the Baha'i Persecution Documents website (April 28, 1986), IranWire (May
    15, 2022), Radio Zamaneh (August 27, 2013, and December 21, 2013), Aasoo
    (October 6, 2015), Baha'i News (January 9, 2017), Los Angeles Times (May
    14, 1986), and the blogs Khorafeh (May 16, 2020) and Shabahang (October
    17, 2022). Payman Sobhani (Azabadi) was born on March 13, 1971, to a Bah '
    family living in Sistan and Baluchestan. His family moved to the province
    when his father was 13 years old with the stated purpose of promoting the
    Bah ' Faith, and they remained there for 25 years. During this time, the
    Sobhani family ran a small cloth shop in the towns of Souran and Saravan
    in the same province. (Bah ' Persecution Documents website, April 28,
    1986; IranWire, May 15, 2022) Mr. Ruh al-Amin Sobhani, Payman's father,
    married Mrs. Tahereh Bi-Azar, a Bah ' from Yazd, while living in Souran.
    Some time later, Mrs. Bi-Azar moved to Souran to join her husband. Payman
    Sobhani was the family's fourth child. (IranWire, May 15, 2022) After
    living in Souran for several years, Payman's family moved to Saravan,
    another city in the same province. (IranWire, May 15, 2022) Following the
    tightening of restrictions on the Bah ' community, including the
    intensification of bans on education, Mr. Parviz Sobhani, another son of
    Mr. Ruh al-Amin Sobhani, traveled to Pakistan to continue his education
    and reside there temporarily until he could relocate to a third country.
    (IranWire, May 15, 2022) In 2008, the Bah ' International Community
    released the names of 221 Bah ' citizens who had been killed or executed
    in Iran over the previous three decades because of their religious
    beliefs. The youngest of these was Payman Sobhani Azabadi, a Bah '
    teenager from Saravan, Baluchestan, who had lived only 15 years.
    (IranWire, May 15, 2022) The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the
    members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious
    minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979*- to systematic
    harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human
    rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of
    the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As
    a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the
    status of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their
    faith, and are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law
    and in practice has subjected them to abuse and violence.** Persecution of
    Baha is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it
    was in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the
    Baha i threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national
    security in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Background
    of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic
    Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated violence in
    Iran and around the world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic
    operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in kidnapping,
    disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose activities
    they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial
    killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders began in
    February 1979 and have continued since then, both inside and outside Iran.
    The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings
    outside Iran attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have
    been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
    in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France,
    Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in
    Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases,
