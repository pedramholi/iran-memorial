    The execution of Mr. Bakhtiar Abdi, son of Sabz’ali, was reported in the
    Kayhan newspaper on March 11, 1986. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial, other than he was tried
    at Branch 6 of the Penal Court of Karaj. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Abdi was charged with first-degree murder. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Abdi’s defense. Judgment Branch 6 of the Penal Court of
    Karaj sentenced Mr. Bakhtiar Abdi to death. The Supreme Judicial Council
    approved the sentence. He was executed at Gezelhesar prison in the
    presence of the Public Prosecutor of Karaj.
