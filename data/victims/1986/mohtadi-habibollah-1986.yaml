    The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of
    the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious
    community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300
    thousand members in 1979 (1) to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history
    of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the
    1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the
    country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since
    then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has
    so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases there has not been much published and
    the local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
    evidence, and traces obtained through investigations conducted by local
    police and judicial authorities confirm, however, the theory of state
    committed crimes. In certain cases, these investigations have resulted in
    the expulsion or arrest of Iranian diplomats. In limited cases outside
    Iran, the perpetrators of these murders have been arrested and put on
    trial and the evidence presented, revealed the defendants connection to
    Ira
