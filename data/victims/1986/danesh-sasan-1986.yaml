    The information about Mr. Sasan Danesh (known in prison as Hassan
    Ebrahimzadeh) has been sent to Omid, via an electronic form, by a former
    cellmate. Mr. Danesh was born in Babol (Mazandaran province) and had
    educated siblings. After his mandatory military service, Mr. Danesh
    travelled to Chicago, IL, and started his political activities at the
    Confederation of Iranian Students, where he became familiar with leftist
    organization. In 1979, he returned to Iran and continued his activism at
    the Vahdat-e Komonisti Organization. The Vahdat-e Komonisti (Communist
    Unity) Organization was founded in November 1978 by Communist political
    activists, particularly students who were educated outside the country and
    returned to Iran, as well as similar-minded activists inside the country.
    The history of its founding dates back to the Ettehadieh Komonist-ha
    (Communist Union), which was formed outside Iran in the late 1960 s. The
    members of Vahdat-e Komonisti identified themselves as supporters of
    political-military struggle for the preparation and accomplishment of a
    Socialist revolution, and as leftists opposed to Stalinism and Maoism.
    Among the activities of this organization were critiques of the political
    and ideological standpoints of political organizations in Iran via
    publication of Raha i , the main publication of the Vahdat-e Komonisti.
    ِDuring the massive crackdown on opposition groups in June 1981, the
    organization faced significant crises and split into various factions.
    Members of the organization outside Iran continued their activism until
    1986 through the publication of Andisheh Raha i and Bultan-e Akhbar-e Iran
    (the Bulletin of Iranian News). Arrest and detention According to the
    available information, Mr. Danesh was arrested in Tehran on May 1, 1981,
    when he was returning home after having participated in a demonstration.
    He was carrying several political leaflets at the time of arrest. He was
    sent to Evin prison. In prison, he introduced himself as Hassan
    Ebrahimzadeh, and his cellmates called him Uncle Hassan. Trial According
    to his cellmate, Mr. Danesh was tried several times while the proceedings
    lasted only a few minutes. He was eventually condemned to 2 years
    imprisonment. He then was sent to Kohardasht prison (Karaj) and he was
    kept in solitary confinement for 2 years. In 1986 he was tried again; the
    trial lasted ten minutes. Charges Mr. Danesh was charged with defending
    Marxism and apostasy. Evidence of guilt At the time of arrest, Mr. Danesh
    was carring political leaflets. He also defended Marxism in prison and at
    trials. No further information is available on the evidence provided
