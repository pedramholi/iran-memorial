circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Akbar Samareh Namdarjavan, along with four others,
    was reported in the Kayhan Daily on November 26, 1986. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Samareh Namdarjavan s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial There is no information regarding this
    trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Samareh Namdarjavan was
    charged with being the head of a drug-trafficking gang and large-scale
    drug distribution in northern Tehran, Qazvin, Zanjan and Sirjan as well as
    importing drugs from Pakistan. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Samareh Namdarjavan s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Zahedan declared Mr.
    Samareh Namdarjavan a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death.
    Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was
    carried out in the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s
    Office in the afternoon.
