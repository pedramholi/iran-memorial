    The execution of Mr. Asghar Abolverdi, along with another defendant, was
    reported in the Kayhan daily on March 2, 1986. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Abolverdi was charged with both “the
    first-degree murder of Safar Keshavarz and burning his corpse.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Abolverdi's defense. Judgment The 14th
    branch of Shiraz’s Penal Court I sentenced Mr. Abolverdi to death. Having
    been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in
    public.
