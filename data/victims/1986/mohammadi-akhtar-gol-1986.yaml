    The execution of Ms. Akhtar Gol Mohammadi, along with four others, was
    reported in the Kayhan Daily on March 13, 1986. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Ms. Gol Mohammadi s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial There is no information regarding this trial. Charges According to
    this report, Ms. Gol Mohammadi was charged with drug dealing in various
    cities of Iran. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against the accused. Defense No information is
    available concerning Ms. Gol Mohammadi's defense. Judgment Ms. Gol
    Mohammadi was sentenced to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme
    Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out in the presence of the
    prisoners in prison at dawn. There is no information regarding the
    tribunal that issued the death sentence.
