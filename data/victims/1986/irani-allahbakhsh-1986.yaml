    The execution of Mr. Allahbakhsh Irani was reported in the Kayhan daily on
    May 13, 1986. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Irani was
    charged with murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Irani’s defense. Judgment Branch One of the Penal Court of Ardebil
    sentenced Mr. Allahbakhsh Irani to death. The Supreme Court approved this
    verdict. Mr. Irani was hanged at dawn of May 12, 1986 at the police
    station in Meshkin Shahr (today in Ardabil province). He was 21 years old.
