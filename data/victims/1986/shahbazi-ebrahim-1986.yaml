    The execution of Mr. Ebrahim Shahbazi was reported in the Kayhan daily on
    April 19, 1986. The Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor of Karaj told the
    Kayhan reporter that 22 individuals, including 6 women and 16 men, had
    been arrested regarding the same case, and that the High Judicial Court
    had approved the execution sentence by stoning of some of them. He said
    that these persons would be stoned to death in the future. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Shahbazi was charged with “adultery,
    establishing a prostitution gang and turning his pastry shop to a place
    for adultery.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Shahbazi’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Karaj
    sentenced Mr. Shahbazi to death by stoning. The Supreme Court of the
    Supreme Judicial Council approved the sentence. According to the
    newspaper, the head of the Clergy Association of Karaj, delivered a
    detailed speech on the divine commandments in the Quran. Mr. Ebrahim
    Shahbazi was stoned to death in public.
