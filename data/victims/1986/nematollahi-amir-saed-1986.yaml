    The information regarding the execution of Mr. Amir Sa ed Ne matollahi,
    son of Mohammad Mohsen, was sent to the Boroumand Foundation via an
    electronic form by a person informed about this case. According to this
    information, Mr. Ne matollahi was born in Malayer in 1950. He was an
    electrical engineer, a graduate of Sharif University, and worked at a
    utility company in Bandar Abbas. He was married and had a ten-month-old
    son at the time of his arrest. His older brother (Mas ud Ne matollahi) was
    executed two and half years before him in 1984. Mr. Ne matollahi and his
    brother were sympathizers of the Iranian Fighting Workers Organization, a
    faction that had split from the Tufan Organization. The person who sent
    the electronic form remembers Mr. Ne matollahi as a kind, honest, and
    honorable man. The Marxist-Leninist Organization of Tufan was founded in
    the late 1960s. De-Stalinization policy of Khoroshev in the Soviet Union
    led to a political crisis in Iranian communist party Tudeh, as in many
    communist parties around the world. Three Tudeh leaders i.e. Forutan,
    Qasemi Saqa i left the Party in 1963 to found the Revolutionary
    Organization of the Tudeh Party and then the Marxist-Leninist Organization
    of Tufan . The organization changed its name after the 1979 revolution and
    first became The Party of workers and farmers of Iran and later on Iran
    Work Party, Tufan. The Party believed in a one-party system and supported
    a political system modeled after Albania, which it considered as the only
    socialist countries. The Organization of Struggling Workers of Iran is a
    split from Tufan founded by some of the party s personnel. Arrest and
    detention According to the information sent by the electronic form, Mr. Ne
    matollahi was arrested in Bandar Abbas in December of 1982 (three months
    after the arrest of his brother Mas ud). After three or four days, he was
    transferred to Ward 209 of the Evin Prison. He was denied any visitation
    for three months, but later, he was allowed monthly visitations. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Ne matollahi s trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Ne matollahi are unknown. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against Mr. Ne matollahi cannot be ascertained in the absence of
    the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Ne matollahi s defense. He was denied the right to an attorney.
    Judgment According to the information provided by the electronic form, Mr.
    Ne matollahi was hanged in the Evin prison on August 5, 1986. His family
    was not allowed to see him one last time before his execution. After Mr.
    Ne matollahi was executed, the authorities contacted his family telling
    them to call the Prison. When his family called the Prison they were told
    to go to Evin and collect his clothes. Mr. Ne matollahi did not leave a
    will and the location of his grave is not known.
