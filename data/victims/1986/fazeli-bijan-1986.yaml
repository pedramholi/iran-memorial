    Bijan Fazeli was 22 years old. He was a senior at London University,
    studying computers. He was a sportsman, had a black belt in karate, and
    his friends used to call him invincible . Information regarding the life
    and the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Bijan Fazeli, son of Reza, was
    collected from Washington Post website (August 21, 1986; New York Times
    (August 21, 1986), Daily Telegraph (August 22 and 28, 1986), Observer
    (August 24, 1986), and Times newspapers; a letter from Mr. Reza Fazeli to
    New York Times Newspaper (August 23 and September 2, 1986); and an
    interview given by Mr. Reza Fazeli to Pars Television (July 2007).
    According to available information, Mr. Fazeli was 22, single, and a
    senior at London University, studying computers. He was a sportsman, he
    was a black belt in karate, and his friends called him invincible . He
    worked at his father s arts and crafts store (KVC Video and Bookstore) on
    Kensington Avenue. His father, Reza Fazeli, had a degree in Philosophy of
    Religion, and he was known in Iran as an actor, director, and producer. He
    went to England as a refugee in 1979. During the 1980s, through his UK
    based production company, he produced over 50 documentaries. He was a
    nationalist political activist and he wrote against the Islamic Republic
    Government. He had produced a series of films Akhund Variety Show , a
    satire in which actors dressed as religious figures and familiar
    government officials criticize the Islamic government. According to one of
    his friends, Reza s store in London, in which he sold videos and books,
    gradually became a cultural center and a gathering place for Iranian
    writers and artists living in London (Nourizad). Background of
    Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic
    Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated violence in
    Iran and around the world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic
    operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in kidnapping,
    disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose activities
    they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial
    killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders began in
    February 1979 and have continued since then, both inside and outside Iran.
    The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings
    outside Iran attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have
    been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
    in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France,
    Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in
    Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases
    there has not been much published and the local authorities have not
    issued arrest warrants. But documentation, evidence, and traces obtained
    through investigations conducted by local police and judicial authorities
    confirm, however, the theory of state committed crimes. In certain cases,
    these investigations have resulted in the expulsion or arrest of Iranian
    diplomats. In limited cases outside Iran, the perpetrators of these
    murders have been arrested and put on trial and the evidence presented,
    revealed the defendants connection to Iran s government institutions, and
    an arrest warrant has been issued for Iran s Minister of Information. The
    manner in which these killings were organized and implemented in Iran and
    abroad, is indicative of a single pattern which, according to Roland
    Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor, contains common parameters and detailed
    planning. It can be ascertained from the similarities between these
    murders in different countries that the Iranian government is the
    principal entity who ordered the implementation of these crimes. Iranian
    authorities have not officially accepted responsibility for these murders
    and have even attributed their commission to internal strife in opposition
    groups. Nevertheless, since the very inception of the Islamic Republic
    regime, the Islamic Republic officials have justified these crimes from an
    ideological and legal standpoint. In the spring of 1979, Sadeq Khalkhali,
    the first Chief Shari a Judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts,
    officially announced the regime s decision to implement extrajudicial
    executions, and justified the decision: These people have been sentenced
    to death; from the Iranian people s perspective, if someone wants to
    assassinate these individuals abroad, in any country, no government has
    any right to bring the perpetrator to trial as a terrorist, because such a
    person is the implementing agent of the sentence issued by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court. Therefore, they are Mahduroddam and their sentence is
    death regardless of where they are. More than 10 years after these
    proclamations, in a speech about the security forces success, Ali
    Fallahian, the regime s Minister of Information stated the following
