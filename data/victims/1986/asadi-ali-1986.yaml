circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ali Asadi, son of Ali Reza, along with three others,
    was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on February 25, 1986. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the trial other than Mr.
    Asadi was tried at the Penal Court of Qom. Charges According to this
    report, Mr. Asadi was charged with murder. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Asadi’s defense. Judgment The Penal Court of Qom
    sentenced Mr. Asadi to death. The Supreme Court and the Supreme Judicial
    Council approved the sentence. He was hanged in a police department in Qom
    by the victim’s next of kin (avengers of blood) in the presence of the
    judicial officials and the law enforcement forces in the morning of
    February 25, 1986.
