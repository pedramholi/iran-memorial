    Mr. Mehdinejad was born in 1937, to a Baha i father and a Muslim mother.
    He chose to believe in the Baha i Faith. In the early days of the Islamic
    Revolution, he was fired from his job for being a Baha i. Information
    about the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Iraj Mehdinejad (also spelled "
    Mehdi Nezhad") has been collected from the website of the Archives of Baha
    i Persecution in Iran (July 18, 1983; September 4, 1986). Mr. Mehdinejad
    was born in 1937, to a Baha i father and a Muslim mother. He chose to
    believe in the Baha i Faith. Mr. Mehdinejad worked for the General
    Department of Housing and Urban Development of Hormozgan Province. In his
    workplace, he was under pressure for his religious beliefs. In the early
    days of the Islamic Revolution, he was fired from his job for being a Baha
    i (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran Website, September 4, 1986; July
    18, 1983). According to a document published by the Archives of Baha i
    Persecution in Iran, on July 18, 1983, the Housing and Urban Development
    Ministry sent a memorandum to the General Department of Housing and Urban
    Development of Hormozgan Province, asking Mr. Mehdinejad to change his
    religion. In this memorandum, titled Memorandum to Iraj Mehdinejad,
    regarding clarification of his religion , it says Whereas according to the
    law, government employees of the Islamic Republic of Iran are required to
    adhere to one of the formally recognized religions of the country, and
    since your hiring file does not show the least trace of such belief, you
    are hereby required to clearly declare your religion to this commission,
    within ten days of the issuance of this memorandum. It should be noted
    that if an answer is not received in time, this file will be examined in
    absentia, and you will be dealt with according to the appropriate
    guidelines. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran Website, July 18,
    1983) The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979 (1) - to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence. (2) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the
    Baha i threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national
    security in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Background
    of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic
    Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated violence in
    Iran and around the world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic
    operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in kidnapping,
    disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose activities
    they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial
    killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders began in
    February 1979 and have continued since then, both inside and outside Iran.
    The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings
    outside Iran attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have
    been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
    in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France,
    Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in
    Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases
    there has not been much published and the local authorities have not
    issued arrest warrants. But documentation, evidence, and traces obtained
    through investigations conducted by local police and judicial authorities
    confirm, however, the theory of state committed crimes. In certain cases,
    these investigations have resulted in the expulsion or arrest of Iranian
    diplomats. In limited ca
