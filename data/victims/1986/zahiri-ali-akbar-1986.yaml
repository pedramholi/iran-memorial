    The execution of Mr. Akbar Zahiri was reported in the Kayhan daily on
    March 4, 1986. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Zahiri was
    charged with murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Zahiri's defense. Judgment Mr. Zahiri was sentenced to death. No
    information is available about the court which issued the death sentence.
    After being confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence (Qesas or law of
    Talion) was carried out in front of the victim’s next of kin (avengers of
    blood) at Bakhtaran’s Dizelabad prison.
