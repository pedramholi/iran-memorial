circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Gholam Reza Khungah, along with three others, was
    reported in the Kayhan newspaper on February 25, 1986. Arrest and
    detention According to the newspaper, Mr. Khungah was arrested in Behshahr
    (Mazandaran province). Trial No information is available on the trial,
    other than Mr. Khungah was tried at the Penal Court of Shahrud (Semnan
    province). Charges According to this report, Mr. Khungah was charged with
    murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to this report,
    Mr. Khungah “confessed to the murder of his wife and her brother during
    the interrogation.” International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Khungah’s defense. Judgment The Penal
    Court of Shahrud sentenced Mr. Khungah to death. The Supreme Court
    approved the sentence. He was hanged in public in Torbat-e Heydarieh
    (Khorasan province) by the victims’ next of kin (avengers of blood).
