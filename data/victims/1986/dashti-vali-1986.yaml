    The execution of Mr. Vali Dashti was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on
    April 6, 1986. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges According to the newspaper, Mr. Dashti was
    charged with the rape and murder of a three-year-old girl. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Dashti’s defense. Judgment Mr. Dashti was tried and
    sentenced to death. He was hanged in public at the sports stadium in
    Qaemshahr (Mazandaran province).
