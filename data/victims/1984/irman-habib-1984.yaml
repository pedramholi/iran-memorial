    The execution of Mr. Habib Irman, along with 24 others, was announced in a
    communiqué by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor’s
    Office. The communiqué was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on April
    9, 1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are unknown. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges According to this communiqué, Mr. Irman was
    charged with “being actively involved in the supply and distribution of
    heroin, selling packages containing 5 g of heroin for 2 years,
    establishing narcotics dens, and establishing a drug-trafficking gang.”
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown Evidence of guilt
    According to this report Mr. Irman had “prior convictions for supplying
    and distributing heroin.” Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Irman’s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal sentenced Mr. Irman to death. After being confirmed by the
    Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out at dawn.
