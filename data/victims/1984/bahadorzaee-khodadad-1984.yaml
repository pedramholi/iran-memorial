    The execution of Mr. Khodadad Bahadorzaee, along with two others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on October 21, 1984. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Bahadorzaee was charged with being
    involved in drug distribution. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Bahadorzaee s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Ferdos and Tabas declared Mr. Bahadorzaee a corruptor on earth as well as
    a destroyer of the generation and sentenced him to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out.
