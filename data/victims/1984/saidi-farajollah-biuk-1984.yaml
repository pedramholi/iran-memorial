    The information about Mr. Farajollah (Biuk) Sa'idi is taken from the book
    Our Martyrs in the Path to Freedom , copyright 1988 by Rah-e Kargar
    publications. He was born in Tabriz. He studied at the Tehran Science and
    Technology University. During the previous regime, in 1975, he was
    arrested and detained for being a sympathizer of the Fedayian Khalq
    Organization. In 1978, he was released and joined the Peykar Organization.
    Later he joined the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran-Rah-e
    Kargar. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran"
    was established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They called themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Sa'idi was arrested in his home on
    February 8, 1982. According to the book, he was able to conceal his
    identity from his captors for nine months, but a fellow prison revealed
    his identity to the authorities and he was severely tortured after that.

    sad for me. Get married after I am gone…. My son, try to be honourable and
    enjoy your life…"
