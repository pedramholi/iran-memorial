    The execution of Mr. Dorangol Paktiani, along with thirteen others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 8, 1984. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Paktiani was charged with being actively
    involved in supplying and distributing narcotics as well as distributing 2
    kg of heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Paktiani s defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Zahedan declared Mr. Paktiani a
    corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by
    the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out at night.
