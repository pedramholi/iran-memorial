    Information about Mr. Ali Kasra’i Kelestani, born in 1942, son of Hemmat,
    has been drawn from an interview with an individual familiar with this
    case. He resided in Kelestan village, located on the road to Shiraz
    between Ardekan (to the north) and Guyom (to the south). According to the
    interviewee, residents of Kelestan were well-known for being
    counter-revolutionary, and pro-monarchy. This caused acrimony with the
    government; and thus, the village was not developed. The residents of
    Kelestan, without government help, brought water to the village through a
    subterranean canal. According to the same source, many other residents of
    Kelestan were executed by the government. The interviewee remembers Mr.
    Kasra’i as a kind and well-respected man. Arrest and detention According
    to the interviewee, Mr. Kasra’i had been wanted for a long time. At the
    time of his arreste, his house was ambushed and even his wife was
    battered. He was taken to Gezelhesar prison (in Tehran). His family
    members had tribal traditions and would go to visit him in groups. But
    they were harassed and denied visitation. Trial There is no information
