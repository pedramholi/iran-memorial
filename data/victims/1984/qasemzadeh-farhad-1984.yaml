    of heroin and selling 1.100 kg of it and dealing 300 gm as well as 800 gm
    of heroin at two different times. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Qasemzadeh s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal sentenced Mr. Qasemzadeh to death. The sentence was carried out
    at dawn.
