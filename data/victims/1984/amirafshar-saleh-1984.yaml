    Information about Mr. Saleh Amirafshar is based on an electronic form sent
    to Omid by a person familiar with his case, by way of a cellmate, and the
    website of the Tudeh Party of Iran. According to this information, he was
    born in Khuzestan on January 7, 1954. He was an Arab-Iranian who worked at
    the National Oil Company in Ahvaz and was a sympathizer of the Tudeh Party
    of Iran. He began his political activities before the revolution and
    played an effective role in organizing the party in the petroleum industry
    after the revolution. During the Iran-Iraq war, he was at the front lines
    for nine months. He became a member of the Petroleum Committee in Ahvaz
    and then a member of the City Committee for the party. He wrote many
    articles regarding the condition of workers in the petroleum industry. The
    Tudeh Party of Iran ( Hezbe Tudeh or the Party of the Masses) was founded
    in 1941 by a group of mostly communist intellectuals. Its non-radical
    reformist platform and its name reflected the founders hopes to attract
    the larger religious population. However, the Party's Marxist-Leninist
    orientation and its anti-Imperialist and anti-Fascist positions made it
    most influential among intellectuals and educated Iranians. In the late
    1940s and early 50s, The Tudeh , with its country-wide organization,
    including active women, youth, and labor groups, as well as a secret
    military network ( Sazman-e Nezami-ye Hezb-e Tudeh Iran ), played a major
    role in Iran s political scene. The Tudeh was banned following an
    attempted assassination against the Shah in 1949. Nonetheless, the Party
    continued its activities as well as its publications, of which there would
    be many. Following the August 19, 1953, coup, the Tudeh s military network
    was annihilated and many of its leaders arrested or forced into exile,
    mostly in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Over the years, the Party s
    political influence diminished, due to the various splits resulting from
    its pro-Soviet stand and policies in periods of political tension in Iran
    and from the radicalization of the left in the 1960s and 1970s. After the
    1979 Revolution, the Tudeh declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic
    Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively
    supported and collaborated with the government. Though the Party never
    opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of its attacks in 1982,
    and the Party's leaders and many members, including those of the new
    secret military network, were arrested. The Tudeh lost scores of its
    members during the mass prison killing of 1988. Following several splits,
    the Party resumed its activities in the early 1990s in exile. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Saleh Amirafshar s arrest and detention
    are not known. According to the information sent to Omid , he was arrested
    in Ahvaz in 1982. According to the website of the Tudeh Party of Iran,
    however, he was arrested at his work location in May of 1983 and was
    tortured severely until his execution. His resistance resulted in his
    transfer to solitary confinement. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Saleh Amirafshar s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Saleh
    Amirafshar s charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Amirafshar. Defense No information is available about Mr. Saleh Amirafshar
    s defense. According to the website of the Tudeh Party of Iran,
    interrogators asked Mr. Amirafshar to confess, but he resisted and
    defended his political party. Judgment No specific information is
    available about Mr. Saleh Amirafshar s execution. According to the
    information sent to Omid , he was executed in Ahvaz in 1984.
