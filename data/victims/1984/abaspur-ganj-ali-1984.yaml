    Mr. Ganj Ali Abaspur (The Democratic Party of Iranian Kordestan) is one of
    the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kordestan (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with the objective to gain
    autonomy for Kurdistan, in north-west of Iran. After the Revolution,
    conflicts between the new central Shiite government and the mainly Sunni
    Kurdistan, regarding the role of minorities in the drafting of the
    constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and
    particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in armed clashes between
    the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The
    PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, when people went to polls to
    vote for or against the Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979 Ayatollah
    Khomeini called the PDKI the “party of Satan” and declared it “unofficial
    and illegal.” Mass executions and fighting broke out and continued for
    several months in the region. By 1983, PDKI had lost much of its influence
    in the region. Various leaders of the PDKI have been assassinated. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of Mr. Abaspur’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Abaspur’s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Abaspur is not known. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Abaspur’s defense. Judgment There is no information on
    the verdict leading to this execution.
