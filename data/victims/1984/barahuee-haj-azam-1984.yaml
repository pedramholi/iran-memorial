    The execution of Mr. Haj Azam Barahuee, along with five others, was
    announced by the public relations of the Islamic Revolution s Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Mashad and reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on
    April 23, 1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Barahuee was
    charged with possessing 30 sacks of opium and distributing 36 sacks of
    opium. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Barahuee s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Mashad sentenced Mr. Barahuee to death. Having been confirmed
    by the Islamic Revolution s Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
