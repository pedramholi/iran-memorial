    Mr. Abolfazl Bahrami Nejad is among the 282 individuals listed in a United
    Nations Report on The Situation of Human Right in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran (Note by the Secretary General), published on November 13, 1985. The
    report lists these individuals as "Persons Allegedly Summarily and
    Arbitrarily Executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran: 1984-1985." The
    additional information about Mr. Bahrami Nejad is taken from the book The
    Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001 by The Tudeh Party of Iran Publications. He
    was born in Ardebil. He was a student at the Technical University of
    Tehran and an employee of the Computers Office of the Army. After the
    Revolution, he joined the Tudeh Party and worked in a very sensitive
    position in the party’s Secret Organization. The Tudeh Party of Iran was
    created in 1941. The Tudeh's ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it
    supported the former Soviet Union's policies. The Party played a major
    role on Iran's political scene until it was banned following the August
    19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh actively supported the
    Ayatollah Khomeini and his Islamic Republic. Although the Party never
    opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of government attacks
    from 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are unknown. Mr. Bahrami Nejad was arrested in Tehran in May
    1983. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    No information is available on Mr. Bahrami Nejad’s charges. The Tudeh
    Martyrs book quotes Mr. Bahrami Nejad’s cellmate’s assertion that one of
    the charges against him was his authorship of a book called “A Research on
    Nature and Metaphysics.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available about the defendant’s defence. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the defendant’s execution
    sentence. Mr. Bahrami Nejad was executed by a firing squad in the
    Jamshidieh Garrison in Tehran on February 26, 1984. He was executed by a
    firing squad along with his cousin, Mohammad Bahrami Nejad, and eight
    others who were high ranking members of the military group of the Tudeh
    Party.
