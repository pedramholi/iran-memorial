    The execution of Mr. Gholam Reza Zaboli Kashiti, along with seven others,
    was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on November 15, 1984. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Zaboli Kashiti was charged with
    organizing a drug- distribution gang, having contacts with armed smugglers
    and collaborating with them, buying, selling and storing 3647 kg of burnt
    opium as well as 1006 gm of heroin. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Zaboli
    Kashiti s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman
    sentenced Mr. Zaboli Kashiti to death. Having been confirmed by the
    Islamic Revolution s Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in the
    prison of Kerman Police Headquarters at dawn.
