circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ali Asghar Geranpayeh, along with two others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on May 21, 1984. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Geranpayeh was charged with dealing 1.388 kg
    of heroin several times, threatening people with a cold weapon,
    transporting illegal passengers across the border, importing narcotics
    from Zahedan to Bandar Abbas for sale and distribution as well as being in
    drug business for 7 years. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Geranpayeh s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Hormozgan sentenced Mr. Geranpayeh to death. Having been confirmed by the
    Supreme Judicial Court, the sentence was carried out.
