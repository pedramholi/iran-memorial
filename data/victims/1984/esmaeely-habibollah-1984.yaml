    The execution of Mr. Habibollah Esmaeely, along with 6 others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 21, 1984. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Esmaeely was charged with being
    consistently involved in dealing opium and heroin, transporting and
    storing more than 8.5 kg of opium at 3 different times, storing a weapon
    and some unauthorized cartridges, using opium and alcoholic drinks and
    evading the police. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Esmaeely
    s defense. Judgment The Army Revolutionary Tribunal in Kerman sentenced
    Mr. Esmaeely to death. Having been confirmed by the Islamic Revolution s
    Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
