    Mr. Mahmud Bozorgmehr, a father of one, is one of the 12028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Additional information about Mr.
    Bozorgmehr is gathered from a book titled Siavoshan: Remembrance of the
    Ranjbaran Party of Iran’s Martyrs by Baqer Mortazavi, 1999, Germany. Mr.
    Bozorgmehr went to France many years before the 1979 Revolution. He became
    a member of the Student Confederation Board in 1969. He returned to Iran
    in 1978. He was one of the founders of the Ranjbaran Party in 1979. The
    Confederation of Iranian Students, National Union, (CISNU) was the outcome
    of a 1962 merger of Iranian students’ associations formed two years
    earlier in Europe and the United States with the aim of promoting
    cooperation, strengthening students groups, and informing them of their
    rights and obligations. The Confederation was composed mainly of members
    or sympathizers of the National Front and the Tudeh. During the first
    years of its activities, the organization’s leadership was dominated by
    the National Front supporters. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Confederation
    became a significant opposition force outside Iran, bringing media
    visibility to political prisoners and repression in Iran. In 1971, the
    Iranian government declared the CISNU illegal. The Confederation
    radicalized progressively and by the mid-1970s, it was dominated by
    pro-guerrilla student organizations. Its new Charter (1975) explicitly
    called for the overthrow of the Shah’s regime. After the Islamic
    Revolution most of its members returned to Iran. The Ranjbaran Party of
    Iran was established, in Tehran, by a number of Marxist groups and parties
    in late December 1979. The founders of Ranjbaran were Marxist – Leninist
    and followers of Mao Tse-Tung’s school of thought. They opposed the USA
    and the USSR and supported Ruhollah Khomeini as an anti-imperialist
    leader. During the massive repression of 1981, the party was banned and
    its leaders were executed. Its publication, Ranjbar , is occasionally
    published outside Iran since 1981. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown. He was arrested in
    the early 1980s, though the exact date is unknown. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on
    Mr. Bozorgmehr’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Bozorgmehr’s defense. Judgment No
    information is available on the verdict leading to this execution. Mr.
    Mahmud Bozorgmehr executed by a firing squad in Tehran on July 15, 1984.
