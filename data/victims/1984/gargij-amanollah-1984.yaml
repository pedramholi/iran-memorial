    The execution of Mr. Amanollah Gargij, along with 6 others, was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 21, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Gargij was charged with being consistently
    involved in dealing and transporting narcotics as well as intending to
    sell 1400 kg of opium and 150 kg of heroin to officers. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Gargij s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Esfahan sentenced
    Mr. Gargij to death. Having been confirmed by the Islamic Revolution s
    Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
