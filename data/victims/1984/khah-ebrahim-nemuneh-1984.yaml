    Mr. Ebrahim Nemuneh Khah is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were either executed or
    killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June
    20, 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Nemuneh Khah is also
    among the 282 individuals listed in a United Nations Report on The
    Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Note by the
    Secretary General), published on 13 November 1985. The report lists these
    individuals as "Persons who were allegedly summarily and arbitrarily
    executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran: 1984-1985." Supplemental
    information about Mr. Nemuneh Khah has been sent to the Boroumand
    Foundation, via two electronic forms, by individuals familiar with this
    case. According to this information, Mr. Nemuneh Khah, son of Asadollah,
    was born in Tabriz in 1957. He had six brothers and one sister. Two of his
    brothers, Mehdi Nemuneh Khah and Asghar Nemuneh Khah, and his
    sister-in-law, Ms. A zamossadat Ghaffarpur Musavi, were also killed by the
    Islamic Regime. Mr. Nemuneh Khah was an electrical and electronics
    engineering student and a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention According to the information sent by one
    of electronic forms, Mr. Nemuneh Khah was arrested by plain-clothes agents
    at Shahnaz intersection in Tabriz on June 20, 1981 at 6 p.m. He was beaten
    during the arrest and transferred to the Revolution Prison in Tabriz,
    where he was continuously interrogated and tortured for two months. The
    sender of the electronic form believes that he was tortured to coerce
    confessions. Trial According to the information in the electronic form,
    Mr. Nemuneh Khah was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz in
    the summer of 1981. His trial lasted only for couple of minuets. Charges
    According to the information in the electronic form, the initial charge
    against Mr. Nemuneh Khah was membership of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. However, after three years imprisonment, he was retried
    under the new charge of creating an organization inside the prison. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt There is no information on the evidence presented
    against the defendant. Defense Based on the information in the electronic
    form, Mr. Nemuneh Khah was denied the right to have access to an attorney.
    Judgment According to one of the electronic forms, Mr. Nemuneh Khah was
    first condemned to life imprisonment by the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Tabriz. However, in his second trial, he was condemned to death, along
    with eight other prisoners that were members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization. Mr. Nemuneh Khah was executed by a firing squad on a
    religious holiday, Aide Ghadir, on Friday September 14, 1984 at dawn. The
    data in the addendum to the Mojahed magazine matches this information.
