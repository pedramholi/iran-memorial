circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Seyed Yahya Hosseiny, along with 24 others, was
    announced in a communiqu from the public relations office of the
    Anti-Narcotics Section of Tehran s Public Prosecutor s Office. The
    communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami Daily on December 9, 1984.
    The communiqu stated: " The Anti-Narcotics Section of Tehran s Public
    Prosecutor s Office declared 25 international professional drug
    traffickers corruptors on earth and issued a firm and revolutionary death
    sentence against them. These sentences were issued following the repeated
    warnings by the Public Prosecutor s Office to the drug smugglers- these
    death dealers and partisans of estekbar-e jahani (the universal arrogance)
    to repent from their hideous acts and return to the humane, Islamic
    society of Iran. Moreover, the Hezbollah Ummah (community) had recurrently
    asked the Islamic Revolution s Tribunals for severe punishment of these
    persons who consciously corrupted the young in this country." Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to this communiqu , Mr. Hosseiny was charged with
    establishing an international drug-trafficking gang, possessing 5.408 kg
    of heroin and 6.332 kg of opium when arrested, selling 35 kg of heroin,
    making contacts with Afghans to supply heroin, having a previous criminal
    record for supplying, distributing and transporting drugs, supplying 30 kg
    of heroin and transporting it to Mashad. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hosseiny
    s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    declared Mr. Hosseiny a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death.
    Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Court, the sentence was
    carried out in prison at dawn.
