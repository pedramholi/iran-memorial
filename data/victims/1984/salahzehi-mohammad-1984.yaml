    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Salahzehi was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on February 28, 1984. The newspaper specifies that Mr. Salahzehi was
    “a member of the anti-revolutionary gang of mercenary thugs.” There is no
    mention of the name of the group. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to
    the report, Mr. Salahzehi was charged with “participation in taking
    passer-bys as hostages and extorting money from them, participation in
    armed hostage taking conducted by thugs, martyring Private Mehraban and
    his company, armed robbery and plundering, as well as close collaboration
    with the leaders of mercenary thugs.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Salahzehi's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Zahedan sentenced Mohammad Salahzehi to death. After being confirmed by
    the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out in public in
    the town of Iranshahr.
