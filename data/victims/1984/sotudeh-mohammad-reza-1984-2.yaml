    Mr. Mohammad Reza Sotudeh is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The following information is based on an interview
    with relatives of Mr. Mohammad Reza Sotudeh. Mr. Sotudeh was an active
    member of the Fadayian Khalq Organization. He was imprisoned twice during
    the previous regime. First time, 1970-1974, for his activities in the
    Student Confederation and the second time, in 1975, he was condemned to
    life in prison. During the revolution, in February 1979, he was released.
    According to his relatives, he was determined not to be easily captured by
    the Islamic Republic agents. He would say: “We should not give up like
    timid sheep.” Thus, immediately after being arrested on Karaj freeway, he
    attempted to escape. Only after he was shot twice, was he caught and taken
    into custody. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerrilla movements of
    Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic
    Republic and was active mainly in the political arena and the labor
    movement. Arrest and detention Mr. Sotudeh was arrested during a search
    and control operation by the police on Karaj freeway on July 19, 1983. He
    was detained in section 209 of the Evin prison. He was denied the right to
    have an attorney and had only one visit by his two brothers during his
    fourteen-month detention. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Sotudeh's
    charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Sotudeh's defense. Judgment Mr. Sotudeh was executed in
    Evin prison on September 18, 1984. According to the interviewee, the night
    before his execution he spoke with his sister-in-law asking about the well
    being of his wife and children. When his sister-in-law was informed of the
    execution judgment, she cried. But, Mr. Sotudeh tried to calm her down.
