    The execution of Mr. Hossein Solat Ali, along with 24 others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotics
    Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was

    possessing 457 gm of heroin when arrested, having a criminal record for
    supplying and distributing narcotics, dealing 1 kg of heroin once, dealing
    packages containing 100 gm and 500 gm of heroin, being actively involved
    in supplying and distributing heroin and severe addiction. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Solat
    Ali s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    declared Mr. Solat Ali a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death.
    The sentence was carried out in prison at dawn.
