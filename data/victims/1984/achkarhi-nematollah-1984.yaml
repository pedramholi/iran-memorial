    The execution of Mr. Ne matollah Achkarhi, along with six others, was

    Charges According to this report, Mr. Achkarhi was charged with importing
    5 kg of heroin for distribution. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Achkarhi
    s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Zahedan declared
    Mr. Achkarhi a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
