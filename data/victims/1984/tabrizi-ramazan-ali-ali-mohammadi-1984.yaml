    The execution of Mr. Ramezan Ali Alimohammadi Tabrizi, along with 21
    others, was announced in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the
    Public Prosecutor s Office. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on March 11, 1984. The communiqu states: the Anti-Narcotics
    Section of the Islamic Revolution s Public Prosecutor s Office sentenced
    22 professional traffickers who were mercenaries and servants of
    foreigners. These firm and revolutionary sentences were issued in reply to
    the calling of the valiant people that scream with all of their hearts:
    Fight, fight, fight until victory! and in defiance of our second war
    imposed by the estekbar-e jahani (Universal Arrogance). Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to the report, Mr. Alimohammadi Tabrizi was charged with
    being consistently and actively involved in supplying and distributing
    heroin, possessing 121.75 centigram of heroin when arrested, buying 880 gm
    of heroin in Mashad and selling it in Tehran, dealing 730 gm of heroin as
    well as having a criminal record for supplying and distributing heroin.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Alimohammadi Tabrizi s defense. Judgment The
    Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Alimohammadi
    Tabrizi to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence
    was carried out in Qasr prison at dawn.
