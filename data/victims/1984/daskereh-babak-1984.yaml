    The information about Mr. Babak Daskereh (Dastkereh) is taken from the
    book Our Martyrs in the Path to Freedom by Rah-e Kargar publications,
    copyright 1988. He was born in Tehran. He earned a Bachelors Degree and
    worked as a teacher. He was a sympathizer of the Rah-e Kargar Organization
    and was active in the Independent Teacher’s Association in Tehran. This
    execution was also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) in 1985. The list
    includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. "Rah-e
    Kargar" or the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was
    established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They introduced themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are unknown. According to the Rah-e Kargar book, in
    1982, Mr. Daskereh tried to save one of his comrades who had attended a
    secret meeting, which the authorities were alerted of. However the
    building at which the meeting was taking place was surrounded by the
    police and he was arrested. He was taken to the Evin Prison. According to
    the same source, he remained unidentified during his first year in prison.
    However, after he was identified, he was tortured severely. During his two
    years of imprisonment, he was denied the right to have an attorney and was
    not allowed visits from friends and family for well over a year. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information
    is available on Mr. Daskereh’s charges. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defence No information is available about the defendant’s
    defence. Judgment No specific information is available about the
    defendant’s execution. According to the book, Mr. Daskereh was executed by
    a firing squad in the Evin Prison on June 20, 1984. His body was not given
    to his family. A few nights after his execution, someone from the prison
    called his family to notify them of his death. His family went to the Evin
    Prison; but, officials denied the news for several days, but later
    informed his father of his burial location.
