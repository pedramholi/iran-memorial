    Colonel Bijan Kabiri was among the 282 individuals listed in a United
    Nations Report on The Situation of Human Right in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran (Note by the Secretary General), published on November 13, 1985. The
    report lists these individuals as "Persons Who Were Allegedly Summarily
    and Arbitrarily Executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran: 1984-1985."
    Information about Colonel Kabiri is taken from the book The Tudeh Martyrs
    , copyright 2001 by The Tudeh Party of Iran publications and the book
    Memories by Mohammad Rayshahri (the Chief Judge of the time) published by
    the Center for Islamic Revolution Documents. He was born in Tehran,
    graduated from the Military College and was an army colonel. He was also a
    member of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941.
    The Tudeh's ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the
    former Soviet Union. The Tudeh Party played a major role in Iran's
    political scene until it was banned for the second time following the
    August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh Party declared
    the Ayatollah Khomeini and his Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Tudeh Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    its attacks from 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members were
    imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Colonel Kabiri was arrested by the
    Revolutionary Guards in May 1983. Trial According to the book Memories ,
    the trial of this defendant was on December 8, 1983 and the judge was Ali
    Yunesi. He was tried along with Colonel Hushang Attarian. Charges
    According to the book Memories , the charges against Colonel Kabiri were
    as follows: A) Activity in the underground military network while working
    for Mohammad Hadi Partovi. B) Having rendezvous and organizational
    meetings in his residence, on various streets, and in public places where
    Kianuri was sometimes present. C) Paying the [Tudeh Party’s] monthly
    membership fee of 1000 Tomans and up to 20,000 Tomans. D) Giving secret
    information about his activities to the [Tudeh] Organization and
    infiltrating revolutionary organizations. E) Giving two Yuzi weapons along
    with two revolvers to the Organization using his military status. F)
    Introducing a military person to the Organization. G) Disobeying the
    Imam's order and continuing to have active connections with the
    Organization until his arrest. H) Continuing his work for the Organization
    in prison. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the book Memories , the
    evidence against him was due to "the statements of his Party's high
    ranking members." Defence In his defence, the defendant said that he did
    not know his activities were against Islam. The book Memories quotes part
    of his defence: "His connection with the party was not based on ideology,
    but social justice ….He did not imagine that he was spying for the Soviet
    Union nor did he intend to overthrow the government." Judgment The court
    condemned Colonel Kabiri to death. He was executed by a firing squad in
    Tehran on February 26, 1984.
