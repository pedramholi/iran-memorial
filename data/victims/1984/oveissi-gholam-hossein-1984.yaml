    Interview of Hamid Reza Oveissi ) He had arrived from Tehran, accompanied

    Paris. Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of
    Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of politically
    motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the 1979
    Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the country
    have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of
    individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of
    the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however,
    these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since then, both
    inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far
    identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases, there has not been much published, and
    local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
    evidence, and traces obtained through investigations conducted by local
    police and judicial authorities confirm the theory of state committed
    crimes. In some instances, these investigations have resulted in the
    expulsion or arrest of Iranian diplomats. In a few cases outside Iran, the
    perpetrators of these murders have been arrested and put on trial. The
    evidence presented revealed the defendants connection to Iran s government
    institutions, and an arrest warrant has been issued for Iran s Minister of
    Information. The manner in which these killings were organized and
    implemented in Iran and abroad is indicative of a single pattern which,
    according to Roland Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor, contains common
    parameters and detailed planning. It can be ascertained from the
    similarities between these murders in different countries that the Iranian
    government is the principal entity that ordered the implementation of
    these crimes. Iranian authorities have not officially accepted
    responsibility for these murders and have even attributed their commission
    to internal strife in opposition groups. Nevertheless, since the very
    inception of the Islamic Republic regime, the Islamic Republic officials
    have justified these crimes from an ideological and legal standpoint. In
    the spring of 1979, Sadeq Khalkhali, the first Chief Shari a Judge of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Courts, officially announced the regime s decision
    to implement extrajudicial executions and justified the decision: These
    people have been sentenced to death; from the Iranian people s
    perspective, if someone wants to assassinate these individuals abroad, in
    any country, no government has any right to bring the perpetrator to trial
    as a terrorist, because such a person is the implementing agent of the
    sentence issued by the Islamic Revolutionary Court. Therefore, they are
    Mahduroddam and their sentence is death regardless of where they are. More
    than 10 years after these proclamations, in a speech about the security
    forces success, Ali Fallahian, the regime s Minister of Information,
    stated the following regarding the elimination of members of the
    opposition: We have had success in inflicting damage to many of these
    little groups outside the country and on our borders. At the same time,
    various political, judicial, and security officials of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran have, at different times and occasions, confirmed the
    existence of a long term government policy for these extrajudicial
    killings and in some cases
