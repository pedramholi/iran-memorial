    News of the execution of Mr. Mahmud Hassani, son of Mostafa, was sent via
    an electronic form and an email by a person close to him. According to
    this information, he was born in Abadan in 1960. His father was a worker
    in the Abadan Refinery. Mr. Hassani was married and became a father to a
    baby daughter three months before his execution. He was an artist and a
    professional. He began his political activism from 1976 when he was a
    teenager. He was active during the revolution and after the fall of the
    Shah, he joined the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. He was active during the
    struggle of unemployed workers in Abadan and during the Iran/Iraq war.
    Then he went to Shiraz and joined the Fadaiyan Khalq Minority
    Organization. According to the information sent by the electronic form,
    Mr. Hassani wished a better life for the deprived and working class and
    fought for this goal. He was a freedom fighter and a socialist. He was
    honest, devoted, and chivalric. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. In 1981, the organization, which had opted
    for open political and electoral activity after the revolution, split over
    the critique of the concept of urban guerilla warfare and the support of
    the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority
    opposed the Islamic Republic, and though it did not abandon the theory of
    armed struggle, its activities were mainly limited to the political arena
    and the labor movement. Following the Mojahedin Khalq Organization s June
    21st declaration of armed struggle, the Fadaiyan announced the
    organization of combatant cells. However, based on available information,
    these cells did not become operational. Many of the groups members and
    supporters were arrested and executed in the early 1980 s. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Hassani was arrested at his residence in Shiraz on October
    21, 1983. According to the report, without a warrant or offering any
    reason, the Revolutionary Guards invaded his house the night before and
    stayed until Mr. Hassani entered his home before they arrested him. He was
    detained at the Revolutionary Guards prison. He was denied access to an
    attorney or any visitation with his family. According to his friend, he
    was tortured severely in order to reveal his comrades; but, he resisted.
    His family visited him briefly a few months later and were shock to see
    him so thin. Trial According to the report, a court in Shiraz tried Mr.
    Hassani in a few minutes session. No information is available on his
    trial. Charges According to the information sent by the electronic form,
    the charge against Mr. Hassani was being a Marxist opposed to the Islamic
    Regime. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Hassani.
    Defense According to the electronic form s sender, quoting Mr. Hassani s
    wife, when the judge asked him if he still believed in Marxism and
    received his positive response, he ruled against Mr. Hassani. No further
    information is available on Mr. Hassani s defense. Judgment According to
    the information sent by the electronic form, Mr. Mahmud Hassani was hanged
    in Shiraz on August 30, 1984. His body was given to his family. There is
