    Information about Mr. Hushang Amirpur has been taken from an electronic
    form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. Mr. Amirpur is
    also one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. According
    to the form, Mr. Amirpur, a teacher and a member of the Confederation of
    Iranian Students, returned to Iran in 1979. He started a newspaper, which
    was published for 2 or 3 years. His pregnant wife was arrested and their
    child was born in prison. According to Mojahed , Mr. Amirpur was
    affiliated with the Ranjbaran Party. The Confederation of Iranian
    Students, National Union, (CISNU) was the outcome of a 1962 merger of
    Iranian students’ associations formed a couple of years earlier in Europe
    and the United States with the aim of promoting cooperation, strengthening
    students groups, and informing them of their rights and obligations. The
    Confederation was composed mainly of members or sympathizers of the
    National Front and the Tudeh. During the first years of its activities,
    the organization’s leadership was dominated by the National Front
    supporters. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Confederation became a significant
    opposition force outside Iran, bringing media visibility to political
    prisoners and repression in Iran. In 1971, the Iranian government declared
    the CISNU illegal. The Confederation radicalized progressively and by the
    mid-1970s, it was dominated by pro-guerrilla student organizations. Its
    new Charter (1975) explicitly called for the overthrow of the Shah’s
    regime. After the Islamic Revolution most of its members returned to Iran.
    The Ranjbaran Party of Iran was established, in Tehran, by a number of
    Marxist groups and parties in late December 1979. The founders of
    Ranjbaran were Marxist – Leninist and followers of Mao Tse-Tung’s school
    of thought. They opposed the USA and the USSR and supported Ruhollah
    Khomeini as an anti-imperialist leader. During the massive repression of
    1981, the party was banned and its leaders were executed. Its publication,
    Ranjbar , is occasionally published outside Iran since 1981. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Amirpur’s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial There is no information regarding this trial. Charges The
    charges brought against the defendant are not known. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense No information is available concerning Mr. Amirpur’s
    defense. Judgment No specific information is available about the verdict
    leading to this execution. According to Mojahed , Mr. Hushang Amirpur was
    shot by a firing squad on July 18, 1984 in Tehran.
