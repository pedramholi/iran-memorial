    The execution of Mr. Musa Kazemi, along with eight others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami Daily on August 30, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Kazemi was an international professional
    drug trafficker. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Kazemi s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashad sentenced Mr. Kazemi to death. Having
    been confirmed by the Islamic Revolution s Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out.
