circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Ne mati, along with 24 others, was announced in
    a communiqu from the public relations office of the Anti-Narcotics Section
    of Tehran s Public Prosecutor s Office. The communiqu was reported in the
    Jomhuri Eslami Daily on December 9, 1984. The communiqu stated: " The
    Anti-Narcotics Section of Tehran s Public Prosecutor s Office declared 25
    international professional drug traffickers corruptors on earth and issued
    a firm and revolutionary death sentence against them. These sentences were
    issued following the repeated warnings by the Public Prosecutor s Office
    to the drug smugglers- these death dealers and partisans of estekbar-e
    jahani (the universal arrogance) to repent from their hideous acts and
    return to the humane, Islamic society of Iran. Moreover, the Hezbollah
    Ummah (community) had recurrently asked the Islamic Revolution s Tribunals
    for severe punishment of these persons who consciously corrupted the young
    in this country." Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant
    s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Ne mati was
    charged with purchasing and distributing 186 kg of opium, having contacts
    with the international smugglers from Kerman and Baluchestan, being
    convicted 6 times as well as being consistently and actively involved in
    purchasing and distributing drugs. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ne mati
    s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    declared Mr. Ne mati a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death.
    Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Court, the sentence was
    carried out in prison at dawn.
