    The information about Mr. Maqsud Fathi has been gathered from his
    brother’s letter to him, published on Asr-e Nou website (August 19, 2009),
    on the 25th anniversary of his execution. Mr. Fathi is also one of the
    12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list
    includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Additional
    information about him is taken from the book Our Martyrs for Freedom and
    Socialism by Rah-e Kargar publication. Mr. Fathi was born in a village
    around Tabriz. He went to high school in Orumieh. He was a sociology
    graduate from Tehran University. He worked with the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization starting in 1975. In 1979, he joined the Rah-e Kargar
    Organization and played a role in the publication of Rah-e Kargar
    magazine. Mr. Fathi’s brother writes about him, “Your presence made me
    feel safe and happy… You laughed little, but you spoke even less. But you
    spoke kindly, kinder than all the world’s smiles.” “Rah-e Kargar” or the
    “Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran” was established in the summer
    of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist
    groups who had rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in
    political action. They introduced themselves as Marxist-Leninists,
    promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat.
    They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they
    opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest
