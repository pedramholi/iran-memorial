    The information regarding the execution of Mr. Mas ud Ne matollahi, son of
    Mohammad Mohsen, was sent to the Boroumand Foundation via an electronic
    form by a person informed about this case. According to this information,
    he was born in Malayer in 1946. He was an agricultural engineer and worked
    in the Agricultural Organization in Tehran. Mr. Ne matollahi was married
    and at the time of his execution had a two-year-old son and a
    five-year-old daughter. The person who sent the electronic form remembers
    Mr. Ne matollahi as an honorable, honest, and a kind man with a beautiful
    soul. Mr. Ne matollahi s younger brother (Amir Sa ed Ne matollahi) was
    executed two and half years later in 1986. Mr. Ne matollahi and his
    brother were sympathizers of the Iranian Fighting Workers Organization, a
    faction that had split from the Tufan Organization. Mr. Ne matollahi is
    one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    Marxist-Leninist Organization of Tufan was founded in the late 1960s.
    De-Stalinization policy of Khoroshev in the Soviet Union led to a
    political crisis in Iranian communist party Tudeh, as in many communist
    parties around the world. Three Tudeh leaders i.e. Forutan, Qasemi Saqa i
    left the Party in 1963 to found the Revolutionary Organization of the
    Tudeh Party and then the Marxist-Leninist Organization of Tufan . The
    organization changed its name after the 1979 revolution and first became
    The Party of workers and farmers of Iran and later on Iran Work Party,
    Tufan. The Party believed in a one-party system and supported a political
    system modeled after Albania, which it considered as the only socialist
    countries. The Organization of Struggling Workers of Iran is a split from
    Tufan founded by some of the party s personnel. Arrest and detention
    According to the information sent by the electronic form, Mr. Ne matollahi
    was arrested at the Laleh Park in Tehran in August of 1982. Three months
    after his arrest, his younger brother Amir Sa ed was arrested in Bandar
    Abbas. Mr. Ne matollahi was denied any visitation with his family for six
    months and only once was allowed to write a letter informing his family of
    his whereabouts. After that six-month, he was allowed 20-minue monthly
    visitation behind a glass screen through a phone. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Ne matollahi s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Ne
    matollahi are unknown. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against Mr. Ne matollahi cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    did not provide any specific information on the evidence presented against
    Mr. Ne matollahi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ne matollahi
    s defense. He was denied the right to an attorney. Judgment According to
    the information provided in the electronic form, Mr. Ne matollahi was
    executed by a firing squad in the Evin prison on January 24, 1984.
    Authorities informed his family eight days later on February 1, 1984 at
    mid night with a phone call telling them to go to the Evin Prison to pick
    up Mr. Ne matollahi s clothes and will. Based on the addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine, Mr. Ne matollahi was killed under torture.
