    The execution of Mr. Jebre’il Amirjahed Danablu, along with 24 others, was
    announced in a communiqué by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotics
    Section of the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran. The communiqué was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on August 8, 1984. Additional
    information has been sent to Omid via an electronic form by an individual
    familiar with this case. Mr. Amirjahed Danablu was born in Ardebil and
    worked as a tailor. The sender of the electronic form, without mentioning
    the name of a particular organization or party, states that Mr. Amirjahed
    Danablu had a certain political affiliation. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to this communiqué, Mr. Amirjahed Danablu was charged with
    “being consistently and actively involved in supplying narcotics,
    possessing 286 gm of cocaine when arrested, being a narcotics broker to
    buy 300 kg of morphine and collaborating with international professional
    smugglers in Zahedan.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine, methadone, or morphine) of proscribed narcotics. The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Amirjahed Danablu’s defense. The sender
    of the electronic form states that Mr. Amirjahed Danablu was executed due
    to political reasons and his political affiliation. Judgment The
    Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal declared Mr. Amirjahed
    Danablu a “corruptor on earth” and sentenced him to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in prison at
    dawn.
