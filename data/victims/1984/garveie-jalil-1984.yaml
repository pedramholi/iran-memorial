    The execution of Mr. Jalil Garveie, along with 24 others, was announced in
    a communiqué by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor’s
    Office. The communiqué was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on April
    9, 1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges According to this communiqué, Mr. Garveie was
    charged with “being actively involved in the supply and distribution of
    narcotics.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown Evidence of guilt According to this report, Mr. Garveie was
    “storing 208.5 g of heroin and 9.5 g of opium when he was arrested, and
    has 18 previous convictions.” Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Garveie’s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal sentenced Mr. Garveie to death. After being confirmed by the
    Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out at dawn.
