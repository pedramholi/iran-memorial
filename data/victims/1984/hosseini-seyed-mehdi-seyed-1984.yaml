    The execution of Mr. Seyed Mehdi Seyed Hosseini, along with 24 others, was
    announced in a communiqué by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor’s Office. The communiqué was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on April 9, 1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this communiqué,
    Mr. Seyed Hosseini was charged with “establishing an international
    drug-trafficking gang, being actively involved in supplying and
    distributing narcotics, buying 4300 kg of heroin from eastern Iran and
    selling it in Tehran, and having contacts with major traffickers on the
    eastern borderline of Iran.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Evidence of guilt According to this report,
    Mr. Seyed Hosseini was “in possession of 531 g of heroin when he was
    arrested, and had a criminal record for supplying and distributing
    narcotics.” Defense No information is available on Mr. Seyed Hosseini’s
    defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    sentenced Mr. Seyed Hosseini to death. After being confirmed by the
    Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out at dawn.
