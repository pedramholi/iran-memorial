    He was a freedom-loving human being. While his own circumstances were
    comfortable, he was concerned about other people and he would not bow down
    to cruelty and oppression. Information about the life and execution of Mr.
    Parviz Khodnegah, son of Zarafshan and Dadash, was obtained from an
    electronic document sent to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center by one of his
    relatives (February 12, 2023), from his will (July 15, 1984), and from
    letters he sent his family from Evin Prison. Mr. Parviz Khodnegah is one
    of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed Magazine
    (No. 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list
    includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication of the magazine. News of the
    execution of Mr. Khodnegah (Khodnegar) was also published in the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization website. Mr. Khodnegah was 27 years old. He had a high
    school diploma, he was married, and he drove a taxi for an agency in town.
    He was a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. According to a
    relative, He was a freedom-loving human being. While his own circumstances
    were comfortable, he was concerned about other people and he would not bow
    down to cruelty and oppression. (Electronic document, February 12, 2023)
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This
    organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline.
    However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they
    believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism
    as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered
    Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s,
    the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and
    executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization
    refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed
    and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as
    its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of
    the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the
    MKO were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the revolutioin, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Republic leaders. *
    Arrest and detention One night in December 1981, Mr. Khodnegah was
    arrested at his home along with his 17-year-old brother, without an arrest
    warrant being presented, by armed persons from the Evin Task Force Area 13
    Nazi Abad Tehran Committee. After searching the home, they were taken to
    Evin Prison to answer a few questions. After the arrest of Mr. Khodnegah
    and his brother, the family had no news of them for more than a month and
    they could not get answers from any agency. In the first letter he sent
    his family on February 3, 1982, he said he was being held in section 2,
    room 1 on the lower level of Evin Prison. Mr. Khodnegah was incarcerated
    in Evin and Gohardasht Prisons for 3 years and 4 months. Trial Mr.
    Khodnegah s trial was held in Evin Prison (Electronic document, February
    12, 2023), but there is no information about his court proceedings.
    Charges There is no information about the charges brought against Mr.
    Khodnegah. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Khodnegah s
    defense. He was deprived of having an attorney (Electronic document,
    February 12, 2023). Judgment Mr. Parviz Khodnegah was executed by firing
    squad at Evin Prison, on July 15, 1984. Mr. Khodnegah addressed his family
    in his will and testament, Father, mother, brothers, sisters, and my dear
    wife, Today, July 15, 1984, is the day I bid you dear ones farewell. I
    really don t know what to say. I cannot find the right words. Your love
    and kindness is beyond measure. In any case, today i
