    The execution of Mr. Gholam Hossein Kiani, along with 24 others, was
    announced in a communiqué by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor’s Office. The communiqué was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on April 9, 1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this communiqué,
    Mr. Kiani was charged with “large-scale supplying and distributing of
    opium, having contacts with major smuggling gangs, selling 14 kg of opium
    and armed attack on the officers.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Evidence of guilt According to this report,
    Mr. Kiani was “in possession of 19.2 kg of opium and a 45 caliber pistol
    when he was arrested.” Defense No information is available on Mr. Kiani’s
    defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    sentenced Mr. Kiani to death. After being confirmed by the Supreme Court,
    the sentence was carried out at dawn.
