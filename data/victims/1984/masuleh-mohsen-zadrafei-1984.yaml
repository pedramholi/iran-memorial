    The information about Mr. Mohsen Zadrafe’i Masuleh, son of Mohammad, was
    sent to Omid by a relative through an electronic form. Mr. Zadrafe’i
    Masuleh was born in Chalus in 1956 and sympathized with the Razmandegan
    Organization. The Razmandegan Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded in the winter of 1979. Its activities were
    focused on the working class and factories. The founding tenets of
    Razmandegan included the rejection of armed struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. It viewed the
    Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state and believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles. Razmandegan was among the
    groups that became known as Khat-e Se (Third line). By early 1981,
    disagreements on the Party’s position on the Iran-Iraq war caused internal
    splits in Razmandegan. These splits, which coincided with the massive and
    brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian government, caused the
    Organization to disband. Arrest and detention Mr. Zadrafe’i Masuleh was
    arrested in 1983 and held at Evin prison. He had visits with his father a
    few times. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against the defendant is not known. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Zadrafe’i Masuleh’s defense. Judgment There is no
    information on the verdict leading to this execution. Mr. Zadrafe’i
    Masuleh was executed in May 1984 at Evin prison at the age of 28.
