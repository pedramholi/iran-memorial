    The execution of Mr. Gholam Kazemi, along with five others, was announced
    by the public relations of the Islamic Revolution s Public Prosecutor s
    Office in Mashad and reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on April 23,
    1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Kazemi was
    charged with possessing 836 kg of opium. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Kazemi s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashad sentenced
    Mr. Kazemi to death. Having been confirmed by the Islamic Revolution s
    Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
