    News of the execution of Mr. Yunes Noruzi Iranzad (also spelled "Yunis
    Nawruzi-Iranzad") , son of Abdollah and Ma sumeh, was published in the
    Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran website (June 13, 2019) and by the
    Campaign to Stop Harassment and Imprisonment of Baha i Citizens List of
    Baha i Martyrs and Prominent Persons (January 10, 2017). Additional
    information about this case was obtained from Mr. Noruzi Iranzad s Death
    Certificate (November 5, 1984) and from the Negah website (October 24,
    2017). Mr. Noruzi Iranzad was among 282 individuals whose name was
    published in a United Nations Report on the Human Rights Situation in
    Iran, dated November 13, 1985. The Report contains a list entitled
    Individuals said to have been arbitrarily or summarily executed in the
    Islamic Republic: 1984 1985 . Mr. Noruzi Iranzad was born into a Baha i
    family on August 9, 1926, in the town of Marand in Eastern Azarbaijan
    Province. He earned a high school diploma and was employed by the
    Education Ministry in the city of Abadan. He worked as a teacher for a
    while but was fired because of his belief in the Baha i faith. He then
    worked for Bank Melli in the town of Sirjan for a while, and retired in
    1979 in Tehran. His retirement pension was cut off in 1981 because of his
    religious beliefs. He moved to the city of Karaj after his retirement in
    order to proselytize the Baha i faith, and became a member of the local
    Spiritual Assembly* and handled the affairs of the Baha i community in his
    place of residence. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the
    members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious
    minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the
    time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified
    and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention On July 27, 1983, Mr.
    Noruzi was arrested at his home in Karaj and taken to Tehran s Evin
    Prison. He was severely tortured for several months . (Archives of Baha i
    Persecution in Iran). Mr. Noruzi Iranzad was in prison for one year and
    three months. Trial No information is available on Mr. Noruzi s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Noruzi is not known. Because of the
    unanimous international condemnation of the persecution of this quietist
    (apolitical) religious community, Iranian authorities do not always admit
    that the Baha'is are being punished for their religious beliefs.
    Therefore, judicial authorities have often wrongfully charged Baha'is with
    offenses such as "being involved in counter-revolutionary activities,"
    "having supported the former regime," "being agents of Zionism," or "being
    involved with prostitution, adultery, and immorality." Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Noruzi. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Noruzi s defense. The representatives of the Baha'i community
    stress that their members are being persecuted for their religious
    beliefs. They refute the validity of charges such as counter-revolutionary
    political activities or spying leveled against them in Iranian courts.
    They point out that the fundamental principles of their religion require
    them to show loyalty and obedience to their government and refrain from
    any political involvement. Judgment On October 28, 1984, Mr. Yunes Noruzi
    Iranzad and one other individual were hanged at Tehran s Evin Prison.
