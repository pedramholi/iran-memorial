    The information regarding Mr. Gholam Jalili Kohnehshahri s execution is
    based on an interview with one of his relatives. He is one of the 430
    individuals whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr. Jalili
    Kohnehshahri was a student in Tehran s Polytechnic University majoring in
    Mechanical Engineering. He worked on the project building the Ekbatan
    Apartments. He was a member of the Peykar Organization for Freedom of the
    Working Class. Arrest and detention Mr. Jalili Kohnehshahri was arrested
    during a secret meeting on October 5, 1983. He was interrogated and
    detained in the Evin Prison. He was denied the right to have an attorney
    and his only visitor was his mother two months after he was imprisoned. In
    total, he was allowed visitors only four or five times during his 6-month
    detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    According to his relatives, he did not mention anything about his trial
    during his visitations. Charges No information is available on Mr. Jalili
    Kohnehshahri's charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Jalili Kohnehshahri's defense. Judgment No
    details are available concerning the judgment and the execution date of
    Mr. Jalili Kohnehshahri. But, according to a note written on his blanket
    given to his mother by prison officials, it is possible that he was
    executed on April 4, 1984. According to his relatives, when his mother
    went to visit him, the prison officials told her she could not visit him
    and gave her a phone number to call. During this call, his family was
    notified of his execution. They were told that he was buried in Beheshteh
    Zahra. But, later on, (on December 29), they told the family that he was
    buried in the Khavarn cemetery instead.
