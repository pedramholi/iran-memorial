    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Kaka’i Qomi, along with 24 others, was
    announced in a communiqué by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor’s Office. The communiqué was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on April 9, 1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this communiqué,
    Mr. Kaka’i Qomi was charged with “storing and hiding 40 g of heroin, and
    buying heroin in Zahedan for three years and selling it in packages
    containing 300 g in Tehran” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Evidence of guilt According to the report,
    Mr. Kaka’i Qomi was “in possession of 23 g of heroin at the time of his
    arrest, he sold 9.5 g of heroin to the officers, and had 11 previous
    convictions for supplying and distributing narcotics.” Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Kaka’i Qomi’s defense. Judgment The
    Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Kaka’i Qomi to
    death. After being confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out at dawn.
