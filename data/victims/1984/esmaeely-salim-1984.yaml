    The execution of Mr. Salim Esmaeely, along with 18 others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on February 15, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Esmaeely was charged with being actively
    involved in the supply and distribution of narcotics, organizing a
    drug-trafficking gang, possessing 1088 kg of heroin and 1720 kg of hashish
    when arrested. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Esmaeely s defense. Judgment Tehran s
    Islamic Revolutionary Anti-Drug Tribunal sentenced Mr. Esmaeely to death.
    The sentence was carried out in Qasr prison at dawn.
