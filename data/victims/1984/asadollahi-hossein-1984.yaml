    The execution of Mr. Hossein Asadollahi, along with 24 others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotics
    Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was

    Charges According to this communiqu , Mr. Asadollahi was charged with
    being consistently and actively involved in the supply and distribution of
    heroin, being convicted of supplying and distributing heroin 12 times,
    possessing 403 gm of heroin when arrested and buying 8.150 kg of heroin
    and selling it in 50-gram as well as 100-gram packages. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Asadollahi s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal declared Mr. Asadollahi a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to
    death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out in prison at dawn.
