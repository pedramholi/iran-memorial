circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Noruz Rigiguteh, along with 24 others, was announced
    in a communiqu from the public relations office of the Anti-Narcotics
    Section of Tehran s Public Prosecutor s Office. The communiqu was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami Daily on December 9, 1984. The communiqu stated: "
    The Anti-Narcotics Section of Tehran s Public Prosecutor s Office declared
    25 international professional drug traffickers corruptors on earth and
    issued a firm and revolutionary death sentence against them. These
    sentences were issued following the repeated warnings by the Public
    Prosecutor s Office to the drug smugglers- these death dealers and
    partisans of estekbar-e jahani (the universal arrogance) to repent from
    their hideous acts and return to the humane, Islamic society of Iran.
    Moreover, the Hezbollah Ummah (community) had recurrently asked the
    Islamic Revolution s Tribunals for severe punishment of these persons who
    consciously corrupted the young in this country." Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Rigiguteh was charged with concealing 143.5
    kg of opium when arrested, dealing and distributing more than one ton of
    opium, dealing 20 kg of heroin, being consistently and actively involved
    in the purchase and distribution of heroin, and having a criminal record
    for supplying and distributing drugs. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Rigiguteh s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal declared Mr. Rigiguteh a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to
    death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Court, the sentence
    was carried out in prison at dawn.
