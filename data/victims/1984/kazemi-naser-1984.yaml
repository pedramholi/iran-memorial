    Information about Mr. Naser Kazemi was sent to Omid via several electronic
    forms, which were sent by his friends and relatives. According to this
    information, Mr. Kazemi, son of Zerafat and Seyed-Nasrollah, was born in
    Janjal village near Nurabad, Mamasani in 1956. He was single and a
    political science student (or a law student according to some reports) at
    Tehran University. According to this report, he was among the gifted
    people in Mamasani. Mr. Naser Kazemi is one of the 558 individuals whose
    names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class published on the website of Andisheh va
    Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the organization
    who died after the revolution of 1979. The Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third Line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to one electronic form report, Mr. Naser Kazemi was arrested at
    his father s house in Nurabad, Mamasani, on February 22, 1981. He was
    transferred to the Adelabad prison in Shiraz. He was denied access to an
    attorney. The Revolutionary Guards arrested him for being a member of the
    anti-revolutionary groups, and enemies of the government. According to
    another report, he was denied all his rights, and he was tortured so
    severely that most of his relatives did not recognize him during a
    visitation. Trial According to one electronic form report, after two
    months interrogation, Mr. Naser Kazemi was tried and condemned to three
    years imprisonment at the Revolutionary Guards prison. This ruling was
    changed to the death penalty two and a half years later. Charges No
    information is available on Mr. Kazemi's charges. Evidence of guilt
    According to one electronic form report, after clashes on November 29,
    1980, Mr. Naser Kazemi delivered a speech that became a main reason for
    his execution. Defense No information is available on Mr. Kazemi's
    defense. Judgment According to one electronic form report, he was executed
    in Shiraz on September 20, 1984. According to another electronic form, he
    was hanged with a chain instead of a rope. When the body was delivered to
    the family, chain marks were evident. Mr. Kazemi was buried at the
    Darolrahmeh Cemetery in Shiraz. According to the Peykar list, Mr. Naser
    Kazemi was executed by firing squad at the Adelabad prison in Shiraz in
    1983.
