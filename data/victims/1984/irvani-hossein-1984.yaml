    The execution of Mr. Hossein Irvani, along with 24 others, was announced
    in a communiqué by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor’s
    Office. The communiqué was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on April
    9, 1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges According to this communiqué, Mr. Irvani was
    charged with “being actively involved in the supply and distribution of
    narcotics.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown Evidence of guilt According to the report, Mr. Irvani was “in
    possession of 40 centigram of heroin as well as 90 centigram of opium when
    he was arrested had 12 prior convictions.” Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Irvani’s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Irvani to death. After being
    confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out at dawn.
