    Information regarding the execution of Colonel Nostratollah (also spelled
    " Nusratu'llah") Vahdat was obtained from Issue No. 19 of The Baha i World
    ( BW Issue 19 ) as well as documents in the Archives of Baha i Persecution
    in Iran ( BPI ), including a final letter written by him. Colonel Vahdat
    is among the 282 individuals listed in a United Nations Report on The
    Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Note by the
    Secretary General), published on 13 November 1985. The report lists these
    individuals as "Persons who were allegedly summarily and arbitrarily
    executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran: 1984-1985 . He is also one of
    the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report documents the persecution of Baha is
    in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the members killed since 1978.
    Colonel Nostratollah Vahdat, son of Valiyu llah, was born into a Baha i
    family in Sangsar, Semnan in 1933 (BW Issue 19). His father and oldest
    brother both died when he was six years old. At the age of 14 he moved to
    Tehran to continue his studies and after graduating in 1956, he joined the
    military academy. In 1958 he was stationed in Kurdistan, then various
    other cities before being assigned to the city of Mashhad. At the peak of
    his career, he rose to the rank of Colonel. Colonel Vahdat married in 1961
    and had four children. In 1979, he was briefly positioned in Kermanshah
    before being dismissed later that year because of his faith, as Baha is
    were banned from serving in the military after the revolution, unless they
    were conscripted (BPI, Letter from the Head of the National Compulsory
    Service Organization). Mr. Vahdat reached out unsuccessfully to several
    high-ranking army officials and political authorities in the hope of being
    reinstated, to no avail (BW Issue 19). After his dismissal, Colonel Vahdat
    returned to Mashhad and became a very active member of the local Baha i
    community, for which he began to receive threats, the details of which are
    not known (BW Issue 19). The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the
    members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious
    minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the
    time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified
    and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and Detention Colonel Vahdat and his
    wife were first arrested on July 23 rd , 1983. They were detained for 14
    days before being given a suspended sentence of five years and being
    released (BPI). On October 10th 1983, revolutionary guards again came to
    the home of Colonel Vahdat to arrest him and his wife, but the couple were
    not home (BW Issue 19). One of their sons and their daughter were home
    however, and were arrested in their stead. They were imprisoned until
    Colonel Vahdat and his wife presented themselves to the court ten days
    later. Their son in law, Davar Nabflzadih, and Colonel Vahdat s brother,
    Muhammad- Ali Vahdat, were also arrested. According to the Archives of
    Baha i Persecution in Iran, Colonel Vahdat was severely tortured during
    his detention. (BPI) Trial No information is available about Colonel
    Vahdat s trial. Charges No information is available about the charges
    against Colonel Vahdat. However, because of the unanimous international
    condemnation of the persecution of this quietist (apolitical) religious
    community, Iranian authorities do not always admit that the Baha'is are
    being punished for their religious beliefs. Therefore, Baha'is are often
    [wrongfully] charged with offenses such as "being involved in
    counter-revolutionary activities," "having
