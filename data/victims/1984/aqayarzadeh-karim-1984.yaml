    The execution of Mr. Karim Aqayarzadeh, along with 4 others, was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on June 30, 1984. The report quoted the public
    relations of the Islamic Revolution’s Public Prosecutor’s Office in
    Tehran. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Aqayarzadeh was
    charged with “12 counts of armed robbery, 4 counts of attempted armed
    robbery, one count of first-degree murder, committing assault and battery
    against several people, selling and storing several firearms.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Aqayarzadeh’s defense. Judgment The 6th
    division of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran sentenced Mr.
    Aqayarzadeh to death. The sentence was carried out in the afternoon.
