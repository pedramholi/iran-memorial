    The execution of Mr. Hamed Totazehi, along with thirteen others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 8, 1984. Further information
    regarding Mr. Totazehi’s case was sent to Omid via an electronic form by a
    person familiar with this case. It is mentioned that Mr. Totazehi, was a
    member of the Totazehi tribe. He also participated in a group named the
    Youth Association for Justice. The tribe is situated at the Chah Rahman
    County in Zahedan; however, this region is also a strategic route for drug
    caravans. Thus, the regime has declared the members of the tribe
    criminals. For this reason, many of the members have changed their last
    name. Arrest and detention According to the information present on the
    electronic form, Mr. Totazehi was arrested in Zahedan in 1984. The further
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to
    this report, Mr. Totazehi was charged with “being actively involved in
    supplying and distributing narcotics and participation in distributing 10
    kg of heroin as well as storing 26 kg of heroin.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Totazehi defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Zahedan declared Mr. Totazehi a corruptor on earth and
    sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial
    Council, the sentence was carried out at night.
