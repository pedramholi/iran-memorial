    The execution of Mr. Seyed Hassan Hosseiny, along with 24 others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public

    was charged with being consistently involved in supplying and distributing
    narcotics, possessing 73.680 kg of opium when arrested, transporting the
    discovered narcotics from Zahedan to Tehran for sale and being a repeat
    drug offender. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.

    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense

    Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Hosseiny to
