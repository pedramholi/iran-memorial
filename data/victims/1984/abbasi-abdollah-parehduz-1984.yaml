    The execution of Mr. Abdollah Parehduz Abbasi, along with 21 others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on March 11, 1984. The communiqu states: the Anti-Narcotics Section
    of the Islamic Revolution s Public Prosecutor s Office sentenced 22
    professional traffickers who were mercenaries and servants of foreigners.
    These firm and revolutionary sentences were issued in reply to the calling
    of the valiant people that scream with all of their hearts: Fight, fight,
    fight until victory! and in defiance of our second war imposed by the
    estekbar-e jahani (Universal Arrogance). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Parehduz Abbasi was charged with being
    consistently and actively involved in dealing heroin, possessing 16 gm of
    heroin when arrested, buying packages containing 5 gm of heroin and
    selling them as well as having a criminal record for supplying and
    distributing narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Parehduz
    Abbasi s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal sentenced Mr. Parehduz Abbasi to death. Having been confirmed by
    the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in Qasr prison at dawn.
