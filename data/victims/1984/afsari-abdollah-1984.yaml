    The information about Mr. Abdollah Afsari is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs in the Path to Freedom by Rah-e Kargar publications, copyright
    1988. He was born in Mameqan near the city of Tabriz. He began his
    political activities prior to the 1979 Revolution and was imprisoned
    twice. During the Revolution, he was released from the prison and
    co-founded the Rah-e Kargar Organization. In 1979, he was responsible for
    managing this Organization in Azarbaijan. He served as a member of the
    Organization’s Central Committee. This execution was also reported in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) in 1985. The list includes 12028 individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. "Rah-e Kargar" or the "Revolutionary
    Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the summer of 1979. The
    Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist groups who
    rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They
    introduced themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the
    pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown.
    According to the above source, Mr. Afsari was arrested in Tehran in May
    1983. During his year and half imprisonment, he was so severely tortured
    that he was paralyzed by the time of his execution. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available
    on Mr. Afsari’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available about the defendant’s defence. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the defendant’s execution.
    According to the Rah-e Kargar book, Mr. Afsari was executed by a firing
    squad in the Evin Prison in the fall of 1984.
