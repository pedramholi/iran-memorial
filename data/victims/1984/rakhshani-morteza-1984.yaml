    The execution of Mr. Morteza Rakhshani, along with 26 others, was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 14, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Rakhshani was charged with being actively
    involved in supplying and distributing narcotics, collaboration with armed
    smugglers and possessing 42 kg of opium when arrested. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Rakhshani s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman
    declared Mr. Rakhshani a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death.
    Having been confirmed by the Islamic Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out in prison at dawn.
