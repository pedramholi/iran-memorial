    The execution of Mr. Yusef Shafei, along with 18 others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on February 15, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Shafei was charged with being actively
    involved in supplying and distributing heroin, possessing 150 gm of heroin
    when arrested, buying heroin from Zahedan and selling it in Tehran for 7
    months, being convicted of supplying and distributing heroin 20 times,
    robbery, selling packages containing 5 gm and 100 gm of heroin- 5 kg on
    the whole- for 3 years. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Shafei s
    defense. Judgment Tehran s Islamic Revolutionary Anti-Drug Tribunal
    sentenced Mr. Shafei to death. The sentence was carried out in Qasr prison
    at dawn.
