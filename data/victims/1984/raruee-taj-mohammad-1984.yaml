    The execution of Mr. Taj Mohammad Raruee, along with 9 others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on March 13, 1984. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are

    Charges According to this report, Mr. Raruee was charged with being armed
    and causing terror and intimidation. In this regard, he had killed one
    person. He was wounded and arrested in an armed clash with the
    Revolutionary Guards of Torbat-e Jam. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Raruee s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals of Torbat-e Jam and
    Mashad sentenced Mr. Raruee to death. Having been confirmed by the Islamic
    Revolution s Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
