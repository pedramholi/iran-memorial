    Information regarding Mr. Ali Chaharmahali Ka idi was obtained through an
    interview with one of his old friends and cellmates as well as from the
    book Parandeh-ye Noparvaz [The Bird that Had Just Learned How to Fly]
    (published by the Communist Party of Iran in summer of 2004). Mr.
    Chaharmahali Ka idi joined the revolutionary organization, Tudeh Party,
    while abroad in the 1960s. Later, he joined the Fars Artmed Movement and
    traveled to China and Cuba for political and military training. For a
    while, he did activist work with Iranian workers in Dubai. He returned to
    Iran before the revolution and joined the Ettehadieh Komonist-ha [Union of
    Communists]. He had an instrumental role in preparation for the Sarbedaran
    Uprising in 1981. In addition, he was an activist with the Workers
    Movement and a member of the Founding Board of the Abadan Project
    Syndicate. Mr. Chaharmahali was married. The Ettehadieh Komonist-ha was
    created by exiled opponents of the Pahlavi regime who mostly belonged to
    the Student Confederation. They followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung and
    did not believe in guerilla warfare. The group became marked by
    ideological divides during the periods preceding and following the 1979
    revolution which caused it to split into several factions. One of the most
    important rifts was triggered by the decision by a number of members to
    take up arms and take over a city in Iran. The uprising plan, devised in
    the midst of an active and violent anti-communist campaign by the
    revolutionary Islamic government, split the Ettehadieh in two factions:
    one believing in the armed movement and the other opposing it. In the
    winter of 1982, armed members of the Ettehadieh hid in a forest in the
    North of Iran (Jangal in Farsi) outside the city of Amol. This group, also
    known as the Jangal group, was involved in several clashes with the
    Revolutionary guards and ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of
    Amol hoping to generate a general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol
    failed. It is reported that a number of the group s members, revolutionary
    guards, and civilians were killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently,
    members of the Ettehadieh, including those who opposed the Amol uprising,
    were arrested and tried for belonging to the organization and for having
    participated in the Amol clash. Arrest and detention The details of Mr.
    Chaharmahali Ka idi s arrest are unknown. He was arrested on a Tehran
    street. According to his cellmate, he had been tortured severely during
    interrogations and his feet and calves were bandaged up to his knees. He
    had been hospitalized at the Evin Prison Medical Center for a while due to
    infected wounds on his feet. One of Mr. Chaharmahali s cellmates in Cell
    65, Ward 209 of Evin Prison, recounts the following: He had a very high
    spirit. He knew that he would be executed soon he had been tried before
    being transferred to our cell but this had not affected his mood or his
    daily routine by any means; for example, he still ate well. He said that
    he had not personally participated in the 1981 attack to Amol and that he
    regretted not having done so. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges The chargers brought against Mr. Chaharmahali
    are not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Chaharmahali s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Ali Chaharmahali Ka idi was executed on May 1st, 1984. No
    information is available on the details of the sentence.
