    The execution of Mr. Nezamodin Farand along with 12 others, was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on February 20, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Farand was charged with dealing and storing
    765 gm of heroin as well as 980 gm of hashish. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Farand s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman sentenced
    Mr. Farand to death. Having been confirmed by the Islamic Revolution s
    Supreme Court of Qom, the sentence was carried out before noon.
