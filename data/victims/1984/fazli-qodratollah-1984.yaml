    Mr. Qodratollah Fazli (Tufan) is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The Marxist-Leninist Organization of Tufan was
    founded in the late 1960s. De-Stalinization policy of Khoroshev in the
    Soviet Union led to a political crisis in Iranian communist party Tudeh,
    as in many communist parties around the world. Three Tudeh leaders i.e.
    Forutan, Qasemi & Saqa’i left the Party in 1963 to found the
    “Revolutionary Organization of the Tudeh Party” and then the
    “Marxist-Leninist Organization of Tufan”. The organization changed its
    name after the 1979 revolution and first became The Party of workers and
    farmers of Iran and later on Iran Work Party, Tufan. The Party believed in
    a one-party system and supported a political system modeled after Albania,
    which it considered as the only socialist countries. The Organization of
    Struggling Workers of Iran is a split from Tufan founded by some of the
    party’s personnel. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charge brought against the
    defendant is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
