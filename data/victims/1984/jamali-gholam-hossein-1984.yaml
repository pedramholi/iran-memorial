    The execution of Mr. Gholam Hossein Jamali, along with eight others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on December 10, 1984. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Jamali was charged with drug dealing
    . The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Jamali s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Birjand sentenced Mr. Jamali to death. Having been confirmed
    by the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Committee at dawn.
