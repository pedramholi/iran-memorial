    The execution of Mr. Abbas Tayar, along with 18 others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on February 15, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Tayar was charged with possessing 12 gm of
    heroin when arrested, dealing packages containing 5 gm of heroin for a
    year, buying heroin from Zahedan and selling it in Tehran, being convicted
    of supplying and distributing heroin several times. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Tayar s
    defense. Judgment Tehran s Islamic Revolutionary Anti-Drug Tribunal
    sentenced Mr. Tayar to death. The sentence was carried out in Qasr prison
    at dawn.
