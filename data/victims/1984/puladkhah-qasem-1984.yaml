    The execution of Mr. Qasem Puladkhah, along with 24 others, was announced
    in a communiqu by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotics Section of
    the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on August 8, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this communiqu , Mr. Puladkhah was charged with being
    consistently and actively involved in the supply and distribution of
    narcotics, possessing 9.880 kg of hashish when arrested, dealing 20.500 kg
    of hashish at three different times, organizing a drug-trafficking gang
    and having a criminal record for supplying and distributing narcotics. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Puladkhah s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal declared Mr. Puladkhah a corruptor on earth and
    sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the
    sentence was carried out in prison at dawn.
