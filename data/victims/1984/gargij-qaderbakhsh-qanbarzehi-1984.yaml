    The execution of Mr. Qaderbakhsh Qanbarzehi Gargij, along with 24 others,
    was announced in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office.The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily
    on May 21, 1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant
    s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges According to this communiqu , Mr.
    Qanbarzehi Gargij was charged with organizing an international
    drug-trafficking gang, being consistently involved in supplying and
    distributing narcotics, possessing 415.100 kg of morphine when arrested,
    having a criminal record for buying and distributing narcotics as well as
    supplying narcotics via eastern border. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Qanbarzehi Gargij s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Qanbarzehi Gargij to death. The
    sentence was carried out at dawn.
