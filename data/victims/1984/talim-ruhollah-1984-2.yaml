    Information about the execution of Dr. Ruhollah (also spelled "

    Iran, including Mr. Ruhollah Ta lim s will (December 9th, 1984), and a
    short biography dedicated to him Rouhollah Ta'lim - Exeucted by hanging in

    collected from an article published on IranWire Dr. Ta'lim: They told him
    to dissimulate and say that he is a Muslim. He smiled and was executed
    (December 23rd, 2020). Dr. Rouhollah Ta'lim is one of the 206 Iranian Baha
    is listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i International
    Community. The report documents the persecution of the members of the Baha
    i faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists those killed since 1978.
    Additional information has been drawn from various issues of The Baha i
    World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Dr. Ruhollah Ta
    lim was born on October 19th, 1937 in Tehran (IranWire). His father
    Ebrahim was a mercer who had converted from Judaism to Baha ism in his
    youth, and his mother, Sareh, was Jewish, though she raised her children
    with Baha i teachings (IranWire, ABPI). Upon finishing high school in
    1955, he attended the Tehran University Medical School and graduated with
    a specialization in gynecology at 25 (IranWire, ABPI). Shortly after, Dr.
    Ta lim completed his mandatory service by serving in the Health Corps in
    Khorramabad, before returning to Tehran for a short period of time
    (IranWire). Subsequently, he relocated to Kermanshah and in 1977 and
    established Arya Hospital. Dr. Ta lim served in the Local Spiritual
    Assembly of Kermanshah for many years (ABPI). In 1980, he was arrested by
    Revolutionary Guards in his clinic. He was later released on bail
    (IranWire). After leaving the city briefly for his safety in 1982, Dr. Ta
    lim returned to Kermanshah and turned himself into the Revolutionary
    Prosecutor s office. He was released after a few hours of questioning
    (IranWire). He loved his wife, and children, Shaghayegh and Nikan, dearly
    (ABPI), believed in serving his country, and was devoted to serving his
    patients to the best of his abilities (IranWire). The Baha is in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Baha i National Spiritual Assembly After the
    Islamic Revolution In the organizational structure of the Baha i
    community, the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly is a body
    composed of nine individuals that are elected annually with the votes of
    adult Baha is in each country. This institution tends to the affairs and
    issues of the Baha i community on the national level. The National
    Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of guiding, coordinating, and
    moving forward the activities of each country s local spiritual
    assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl ( House of Justice
    ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the highest
    decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I s
    Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual
    assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz,
    were se
