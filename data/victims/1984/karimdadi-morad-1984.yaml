    The execution of Mr. Morad Karimdadi, along with 26 others, was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 14, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Karimdadi was charged with collaboration
    with armed smugglers, dealing more than 210 kg of opium and possessing 150
    kg of it when arrested. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Karimdadi s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman
    declared Mr. Karimdadi a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death.
    Having been confirmed by the Islamic Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out in prison at dawn.
