    The information below regarding Mr. Abdollah Tajzadeh is based on an
    electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation by one of his relatives.
    According to this information, Mr. Tajzadeh, son of Mehdi, was born in
    Qods city (formerly known as Hassan Khan castle) in 1965. He was a high
    school graduate and owned a small bookstore where he had a copy machine
    and copied political pamphlets. He was a non-religious person who believed
    in social justice and leftist ideology and was a sympathizer of the Komala
    party. Mr. Tajzadeh is one of the individuals who name and date of
    execution is published in the Komala’s List of Martyrs. Komala: Several
    remaining members of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran established
    the Revolutionary Organization of this party in Iraq in the mid 1960s.
    Esma’il Sharifzadeh, Abdollah Mo’ini, and Molaavareh were among the
    leaders of this organization who, inspired by the Cuban Revolution, began
    an armed guerrilla struggle in Kurdistan. When this group was defeated in
    1969 and several of its members were arrested, armed struggle was
    criticized and the Maoist trend overcomes. When some of its leaders were
    released in 1978, the Revolutionary Organization of Working People in
    Kurdistan – Komala was established. Based on Marxist theory, Komala was
    against the capitalists and landlords and encouraged workers and peasants
    in Kurdistan to an armed uprising against them and the central government.
    This organization considered the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI)
    as the rich party and campaigned against it, resulting in several armed
    conflicts and hundreds dead. In 1982, Komala joined another Marxist group,
    Sahand, which was basically a theoretical group, and established the
    Communist Party of Iran. Then it became called the Kurdistan Organization
    of the Communist Party of Iran – Komala. Years later, this organization
    separated from the Communist Party of Iran and faced several schisms. The
    Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan, led by Abdollah Mohtadi, Komala, and
    the Kurdistan Organization of the Communist Party of Iran led by Ebrahim
    Alizadeh are some of these factions. Arrest and detention According to the
    electronic information that was sent to the Boroumand Foundation, Mr.
    Tajzadeh was arrested at the age of 17 in his father’s house in Qods city
    in the spring of 1982. The agents of the regime entered the house without
    a warrant and forcefully placed him under arrest. They also arrested his
    father, an old man who was a Gonabadi dervish, but released him three
    weeks later. Mr. Tajzadeh, however, was immediately transferred to the
    Evin Prison where he was denied any visitations for a year. Later he was
    allowed monthly visitation with his parents and sometimes with his two
    sisters. The visitations were suddenly discontinued in the Spring of 1984.
    Upon the inquiry, Mr. Tajzadeh’s family were told that he was executed.
    During Mr. Tajzadeh’s last visitation with his family, he told them that
    his shoulder was broken and that he had kidney problems. Mr. Tajzadeh’s
    family believe that he suffered these injuries under torture. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information
    is available on any charges against the Mr. Tajzadeh The validity of any
    criminal charges brought against the accused cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    According to the information provided to the Boroumand Foundation, Mr.
    Tajzadeh’s family did not see any evidence of a case against him and that
    he was not involved in any militia or other armed activities. However,
    when the regime agents were searching his house, they found a weapon that
    was hidden inside the television. It is possible that Mr. Tajzadeh
    acquired that weapon from the army garrisons during the revolution and hid
    it in his house. Defense According to the electronic information, Mr.
    Tajzadeh was denied the right to have an attorney. Judgment According to
    the information sent to the Boroumand Foundation, Mr. Tajzadeh was
    condemned to death and the sentence was carried out in the Evin Prison in
    June of 1984. The exact date of his execution according to the Komala’s
    List of Martyrs is June 26, 1984. Mr. Tajzadeh left behind a one-page will
    that he wrote before his execution. His will was very emotional and
    touching. The location of Mr. Tajzadeh’s grave is unknown. In 2003, one of
    his relatives attempted to find out the location of his grave, per his
    mother’s request. However, as a result of the inquiry, the relative was
    summoned to the Ministry of Intelligence. After a two-hour interrogation,
    the Intelligence agents warned the relative to stop looking for Mr.
    Tajzadeh’s grave. International laws have strictly prohibited capital
    punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment
