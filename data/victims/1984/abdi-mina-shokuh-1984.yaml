    Loved by children and her peers, she was respectful and thoughtful, tall
    and striking, true to her beliefs and her understandings. The information
    regarding Ms. Mina Shokuh Abdi was sent to the Boroumand Foundation via an
    electronic form from a former cellmate who had been in prison with her
    from the time of her arrest in 1983 until her execution in the summer of
    1985. Her cellmate recalls, Ms. Shokuh Abdi was a tall, beautiful young
    woman, with small features and black hair. She was kind, well-mannered and
    steadfast in her ideals. She was well-loved among the prisoners, but the
    detainees, who had repented and now adhered to the regime s ideology,
    hated her and kept tabs on her communications with the other prisoners.
    Arrest and detention According to the form, Ms. Shokuh Abdi was arrest for
    the first time in 1981 and taken to Evin Prison. She was transferred to
    Qezel Hesar Prison, from which she was later freed. Upon obtaining her
    freedom, Ms. Shokuh Abdi joined a fake organization designed by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office to entrap Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization s (MKO) sympathizers. She believed that she was working for
    the MKO. The organization, under the pretence of sending its members
    abroad, had collected money from them. Ms. Shokuh Abdi had also given them
    money. The members were all arrested, the majority of whom realized that
    they had been deceived during interrogations. Most were imprisoned and
    some executed. Ms. Shokuh Abdi, along with the other members, was arrested
    in 1983 and imprisoned in Evin Prison. She was detained in Ward 3 on the
    lower floor of the prison. She was denied a lawyer and had no access to
    the file containing the charges against her. At that time (spring and
    summer 1984), there were 13 children among the prisoners. Mina loved
    children and played games with them. The children enjoyed her company.
