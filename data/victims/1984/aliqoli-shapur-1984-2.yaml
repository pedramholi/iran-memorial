    The information about Mr. Shapur Aliqoli was gathered from an interview
    with a family friend. Mr. Aliqoli was born in 1959 in Tehran. He was
    married and had a daughter. He was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO). Arrest and detention Mr. Aliqoli was arrested in
    Tehran in 1981. Prior to his arrest, he was wounded in an operation of the
    MKO. The doctor who treated him, secretly allowed him to stay in her
    office. After Mr. Aliqoli decided to leave the doctor’s office, he was
    arrested and taken to Evin prison. The details of his detention are not
    known. In the beginning, the interrogators did not know his true identity
    or his political activities and he was set to be released. However, after
    some time, his identity was disclosed to the officials and – according to
    his former cellmates – he was severely tortured. His family was unaware of
    his whereabouts. Only a few months before his execution in 1984, they were
    allowed to visit him in prison. Trial There is no information regarding
    this trial. Charges The charges brought against the defendant are not
    known. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against the accused. Defense No information is
    available concerning Mr. Aliqoli’s defense. Judgment Mr. Aliqoli was
    executed in Evin prison. The officials informed his family of the
    execution on April 14, 1984. According to the records of the registration
    office of the Behesht-e Zahra Cemetery, he was buried on April 7, 1984,
    and his family believes that he was executed the same day. Mr. Aliqoli’s
    will was returned to his family and is dated April 4, 1984. Mr. Aliqoli
    was most likely executed by firing squad. This was the common execution
    method prior to 1988. He is buried in the section of the Behesht-e Zahra
    Cemetery where executed persons are interred. Family members of these
    persons are not allowed to place a gravestone on graves. There are no
    trees in this section. Families put cement on the graves, place the
    victims’ pictures, and write their names on the cement. A few times, Mr.
    Aliqoli’s family placed his picture on this grave. But every few years,
    state agents destroy demarcations of the graves. Mr. Aliqoli’s mother has
    since passed away. Mothers of other executed persons have placed cement on
    his grave and written his name on it.
