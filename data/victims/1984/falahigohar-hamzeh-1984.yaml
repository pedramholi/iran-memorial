    The execution of Mr. Hamzeh Falahigohar, along with 24 others, was
    announced in a communiqu from the public relations office of the
    Anti-Narcotics Section of Tehran s Public Prosecutor s Office. The
    communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami Daily on December 9, 1984.
    The communiqu stated: " The Anti-Narcotics Section of Tehran s Public
    Prosecutor s Office declared 25 international professional drug
    traffickers corruptors on earth and issued a firm and revolutionary death
    sentence against them. These sentences were issued following the repeated
    warnings by the Public Prosecutor s Office to the drug smugglers- these
    death dealers and partisans of estekbar-e jahani (the universal arrogance)
    to repent from their hideous acts and return to the humane, Islamic
    society of Iran. Moreover, the Hezbollah Ummah (community) had recurrently
    asked the Islamic Revolution s Tribunals for severe punishment of these
    persons who consciously corrupted the young in this country." Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to this communiqu , Mr. Falahigohar was charged with
    possessing 88 gm of heroin when arrested, previously being convicted of
    purchasing and distributing drugs 15 times, possessing 566 gm of heroin in
    his house, dealing heroin in 50, 100 and 150-gram packages 10 to 15 times,
    being highly active in supplying and selling heroin as well as being
    addicted. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Falahigohar s defense. Judgment The
    Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal declared Mr. Falahigohar a
    corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by
    the Supreme Judicial Court, the sentence was carried out in prison at
    dawn.
