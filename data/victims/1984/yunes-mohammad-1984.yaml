    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Yunes, along with 9 others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on March 13, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Yunes was charged with possessing and
    selling 4.520 kg of heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Yunes
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals of Torbat-e Jam and
    Mashad sentenced Mr. Yunes to death. Having been confirmed by the Islamic
    Revolution s Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
