    The execution of Mr. Hadi Rajab Ali, along with 18 others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on February 15, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Rajab Ali was charged with dealing more than
    22 kg of heroin several times, organizing a drug-trafficking gang and
    being convicted of supplying and distributing heroin. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rajab
    Ali s defense. Judgment Tehran s Islamic Revolutionary Anti-Drug Tribunal
    sentenced Mr. Rajab Ali to death. The sentence was carried out in Qasr
    prison at dawn.
