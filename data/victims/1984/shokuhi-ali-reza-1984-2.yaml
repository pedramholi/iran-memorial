    He studied chemical engineering and started the Red Star Group (Setareh)
    with other Pahlavi opponents. Co-initiated Rah-e Kargar. A herald of
    Lorestan Province. The information about Mr. Ali Reza Shokuhi, born in
    Aligudarz (Lorestan province) has been drawn from an interview with a
    relative, who was imprisoned in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as
    from the book Our Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism by Rah-e Kargar
    Publications. This execution was also reported in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No. 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) in 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Having graduated from high school in Borujerd
    (Lorestan province), Mr. Shokuhi studied chemical engineering for three
    years at the university of technology in Tehran. In 1970, he established
    the Setareh Sorkh (Red Star) group along with some of his comrades to
    fight the previous regime. He was arrested in 1971 and condemned to death,
    although later his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. In January,
    1979, he was released from the prison and took on an active role in the
    establishment of the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran, Rah-e
    Kargar. He was the first secretary-general of this organization. Rah-e
    Kargar or the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran was established
    in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from
    various leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and
    believed in political action. They called themselves Marxist-Leninists,
    promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat.
    They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh Party, in that
    they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini s leadership.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Ali Reza Shokuhi was arrested on June 28, 1983 in
    the house of one of the members of the central committee of the Rah-e
    Kargar Organization. According to the interviewee, the authorities did not
    have an arrest warrant and told the neighbors they were looking for drug
    smugglers. The interviewee stated: Early in the morning, the authorities
    raided the house of his comrade, Dr. Gholam [Hossein] Ebrahimzadeh, who
    tried to escape from the roof but was shot down and killed by the
    Revolutionary Guardsmen. Ali Reza was arrested and taken to the Joint
    Committee (also known as Tohid Prison, which is the Ebrat Museum, today)
    and later transferred to Evin prison. According to the above-mentioned
    book, during the 6 months of detention, Mr. Shokuhi was severely tortured.
    The interviewee stated that a former prisoner, who was Mr. Shokuhi s
    cellmate for a few days, had said that Mr. Shokuhi s feet were wounded, as
    a result of torture, and, due to being suspended in the air for too long,
    his right shoulder blade was so painful that he could not move his
    shoulder. During this time, Mr. Shokuhi was denied visits with his family,
    access to his file, and having an attorney. Trial There is no information
    regarding this trial. Charges The charges brought against the defendant
    are not known. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning
    the evidence presented against Mr. Shokuhi. Defense No information is
    available concerning Mr. Shokuhi s defense. Judgment Mr. Ali Reza Shokuhi
    was condemned to death and shot by a firing squad on January 1, 1984. The
    authorities did not disclose the place of his burial to his family. They
    only guess that he may be interred at the Khavaran cemetery. Mr. Shokuhi
    wrote in his will (several parts of which had been cut out before it was
    delivered to his family): When you receive my belongings [from prison
    authorities], keep my Seiko watch as something to remember me by. After
    all, you gave that to me as a gift.
