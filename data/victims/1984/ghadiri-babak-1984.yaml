circumstances: >
    Mr. Ghadiri was only 26 years old. He became a political activist hoping
    to improve his society; however, he was shot and killed by arresting
    agents without having a chance to be tried and defend himself. Information
    about Mr. Babak Ghadiri, son of Sajad, has been drawn from two interviews
    with his relatives. Additional information has been sent to Omid via an
    electronic form by a person familiar with this case. He is one of hundreds
    of individuals who were extra-judicially executed since the 1979
    revolution. Mr. Ghadiri was born in Tehan in 1958 and studied at the
    Iranian Banking Institute, majoring in business. He was married with one
    son. He started his political activism against the monarchy when he was a
    commerce student and soon became interested in the labor movement. He
    liked to hike in the mountains and was a members of the Hikers Society. He
    was also a founding member of the Razmandegan Organization. According to
    his relatives, he was kind, creative, and supportive to others. The
    Razmandegan Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded in the winter of 1979. Its activities were focused on the working
    class and factories. The founding tenets of Razmandegan included the
    rejection of armed struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet
    policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. It viewed the Soviet Union as a
    Social imperialist state and believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles. Razmandegan was among the groups that became
    known as Khat-e Se (Third line). By early 1981, disagreements over the
    Party s position on the Iran-Iraq war caused internal splits in
    Razmandegan. These splits, which coincided with the massive and brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government, caused the
    organization to disband. Arrest and detention According to the
    interviewees, on October 10, 1984, when the government agents ambushed Mr.
    Ghadiri s house to arrest him, he attempted to escape from the yard.
    However, the agents shot him. He fell into the empty pool and died
    quickly. He was not carrying any arms at the time of his attempted escape.
    His wife and 5-year-old son witnessed this incident. Agents arrested them.
    Mr. Ghadiri s son was released after a few days, but his wife was detained
    for six months. According to a relative of Mr. Ghadiri, a political
    activist couple who commuted to their house, had been arrested and
    revealed their location under torture. Trial Mr. Ghadiri was not summoned
    before a court, and no public trial was held in this case. Charges No
    specific charges were legally brought against Mr. Ghadiri. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against Mr. Ghadiri. Defense Mr. Ghadiri was not
    given the opportunity to defend himself in a court of law before being
    killed. Judgment No information is available about a ruling leading to Mr.
    Babak Ghadiri s death. According to his relatives, the family was not
    allowed to have any mourning ceremony. They were only informed of his
    burial location at the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in Tehran after a year.
