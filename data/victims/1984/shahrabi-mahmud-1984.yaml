    The execution of Mr. Mahmud Shahrabi, along with 24 others, was announced
    in a communiqu by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotics Section of
    the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 10, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this communiqu , Mr. Shahrabi was charged with possessing 11
    gm of heroin and opium, investing money for dealing 13 kg of heroin with
    Kiomars Kheder- another executed defendant, buying 2.250 kg of opium,
    transporting it from Khomein for sale in Tehran, concealing 3.150 kg of
    opium in his house and being convicted 9 times. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Shahrabi
    s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    declared Mr. Shahrabi a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. The
    sentence was carried out in prison at dawn.
