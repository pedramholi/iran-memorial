    Committee and an editor for the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran
    also known as Rah-e Kargar. His wife, Tahereh Seyed Ahmadi who was a
    sympathizer of this Organization, was also executed. "Rah-e Kargar" or the
    "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the summer
    of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist
    groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political
    action. They identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a
    socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed
    with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the
    Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention
