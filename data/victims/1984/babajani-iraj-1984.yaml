    The execution of Mr. Iraj Babajani, along with 4 others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on June 30, 1984. The report quoted the public
    relations of the Islamic Revolution’s Public Prosecutor’s Office in
    Tehran. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Babajani was
    charged with “9 counts of armed robbery, 2 counts of attempted armed
    robbery and storing an unauthorized firearm.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Babajani’s defense. Judgment The 6th division of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran sentenced Mr. Babajani to death.
    The sentence was carried out in the afternoon.
