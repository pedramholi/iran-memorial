    Mr. Abdolhamid Roshanfekr’s execution was reported in an addendum to the
    Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    in 1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. The information about Mr. Roshanfekr is taken from the book
    Our Martyrs in the Path to Freedom by Rah-e Kargar publications, copyright
    1988. He was born in Ardebil. He was a sociology student in Tehran
    University. In 1972, he was arrested for his relationship with the
    Fadayian Khalq Guerrilla Organization and was condemned to ten years
    imprisonment. In the prison, he began believing in fighting through
    political dissent rather than guerrilla warfare. After his release in
    1978, he joined the Rah-e Kargar Organization and became a member of the
    Council of Writers for the Rah-e Kargar publications. "Rah-e Kargar" or
    the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the
    summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various
    leftist groups who rejected the idea of an armed struggle in favor of
    working within the political system. They introduced themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's
    leadership. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are unknown. According to the Rah-e Kargar book, Mr.
    Roshanfekr was arrested along with his pregnant wife in September 1983. He
    was transferred to the Evin Prison. He reportedly died after suffering
    seven months of severe torture. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. According to the same source, Mr. Roshanfekr was not
    tried in any court. Charges No information is available on Mr. Abdolhamid
    Roshanfekr’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No
    information is available about the defendant’s defence. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the defendant’s execution.
    According to the book, no ruling was issued against Mr. Roshanfekr and he
    lost his life under torture on April 27, 1984.
