    Information about Mr. Farzad Jahad was taken from the book, "The Tudeh
    Martyrs," a publication of The Tudeh Party of Iran, and the book,
    "Memories," by Mohammad Rayshahri (Chief Judge at the time), published by
    the Islamic Revolution Document Center. Some information is based on an
    electronic form, sent to Omid , by a person familiar with his case.
    According to the existing information, Mr. Farzad Jahad was born in Shiraz
    in 1956. He studied political science at Tehran University. Before the
    revolution, he joined the Navid Organization (the underground organization
    of the Tudeh Party) and was active among the workers. In 1981, he
    continued his activities as a branch leader in the military organization
    of the Party. According to the book, "Memories," he was in charge of the
    underground network in Esfahan. Mr. Farzad Jahad is among the 282
    individuals listed in a United Nations Report on The Situation of Human
    Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Note by the Secretary General),
    published on 13 November 1985. The report lists these individuals as
    Persons who were allegedly summarily and arbitrarily executed in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: 1984-1985. The Tudeh Party of Iran ( Hezbe Tudeh
    or the Party of the Masses) was founded in 1941 by a group of mostly
    communist intellectuals. Its non-radical reformist platform and its name
    reflected the founders hopes to attract the larger religious population.
    However, the Party's Marxist-Leninist orientation and its anti-Imperialist
    and anti-Fascist positions made it most influential among intellectuals
    and educated Iranians. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, The Tudeh , with
    its country-wide organization, including active women, youth, and labor
    groups, as well as a secret military network ( Sazman-e Nezami-ye Hezb-e
    Tudeh Iran ), played a major role in Iran s political scene. The Tudeh was
    banned following an attempted assassination against the Shah in 1949.
    Nonetheless, the Party continued its activities, as well as its
    publications, of which there would be many. Following the 19 August 1953
    coup, the Tudeh s military network was annihilated and many of its leaders
    arrested or forced into exile, mostly in the Soviet Union and Eastern
    Europe. Over the years, the Party s political influence diminished, due to
    the various splits resulting from its pro-Soviet stand and policies in
    periods of political tension in Iran and from the radicalization of the
    left in the 1960s and 1970s. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported and collaborated with the
    government. Though the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became
    the target of the Islamic Republic s attacks in 1982, and the Party's
    leaders and many members, including those of the new secret military
    network, were arrested. The Tudeh lost scores of its members during the
    mass prison killing of 1988. Following several splits, the Party resumed
    its activities in the early 1990s in exile. Arrest and detention According
    to the book, "The Tudeh Martyrs," Mr. Farzad Jahad was arrested in May of
    1982. According to information sent to Omid , by the order of
    interrogators, one of his arrested comrades called Mr. Jahad, who lived
    with his parents in another city at the time, and asked him to meet at
    Ferdowsi Square in Tehran. Mr. Jahad trusted this friend and, as soon as
    he showed up at the location, he was arrested by security agents of Evin
    Prison. Trial No information is available on Mr. Jahad s trial. Charges
    Mr. Farzad Jahad was tried as a member of "the eighth group of Tudeh Party
    members who infiltrated the armed forces." The charges against him were
    confirmed in the book, "Memories," as "being in charge of several workers
    of the Party before the victory of the Islamic Revolution, having a
    nickname, being in charge of a military branch, and collecting funds for
    the Party." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt In the book, "Memories," evidence against
    Mr. Jahad is described as "the information that others provided about
    him." Defense No information is available about Mr. Jahad s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Farzad Jahad to death. This ruling was
    carried out at Jamshidiyeh Garrison in Tehran on February 26, 1984. He was
    executed by firing squad along with nine others. Addressing his family in
    a part of his will, he wrote, "In any case, I had my own life and I had to
    choose to be a human being and not a vegetable like a potato . When I
    think of you, I am ashamed that I caused you sadness. But, if you want me
    to be in peace, do not turn a hair and do not wear black clothes. Be aware
    that I like everyone. I wish freedom for all and happy days for the young
    people of my country [with] the world full of joy .Be aware that, if I
    could survive, I would walk again on the pa
