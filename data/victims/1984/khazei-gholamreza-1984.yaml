    The information about Mr. Gholamreza Khaze’i is taken from the book The
    Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001 by The Tudeh Party of Iran Publications. He
    was born in Zabol. He was a student at Tehran University majoring in
    Political Science. Before the Revolution, he joined the Navid Organization
    (the underground organization of the Tudeh Party). After the Revolution,
    he continued his activities in the same organization. Mr. Khazei is also
    among the 282 individuals listed in a United Nations Report on The
    Situation of Human Right in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Note by the
    Secretary General), published on 13 November 1985. The report lists these
    individuals as "Persons who were allegedly summarily and arbitrarily
    executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran: 1984-1985." The Tudeh Party of
    Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh's ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it
    supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major
    role in Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second time
    following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh
    Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr.
    r Khaze’i was arrested in May, 1983. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr.
    Gholamreza Khaze’i’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defence No

    condemned Mr. Khaze’i to death. He was executed by a firing squad at the

    Organization on February 26, 1984.
