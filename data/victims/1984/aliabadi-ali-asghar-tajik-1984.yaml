    The execution of Mr. Ali Asghar Tajik Aliabadi, along with 24 others, was

    Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was

    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are

    Charges According to this communiqu , Mr. Tajik Aliabadi was an
    international professional drug trafficker. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Tajik
    Aliabadi s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal declared Mr. Tajik Aliabadi a corruptor on earth and sentenced
    him to death. The sentence was carried out in prison at dawn.
