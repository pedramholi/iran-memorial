    News of Mr. Mohsen Razavi s execution was published in the Archives of
    Baha i Persecution in Iran website (September 5, 2018), and by the
    Campaign to Stop Harassment and Imprisonment of Baha i Citizens List of
    Baha i Martyrs and Prominent Persons (January 19, 2017). Mr Razavi was
    born into a Baha i family in the town of Serishabad in Kurdistan Province
    on July 7, 1926. He spent his childhood in the town of Qaraveh near the
    city of Hamedan where he finished primary school. He was married in
    1956-57 and was a government employee in Tehran. In 1964-65, Mr. Razavi
    took up residence in the village of Ozgol in the suburbs of Tehran where
    he remained until the establishment of the local Spiritual Assembly* and
    engaged in promoting the Baha i faith. He returned to Tehran after two
    years. In 1972-73, he resided in [Tehran s] Sarassiab [neighborhood] and
    subsequently in the Afsarieh [neighborhood]. He was a member of the local
    Spiritual Assembly in both places. He moved to the Tehran Pars
    [neighborhood] in 1979. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    Background The Baha i religious community is the largest minority group in
    Iran, with approximately 300,000 members in 1979 (more current figures are
    not available).* The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected
    Baha is religious to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them
    of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence. ** Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Razavi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Razavi s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr.
    Razavi is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Razavi s defense.
    Judgment On March 4, 1984, Mr. Mohsen Razavi was hanged at Tehran s Evin
    Prison. On March 13, 1984, the authorities informed one of Mr. Razavi s
    relatives that he had been executed. His body was not turned over to his
    family and the family believes that he was probably buried by government
    agents. ----------------------------------- * Slow Death for Iran s Baha
    is by Richard N. Ostling, Time Magazine,20 February 1984. Also see The
    Persecution of the Baha is of Iran, 1844-1984, by Douglas Martin, Baha i
    Studies,volume 12/13, 1984, p. 3. There is no information about the
    current number of Baha is in Iran. ** The Islamic Republic Penal Code
    grants no rights to Baha is, and the courts have denied them the right to
    redress or to protection against assault, murder, and other forms of
    persecution and abuse. In so doing, the courts have treated Baha is as
    unprotected citizens or apostates, citing eminent religious authorities
    whose edicts are considered a source of law equal to acts of Parliament.
    The Founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, made execution a
    punishment for the crime of apostasy and decreed that a Muslim would not
    be punished for killing an apostate. Banishment from public functions has
    seriously damaged the Baha is professional, economic, and social lives.
    Soon after the revolution, a Ministry of Labor directive called for the
    dismissal from public office and all governmental organizations and
    associations of those who belong to any of the misguided sects recognized
    by all Muslims as heretical deviations from Islam, or to organizations
    whose doctrine and constitution are based on rejection of the
    divinely-revealed religions. Finally, the mandatory requirement of
    specifying religion in application forms and official documents (lifted
    recently in some areas under international pressure) has seriously limited
    Baha is freedoms and opportunities in all areas of their lives including
    divorce, inheritance, access to universities and travel. In practice,
    since 1980, thousands of Baha is have lost their jobs, pensions,
    businesses, properties and educational opportunities. By banning the Baha
    i administration including Spiritual Assemblies - the elected bodies that
    lead and administer the affairs of Baha i communities at both local and
    national levels - the Islamic Republic has denied Baha is the right to
    meet, elect, and operate their religious institutions. Further, the
    Iranian government has executed at least 200 Baha is and has imprisoned,
    tortured, and pressured to convert to Islam scores more. Because of the
    unanimous international condemnation of the persecution of this quietist,
    apolitical religious community, Iranian authorities do not always admit
    that the Baha is are being punished for their religious beliefs. There
