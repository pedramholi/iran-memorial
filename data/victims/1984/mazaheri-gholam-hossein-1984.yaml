    The execution of Mr. Gholam Hossein Mazaheri was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on May 12, 1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Mazaheri was involved in large-scale drug production and distribution,
    having contacts with drug-trafficking gangs in Hamedan, Tehran and Zahedan
    as well as international drug-trafficking gangs. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mazaheri
    s defense. Judgment The 1st division of the Islamic Revolution s Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Hamedan sentenced Mr. Mazaheri to death. Having
    been confirmed by the Islamic Revolution s Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out.
