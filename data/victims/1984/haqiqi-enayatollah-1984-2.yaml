    Mr. Enayatollah (Also Spelled "Inayatullah") Haqiqi is among the 282
    individuals listed in a United Nations Report on The Situation of Human
    Right in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Note by the Secretary General),
    published on 13 November 1985. The report lists these individuals as
    "Persons who were allegedly summarily and arbitrarily executed in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: 1984-1985." The Baha is in the Islamic Republic
    of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected
    the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest
    religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979*- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.** Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the time
    of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified and
    institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah
    Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain instances,
    even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to Iran, in
    response to a question regarding political and religious freedom of Baha
    is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated:
    They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They will
    not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they be
    free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Haqiqi's arrest and detention are not known. Trial There is no information
    regarding this trial. Charges The charges brought against the defendant
    are not known. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning
    the evidence presented against the accused. Defense No information is
    available concerning Mr. Haqiqi's defense. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the verdict leading to this execution.

    The Islamic Republic Penal Code grants no rights to Baha'is, and the
    courts have denied them the right to redress or to protection against
    assault, murder, and other forms of persecution and abuse. In so doing,
    the courts have treated Baha'is as unprotected citizens or "apostates,"
    citing eminent religious authorities whose edicts are considered to be a
    source of law equal to acts of Parliament. The Founder of the Islamic
    Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, made execution a punishment for the crime of
    apostasy and decreed that a Muslim would not be punished for killing an
    apostate.
