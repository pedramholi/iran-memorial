    The execution of Mr. Khosro Kalantari, along with 24 others, was announced
    in a communiqu by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotics Section of
    the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on August 8, 1984.. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this communiqu , Mr. Kalantari was charged with being
    consistently and actively involved in the supply and distribution of
    narcotics, possessing 42.311 kg of opium when arrested, buying and
    transporting 49 kg of opium from Zabol to Tehran and having a criminal
    record for supplying and distributing narcotics. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Kalantari s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal declared Mr. Kalantari a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to
    death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out in prison at dawn.
