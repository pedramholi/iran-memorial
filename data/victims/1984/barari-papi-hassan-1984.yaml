    The execution of Mr. Papi Hassan Barari, along with 4 others, was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on May 5, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Barari, along with two others, was charged
    with being consistently and actively involved in smuggling weapons (200
    guns)), supplying and distributing 60 kg of opium and having contacts with
    professional traffickers. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Barari s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Zahedan sentenced
    Mr. Barari to death. Having been confirmed by the Islamic Revolution s
    Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
