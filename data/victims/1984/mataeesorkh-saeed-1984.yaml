    The execution of Mr. Saeed Mataeesorkh, along with 18 others, was reported

    According to this report, Mr. Mataeesorkh was charged with possessing 16.5
    gm of heroin when arrested, selling 465 gm of heroin during 2 months,
    transporting more than 2.5 kg of heroin from Zahedan to Tehran during 3.5
    years, being convicted of supplying and distributing heroin several times.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mataeesorkh s defense. Judgment Tehran s Islamic
    Revolutionary Anti-Drug Tribunal sentenced Mr. Mataeesorkh to death. The
    sentence was carried out in Qasr prison at dawn.
