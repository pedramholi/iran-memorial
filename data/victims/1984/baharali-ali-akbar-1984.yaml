    The execution of Mr. Ali Akbar Baharali, along with 24 other individuals,
    was announced in a communiqué from the public relations office of the
    Anti-Narcotics Section of Tehran’s Public Prosecutor’s Office. The
    communiqué was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami Daily on December 9, 1984.
    Additional information has been sent to Omid by an individual familiar
    with this case via an electronic form. The official communiqué stated:
    “The Anti-Narcotics Section of Tehran’s Public Prosecutor’s Office
    declared 25 international professional drug traffickers corruptors on
    earth and issued a firm and revolutionary death sentence against them.
    These sentences were issued following the repeated warnings by the Public
    Prosecutor’s Office to the drug smugglers, these traders of death and
    partisans of the universal arrogance, to repent from their hideous acts
    and return to the humane, Islamic society of Iran. Moreover, the community
    of the party of God had recurrently asked the Islamic Revolution’s
    Tribunals for severe punishment of such persons who consciously corrupted
    the young in this country.” Mr. Baharali was born in Haji Abad village,
    near Neyshabur (in today’s Khorasan Razavi province) and was not
    affiliated with any political party or group. He worked in a car
    dealership (electronic form). Arrest and detention Mr. Baharali was
    arrested in his house in Mashhad in 1983. At the time of arrest, 30,000
    tumans cash was found in his house. He was, then, transferred to Tehran
    (electronic form). No further information is available regarding his
    arrest and detention. Trial There is no information regarding this trial.
    Charges According to this communiqué, Mr. Baharali was charged with
    “establishing an international drug-trafficking gang, possessing 5.408 kg
    of heroin and 6.332 kg of opium when arrested, selling 35 kg of heroin,
    making contacts with Afghans to supply heroin, having a previous criminal
    record for supplying, distributing and transporting drugs, supplying 30 kg
    of heroin and transporting it to Mashhad.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    electronic form mentions confessions of an unnamed person and 30,000
    tumans cash that was found in the defendant’s house at the time of arrest.
    No further information is available about the evidence of guilt.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. In the case of political detainees, these confessions are,
    at times, televised. The National Television broadcasts confessions during
    which prisoners plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and
    renounce their political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights
    organizations have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by
    those prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available
    concerning Mr. Baharali’s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal declared Mr. Baharali a “corruptor on earth” and
    sentenced him to death. The Supreme Court approved the sentence and Mr.
    Ali Akbar Baharali was hanged in Qasr prison at dawn on December 3, 1984.
