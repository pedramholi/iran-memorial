    The execution of Mr. Shir Ali Ostovari, along with 24 others, was
    announced in a communiqué by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor’s Office. The communiqué was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on April 9, 1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this communiqué,
    Mr. Ostovari was charged with “transporting more than 1.5 kg of heroin
    from Orumieh to Tehran for sale, being actively involved in the supply and
    distribution of heroin.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Evidence of guilt According to this report,
    Mr. Ostovari sold “1.5 kg of heroin to officers” Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ostovari’s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Ostovari to death. After being
    confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out at dawn.
