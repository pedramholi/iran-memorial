    The execution of Mr. Seyed Jalal Sabagh Jafari, along with 26 others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 14, 1984. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Seyed Jalal Sabagh Jafari was
    charged with being actively involved in distributing drugs and buying
    opium from armed smugglers as well as distributing more than 100 kg of
    opium. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Sabagh Jafari s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman declared Mr. Sabagh Jafari a corruptor on
    earth and sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by the Islamic
    Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in prison at dawn.
