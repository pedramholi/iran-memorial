    The execution of Mr. Nazar Kalandzari was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on May 12, 1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr.
    Kalandzari was a drug trafficker with a criminal record. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Kalandzari s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals of
    Torbat-e Jam and Kashmar sentenced Mr. Kalandzari to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Islamic Revolution s Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out at night.
