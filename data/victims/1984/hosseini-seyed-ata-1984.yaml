    The execution of Mr. Seyed Ata Hosseini, son of Seyed Ja’far, along with

    battery, possessing and drawing weapons, rape, and kidnapping.” The

    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
