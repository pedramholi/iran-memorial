    The execution of Mr. Einollah Sareh, along with 24 others, was announced
    in a communiqu by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotics Section of
    the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on August 8, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this communiqu , Mr. Sareh was charged with being
    consistently and actively involved in the supply and distribution of
    opium, dealing opium for 2 years- 20 to 30 sticks daily, selling 35 opium
    sticks to the officers when arrested, concealing 215 opium sticks, 50 gm
    of opium sap and 185 gm of burnt opium in his house and dealing 60 kg of
    opium over a period of time. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Sareh s
    defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    declared Mr. Sareh a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. Having
    been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in
    prison at dawn.
