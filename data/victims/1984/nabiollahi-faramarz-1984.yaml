    The information about Mr. Faramarz Nabiolahi is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs in the Path to Freedom , copyright 1988 by Rah-e Kargar
    Publications. He was born in Masjed-e Soleyman. During the Revolution, he
    was active as a sympathizer of the Fadayian Khalq Oranization, and in 1979
    he joined the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran-Rah-e Kargar. In
    1983, he was working in a factory in Ahvaz when he was selected as a
    representative for the workers of the factory. This execution was also
    reported in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) in 1985. The list includes 12028
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. "Rah-e Kargar" or the
    "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the summer
    of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist
    groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political
    action. They identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a
    socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed
    with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the
    Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention

    According to the book, Mr. Nabiolahi was arrested in the summer of 1984
