    The execution of Mr. Davud Ahangari (Ahangaran), along with 24 others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotics
    Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was

    Charges According to this communiqu , Mr. Ahangari was charged with being
    consistently and actively involved in the supply and distribution of
    heroin, possessing 105 gm of heroin when arrested, selling packages
    containing 50 and 100 gm of heoin over a period of time and being
    convicted 6 times. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ahangari
    s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    declared Mr. Ahangari a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death.
    Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out
    in prison at dawn.
