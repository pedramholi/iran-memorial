    Mr. Jamshid Pur Ostadkar (also spelled "Pur-Ustadkar") is among the 282
    individuals listed in a United Nations Report on The Situation of Human
    Right in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Note by the Secretary General),
    published on 13 November 1985. The report lists these individuals as
    "Persons who were allegedly summarily and arbitrarily executed in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: 1984-1985." The Baha is in the Islamic Republic
    of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected
    the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest
    religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the
    time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified
    and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention The circumstances of the
    defendant's arrest and detention are not known. Trial There is no
    information regarding this trial. Charges The charges brought against the
    defendant are not known. Because of the unanimous international
    condemnation of the persecution of this quietist (apolitical) religious
    community, Iranian authorities do not always admit that the Baha'is are
    being punished for their religious beliefs. Therefore, judicial
    authorities have often wrongfully charged Baha'is with offenses such as
    "being involved in counter-revolutionary activities," "having supported
    the former regime," "being agents of Zionism," or "being involved with
    prostitution, adultery, and immorality." Evidence of guilt No information
    is available concerning the evidence presented against the accused.
    Defense No information is available concerning Mr. Pur Ostadkar's defense.
    The representatives of the Baha'i community stress that their members are
    being persecuted for their religious beliefs. They refute the validity of
    charges such as counter-revolutionary political activities or spying
    leveled against them in Iranian courts. They point out that the
    fundamental principles of their religion require them to show loyalty and
    obedience to their government and refrain from any political involvement.
    Judgment No specific information is available about the verdict leading to
    this execution. --------------------------- 1- Slow Death for Iran s Baha
    is by Richard N. Ostling, Time Magazine,20 February 1984. Also see The
    Persecution of the Baha is of Iran, 1844-1984, by Douglas Martin, Baha i
    Studies,volume 12/13, 1984, p. 3. There is no information about the
    current number of Baha is in Iran. 2- The Islamic Republic Penal Code
    grants no rights to Baha'is, and the courts have denied them the right to
    redress or to protection against assault, murder, and other forms of
    persecution and abuse. In so doing, the courts have treated Baha'is as
    unprotected citizens or "apostates," citing eminent religious authorities
    whose edicts are considered to be a source of law equal to acts of
    Parliament. The Founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, made
    execution a punishment for the crime of apostasy and decreed that a Muslim
    would not be punished for killing an apostate.
