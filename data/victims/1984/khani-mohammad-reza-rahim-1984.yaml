    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Rahim Khani, along with 4 others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on May 5, 1984. Further information
    about this case was sent to Omid via an electronic form by a person
    familiar with the case. Mr. Rahim Khani was born in Shush, a city in the
    Southwest of Iran and was a farmer. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to
    this report, Mr. Rahim Khani, along with two others, was charged with
    “being consistently and actively involved in smuggling weapons (200 guns),
    supplying and distributing 60 kg of opium and having contacts with
    professional traffickers.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rahim
    Khani’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Zahedan
    sentenced Mr. Rahim Khani to death. Having been confirmed by the Islamic
    Revolution’s Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
