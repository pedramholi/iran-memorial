    The execution of Ms. Giti Ziad'ali, along with 24 others, was announced in
    a communiqué by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor’s
    Office. The communiqué was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on April
    9, 1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges According to this communiqué, Ms. Ziad'ali was
    charged with “establishing an international drug-trafficking gang, being
    actively involved in supplying and distributing narcotics, buying 4300 kg
    of heroin from eastern Iran and selling it in Tehran, and having contacts
    with major traffickers on the eastern borderline of Iran.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Evidence of guilt According to this report,
    Ms. Ziad'ali was “in possession of 531 g of heroin when she was arrested,
    and had a criminal record for supplying and distributing narcotics.”
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Ziad'ali’s defense. Judgment
    The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Ms. Ziad'ali
    to death. After being confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out at dawn.
