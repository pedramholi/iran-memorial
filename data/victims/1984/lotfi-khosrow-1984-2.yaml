    Mr. Khosrow Lotfi is among the 282 individuals listed in a United Nations
    Report on The Situation of Human Right in the Islamic Republic of Iran
    (Note by the Secretary General), published on November 13, 1985. The
    report lists these individuals as “Persons Who Were Allegedly Summarily
    and Arbitrarily Executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran: 1984-1985.” The
    information about Mr. Khosrow Lotfi is taken from the book The Martyrs of
    the Tudeh Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party Publications and the book
    Memoirs by Mohammad Rayshahri (the Chief Judge of the time) published by
    the Center for Islamic Revolution Documents. Mr. Lotfi was born in
    Qa’emshahr (Mazandaran province) in 1953. After graduating from high
    school, he was admitted to the mechanical engineering program at the
    Technical University of Tehran. Due to his political activity, under the
    previous regime, he was expelled from the university and sent to the
    military service in 1975. Before the Revolution, he was a leader of the
    Navid Organization (the underground organization of the Tudeh Party) in
    Mazandaran. During the Revolution, he had an active role in the arrest of
    General Riahi who was later executed. Mr. Khosrow Lotfi was executed along
    with nine other members of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was
    created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it
    supported the former Soviet Union’s policies. The Party played a major
    role in Iran’s political scene until it was banned for the second time
    following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party
    declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party’s
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The details of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Khosro Lotfi was
    arrested during a meeting in Fatemi Square in Tehran on June 3, 1983.
    Trial During his trial in Tehran, there were eight people tried along with
    him. Charges According to the book Memoirs , Mr. Khosrow Lotfi was part of
    the first row defendants in the “prosecution of the sixth group of the
    Tudeh Party members who infiltrated the armed forces.” He was tried along
    with seven others. His charges were announced as the following: “1.
    Membership in Navid underground organization “2. Being in charge of a
    military group of 15 “3. Paying the membership fee of 200 to 300 Tomans
    “4. Receiving wages and travel expenses of 3350 Tomans from the Party on a
    monthly bases “5. Gathering intelligence and secret information from
    people under his command and forwarding them to Seyed Mohammad Mo’azez,
    his party commander “6. Conducting Party meetings “7. Introducing a person
    named Hamid to join the Party “8. Cooperating and finding a place to hide
    the Organization’s weapons in the basement of a house, owned by Seyed
    Mohammad Mo’azez’s father “9. Conducting street meetings with members of
    the Organization’s secret military section” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    According to the book Memoirs , the evidence of guilt against the
    defendant is based on the statements by high ranking party members:
    “Mohammad Hadi Partovi and Seyed Mohammad Mo’azez, who were both higher
    ranking members of his Party, confirmed his charges.” Defense The
    defendant rejected some of the charges against him. According to the book
    Memoirs , he told the court that “he had no weapons to give to the party.
    He only participated in hiding the weapons of the party.” Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Khosrow Lotfi to death. He was executed by a firing
    squad on February 26, 1984.
