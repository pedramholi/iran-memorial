    Colonel Hushang Attarian is among the 282 individuals listed in a United
    Nations report on the Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran, published on 13 November 1985. The report includes a list of the
    "persons who were allegedly summarily and arbitrarily executed in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: 1984-1985." Additional information about Colonel
    Attarian’s execution was sent to the Boroumand via two electronic forms by
    persons familiar with this case. According to this information, Colonel
    Attarian, son of Ali, was born in Hamadan in 1941. He was married with
    four children. He was a colonel in the army and had played an important
    role in defending Iran during the first weeks of the Iran-Iraq war.
    According to a war report published by the regime: “Today afternoon,
    Colonel Attarian recaptured the city of Qasr-e Shirin, destroyed 80 enemy
    tanks in the west front, and our forces regained possession of a
    television and radio station.” Arrest and detention According to the
    electronic forms, Colonel Attarian was arrested at an army base and
    detained at the army’s Heshmatieh Prison. He was denied the right to
    contact his family and to have access to an attorney. Trial There is no
    information regarding this trial. Charges Based on the information
    provided in the electronic forms, Colonel Attarian was arrested for having
    a different political ideology from that of the Iranian government and was
    charged with “being an infiltrating element for the enemy” and
    “participating in a coup.” Evidence of guilt No information is available
    concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense Colonel
    Attarian was denied the right to have an attorney, and according to one of
    the electronic forms, the real reason for his execution was having a
    different political ideology. Judgment Colonel Attarian was executed on
    February 25, 1984 at the western front. His body was never released to his
    family.
