    The execution of Mr. Gholamreza Abedisir, along with 18 others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on February 15, 1984. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are

    Charges According to this report, Mr. Abedisir was charged with
    transporting 126 gm of heroin when arrested, buying heroin from Zahedan
    and selling it in Tehran during 2.5 years, being convicted of supplying
    and distributing heroin several times. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Abedisir
    s defense. Judgment Tehran s Islamic Revolutionary Anti-Drug Tribunal
    sentenced Mr. Abedisir to death. The sentence was carried out in Qasr
    prison at dawn.
