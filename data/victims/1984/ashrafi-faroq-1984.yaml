    The execution of Mr. Fareq Ashrafi, along with 21 others, was announced in
    a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s
    Office. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on March
    11, 1984. The communiqu states: the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Islamic
    Revolution s Public Prosecutor s Office sentenced 22 professional
    traffickers who were mercenaries and servants of foreigners. These firm
    and revolutionary sentences were issued in reply to the calling of the
    valiant people that scream with all of their hearts: Fight, fight, fight
    until victory! and in defiance of our second war imposed by the estekbar-e
    jahani (Universal Arrogance). Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to this report,
    Mr. Ashrafi was charged with being consistently and actively involved in
    supplying and distributing heroin, possessing 60.80 centigram of heroin
    when arrested, selling 275 gm of heroin at 3 different times as well as
    having a criminal record for supplying and distributing heroin. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ashrafi s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Ashrafi to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in Qasr
    prison at dawn.
