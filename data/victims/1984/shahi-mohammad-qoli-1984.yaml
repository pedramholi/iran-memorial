    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Qoli Shahi, along with 24 others, was
    announced in a communiqué by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor’s Office. The communiqué was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on April 9, 1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to this communiqué,
    Mr. Shahi was charged with “establishing an international drug-trafficking
    gang, being actively involved in supplying and distributing narcotics,
    buying 4300 kg of heroin from eastern Iran and selling it in Tehran, and
    having contacts with major traffickers on the eastern borderline of Iran.”
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown Evidence of guilt
    According to this report, Mr. Shahi was “in possession of 531 g of heroin
    when he was arrested, and had a criminal record for supplying and
    distributing narcotics.” Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Shahi’s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal sentenced Mr. Shahi to death. After being confirmed by the
    Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out at dawn.
