    The information about Mr. Habib Kheibari was drawn from the website of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO). He was born in Tehran. He was the
    captain of the National Soccer Team and a sympathizer of the MKO. Before
    his arrest, he was actively involved with the MKO to such a degree that
    some of his reports and letters are kept in the MKO achieve. According to
    this source, he was expelled from the National Soccer Team in 1980 because
    he was supporting the MKO. After June 20, 1981, he went underground. He
    was executed along with 40 other MKO sympathizers. The demonstrations of
    June 20, 1981, took place in protest against the parliament’s impeachment
    of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic’s systematic policy of
    excluding the MKO from the country’s political scene, the refusal of
    Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO leaders and his insistence to disarm
    them. Until that day in 1981, the MKO had supported the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and agreed to operate within the framework of the new
    political system. However, on June 20th, the MKO officially changed its
    policy and tried to overthrow the regime by organizing mass demonstrations
    all over the country. These demonstrations, which were severely
    suppressed, resulted in the killing of dozens of demonstrators. Afterwards
    there was a wave of mass arrests and executions by the Revolutionary
    Guards and para-military forces that targeted all opposition groups. The
    massive repression, unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic,
    legitimized the months-old state harassment and suppression of dissidents
    and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent political dissent.
