    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Abolqasem, along with 24 others, was announced

    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown Evidence of guilt
    According to this report Mr. Abolqasem had “prior convictions for
    supplying and distributing heroin.” Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Abdolqasem’s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Abdolqasem to death. After being
