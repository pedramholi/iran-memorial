    The execution of Mr. Gholam Hossein Bolandpaz, along with 24 others, was
    announced in a communiqué by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor’s Office. The communiqué was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on May 21, 1984. Further information about the arrest, trial and
    execution of Mr. Bolandpaz was drawn from two electronic forms sent to
    Omid by individuals familiar with this case. It is mentioned on the form
    that Mr. Bolandpaz was never given an execution sentence, rather he was
    sentenced to a 30-year prison term between 1982 and 1983. Arrest and
    detention According to the available information on the electronic form,
    Mr. Bolandpaz was arrested for drug use by the anti-narcotic task force
    between 1982 and 1983 in Tehran. He was taken to the Pol-e Rumi Committee
    and told that his friend, who was previously arrested, had told the
    authorities about Mr. Bolandpaz’s drug addiction. He was detained at Qasr
    Prison and was rarely allowed visitation with his family. Trial The
    circumstances of this defendant’s trial are not known. Charges The
    official communiqué indicates that, Mr. Bolandpaz was charged with
    “possessing 106 gm of heroin when arrested, being actively and
    consistently involved in supplying and distributing heroin and being
    convicted of the supply and distribution of narcotics as well as promoting
    prostitution.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown Evidence of guilt According to the electronic form, Mr.
    Bolandpaz’s friend had informed the authorities of his drug use. Defense
    It is mentioned on the form that although Mr. Bolandpaz was a drug user,
    he never sold drugs to others or participated in drug smuggling. It is
    stated that he had given his friend some drugs and insisted that the
    friend use the drugs only for personal reasons and not to sell it to
    others. Mr. Bolandpaz’s friend told the authorities of this transaction
    upon his arrest, and although this account appeared on Mr. Bolandpaz’s
    official file, he was still charged with drug dealing. Judgment Based on
    the newspaper report, The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    sentenced Mr. Bolandpaz to death. The sentence was carried out at Qasr
    Prison at dawn. However, it is stated on the electronic form that Mr.
    Bolandpaz was initially sentenced to a 30-year prison term, but that the
    authorities later executed him without giving notice to his family.
