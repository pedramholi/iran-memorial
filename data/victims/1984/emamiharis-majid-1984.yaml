    The execution of Mr. Majid Emamiharis, along with twenty-five others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on August 21, 1984. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Emamiharis was charged with being
    actively and consistently involved in supplying and distributing
    narcotics, addiction, promoting prostitution, organizing a prostitution
    gang, leading the youth astray and committing sodomy, encouraging the
    youth to take drugs, being convicted of addiction 14 times, transporting
    narcotics, and sodomy. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Emamiharis's defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal sentenced Mr. Emamiharis to death. The sentence was carried out
    at dawn.
