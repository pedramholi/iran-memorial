    A committed husband and parent, he assisted other families of Tehran s
    Baha i community. His sense of humor showed through in his engineering
    classes and in the classes he organized for children. The information
    about the execution of Mr. Kamran Lotfi (also spelled "Lutfi") was
    provided to the Boroumand Foundation by a relative and a friend through
    electronic forms and e-mail. Mr. Lotfi is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is
    listed in a 1999 report published by the Baha i International Community.
    The report, Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious
    Community , documents the persecution of the members of the Faith in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978.
    Additional information has been drawn from various issues of the The Baha
    i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Mr. Lotfi is
    remembered by a friend on the website Iranian.com (9 April 2008) and he is
    among the 282 individuals listed in a United Nations Report on The
    Situation of Human Right in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Note by the
    Secretary General), published on 13 November 1985. The report lists these
    individuals as "Persons who were allegedly summarily and arbitrarily
    executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran: 1984-1985." Mr. Lotfi, a
    mechanical engineer and father of a two-year old, was an active member of
    the Baha i community in Tehran, organized children s classes, and
    assisted, through the local committee (lajneh mahali), community members
    in their domestic and financial problems. Mr. Lotfi had graduated from the
    Tabriz University in 1976 and was a professor at the Semnan College of
    Technology before being dismissed in 1982 (Baha I World). He is remembered
    as a dedicated father and husband and a kind friend and cellmate. He is
    also remembered for his great sense of humor, courage, and strong belief
    in his religion. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background
    The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the
    Baha i threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national
    security in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and
    detention Based on the available information, Mr. Lotfi was arrested in a
    friend and fellow committee member s house in June 1983. After the arrest
    of two fellow committee members, Mr. Lotfi, who was concerned about his
    friend, had gone to check on him. The revolutionary guards were already in
    his friend s house and arrested Mr. Lotfi as well. They then took him back
    to his own home and, after ransacking the entire house and looking through
    books and pictures, they took Mr. Lotfi to an awaiting car. Mr. Lotfi was
    forced to carry, on his back, his personal items and the books that were
    confiscated. He was not allowed to say goodbye to his family. A cellmate
    who was later released reported that Mr. Lotfi and other Baha is arrested
    that night spent the night blindfolded in the hallways of Evin Prison,
    where they were verbally abused by the guards. . He also reported that
    during his detention, Mr. Lotfi was tortured, interrogated and beaten
    repeatedly. He was pressured by the prison authorities to recant his
    faith. Mr. Lotfi s family s did not have any information about his
    whereabouts for three months, after which they were allowed to visit him
    once a month in a room through a paned window. During their first visit,
    they noticed that Mr. Lotfi s front teeth were broken. Children were
    separated from their parents and were lined-up to go visit the prisoners.
    Mr. Lotfi s now 3 year-old son was crying and so traumatized by the fact
    that he was pulled away from
