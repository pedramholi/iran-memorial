    The execution of Mr. Ebrahim Vafadar, along with two others, was reported

    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Vafadar was charged with importing 1 kg of
    heroin repeatedly, inciting drug use among the youth and giving them free
    heroin as well as direct and indirect sale and distribution of heroin. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Vafadar s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Esfahan sentenced Mr. Vafadar to death. The sentence was
    carried out.
