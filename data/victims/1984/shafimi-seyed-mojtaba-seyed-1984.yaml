    The execution of Mr. Seyed Mojtaba Seyed Shafimi, along with twenty-five
    others, was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on August 21, 1984.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Seyed Shafimi was
    charged with possessing 633 gm of heroin and 17 gm of opium when arrested,
    buying 2 kg of heroin and selling it in 50-gram as well as 100-gram
    packages, buying 1 kg of heroin in Hamedan with the intention of selling
    it abroad, dealing 1.350 kg of heroin once and being actively involved in
    supplying and distributing heroin. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Seyed
    Shafimi s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal sentenced Mr. Seyed Shafimi to death. The sentence was carried
    out at dawn.
