    The execution of Mr. Ali Reza Khalabadi, along with 21 others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on March 11, 1984. The communiqu states: the Anti-Narcotics Section
    of the Islamic Revolution s Public Prosecutor s Office sentenced 22
    professional traffickers who were mercenaries and servants of foreigners.
    These firm and revolutionary sentences were issued in reply to the calling
    of the valiant people that scream with all of their hearts: Fight, fight,
    fight until victory! and in defiance of our second war imposed by the
    estekbar-e jahani (Universal Arrogance). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Khalabadi was charged with being
    consistently and actively involved in supplying and distributing heroin,
    possessing 2.512 kg of heroin when arrested, importing 2 kg of heroin from
    Afghanistan and selling it in Tehran through Pakistan borders as well as
    having a criminal record for supplying and distributing heroin. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Khalabadi s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Khalabadi to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in Qasr
    prison at dawn.
