    The execution of Mr. Ali Rajabi, along with 24 others, was announced in a
    communiqu by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotics Section of the
    Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the
    Jomhuri Eslami daily on August 8, 1984. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this communiqu , Mr. Rajabi was charged with possessing
    33.457 kg of antipyrine and 7.5 kg of hashish, collaboration with major
    international smugglers, dealing 112 kg of opium several times before
    being arrested, being actively involved in the supply and distribution of
    narcotics, and having a criminal record. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rajabi s
    defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    declared Mr. Rajabi a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death.
    Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out
    in prison at dawn.
