    The information about Mr. Ahmad Bashiri, son of Farajollah, is based on
    electronic forms sent to Omid by Mr. Bashiri s son, with the help of his
    prison mates. According to this information, he was born in Esfahan and
    had a Bachelor s Degree in Law from Tehran University. He was a retiree of
    the Culture Administration. He had fifty years of service in education in
    Iran and had been vice-principal of one of Esfahan s High Schools for
    years. Upon retiring from Esfahan Culture Administration, he had moved to
    Tehran and had worked as the person in charge of student affairs at Iran
    Melli (National) University School of Architecture. After the Revolution,
    Mr. Bashiri lost his job to his belief in the Baha i faith and spent the
    last years of his life defending the rights of the Baha i community in
    Iran, rights that had been denied. Mr. Ahmad Bashiri is one of the 206
    Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report, Iran s Secret Blueprint for the
    Destruction of a Religious Community , documents the persecutions of the
    members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is
    killed since 1978. Additional information has been drawn from various
    issues of the The Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986,
    Haifa 1994. Mr. Bashiri is also among the 282 individuals listed in a
    United Nations Report on The Situation of Human Right in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran (Note by the Secretary General), published on 13 November
    1985. The report lists these individuals as "Persons who were allegedly
    summarily and arbitrarily executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    1984-1985." According to people close to him, Mr. Bashiri was a true
    believer and a courageous man who had no fear of expressing his religious
    beliefs. A love for education, kindness and gentleness with his students
    were among his other major attributes. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic
    of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected
    the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest
    religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the
    time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified
    and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention According to information
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation, Mr. Ahmad Bashiri was kidnapped in
    Tehran on June 29, 1983. He had been in Tajrish Square with his wife prior
    to his arrest. Five days after being arrested, at around 6 AM, his home
    was searched by 9 armed men who claimed to have come to arrest Mr.
    Bashiri. After searching the house and frightening his family, they took
    all Baha i books and writings and left around 11 AM. Mr. Bashiri was
    incarcerated at Evin and Gohardasht prisons for 15 months. For months,
    however, the authorities expressed a lack of knowledge of his whereabouts.
    Finally, they informed his family that he was at the sanitarium section of
    Evin Prison, but is not allowed visitation as is prohibited from receiving
    money and clothes from his family. After repeated inquiries, on December
    17, 1983, that is, almost six months after his arrest, the family was
    informed that he had been transferred to Gohardasht Prison and accepted
    300 Toumans in cash and some clothes on his behalf. Some time later the
    family received a handwritten note from Mr. Bashiri for the first time,
    stating that he had received the cash from the guards office at Gohardasht
    Prison. His first telephone contact with the family was during Nowrooz
    holidays (March-April) in 1984. On May 14, 1984, the family was finally
    able to visit him after 11 months. According to the family s information,
    obtained from his prison mates, Mr. Bas
