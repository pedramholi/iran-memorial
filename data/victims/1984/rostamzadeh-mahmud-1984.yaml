    Charges According to this communiqu , Mr. Rostamzadeh was an international
    professional drug trafficker. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Rostamzadeh s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal declared Mr. Rostamzadeh a corruptor on earth and sentenced him
    to death. The sentence was carried out in prison at dawn.
