    The news and information about Ms. Nasrin Baqa i Ravari, daughter of
    Naser, is drawn from three electronic forms sent to Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center by a persons familiar with this case on 21 February and 12 March
    2009 and 09 January 2018. Her news of execution is also taken from the
    book Our Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism by Rah-e Kargar publications,
    1988. This execution was also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) in
    1985. The list includes 12028 individuals, affiliated with various
    opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the
    Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of
    the magazine. Mr. Baqa i Ravari was born in Tabriz on December 17, 1958.
    She was married and a student in the Tehran Polytechnic College. During
    the 1979 Revolution, she was a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization, but
    she joined the Rah-e Kargar Organization afterwards and became a member of
    the Central Committee for this Organization. Her husband, Hossein Qazi ,
    another member of this Organization, was also executed in 1984. Rah-e
    Kargar or the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran was established
    in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from
    various leftist groups who had rejected the idea of armed struggle and
    believed in political action. They introduced themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini s
    leadership. Arrest and detention Ms. Baqa i Ravari was arrested on Ferdosi
    Street near Berlin Alley in Tehran, along with her husband, on October 8,
    1983 and was taken to Evin Prison. In one of her memoires that was given
    to the family later, she had mentioned that she was under pressure during
    the investigations to confess and cooperate. She had also sewed several
    layers of cloths to the sole of her socks assumingly to protect her feet
    against the lashes. During her prison time, she was not allowed any
    visitation. (E-form 01/09/2018) Trial No information is available on Ms.
    Baqa i Ravari s trial. Charges No information is available on Ms. Baqa i
    Ravari s charges. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    contains no evidence provided against Ms. Baqa i Ravari. Defense No
    information is available about the defense. However, her notes from the
    prison indicates that she remained faithful to her beliefs at all times.
    Judgment According to the Rah-e Kargar book, Ms. Nasrin Baqa i Ravari was
    executed by a firing squad on May 15, 1984 at Evin Prison. Two days later,
    on May 17, 1984 her family were called to go to Evin Prison. Without any
    explanation, they were requested to transfer 17,000 Rials to a specific
    bank account. They were also given two big bags of her clothing and stuff.
    The family was also told that Ms. Baqa I Ravari was buried on section 93,
    Row 37, Number 12 of Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. The whole section was
    protected with barbed wire, and her name, last name, and date of death was
    written on a small metal plate on her grave. Alter, the family was asked
    again to pay for her new grave stone which they paid but the stone didn t
    last long and was broken into pieces by unknown people. (E-form
    01/09/2018) In her will, she addressed her family saying: I wish happiness
    and health for all you, my dears. At this moment, I am thinking of you
    more than ever and I wish you great joy and success. My dearest father and
    mother, be assured that I m not scared of this moment My only request is
    that you do not to feel sorry for me. Twenty five years of life with you
    and two years with my husband have been so precious to me that I have no
    regrets for my departure. Please don t be sad. Everybody will go at some
    point. I ask you to stay strong together and be forgiving. I ask my
    brothers and sisters to take care of my parents instead of me.
