    Mr. Mohammad Hossein Sa’adati is one of the 430 individuals whose names
    appear on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va
    Peykar. His name also appears among the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. Moreover, he is listed in a
    United Nations Report on The Situation of Human Right in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran (Note by the Secretary General), published on 13 November
    1985. The report lists these individuals as “Persons who were allegedly
    summarily and arbitrarily executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    1984-1985.” The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on Mr.
    Sa’adati’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Sa’adati’s defense.
    Judgment According to the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization, Mr.
    Sa’adati was hanged in Shiraz on May 2, 1984. He was 28 years old.
