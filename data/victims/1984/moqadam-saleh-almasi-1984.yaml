    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Almasi Moqadam s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Zahedan sentenced Mr. Almasi Moqadam to death.
    Having been confirmed by the Islamic Revolution s Supreme Court, the
    sentence was carried out.
