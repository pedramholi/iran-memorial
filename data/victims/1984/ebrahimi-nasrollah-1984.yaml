    The execution of Mr. Nasrollah Ebrahimi, along with 26 others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on July 14, 1984. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges According to this report, Mr. Ebrahimi was charged with
    collaboration with armed smugglers for 8 years as well as dealing and
    distributing several hundred kilograms of opium. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ebrahimi
    s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman declared
    Mr. Ebrahimi a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Islamic Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in
    prison at dawn.
