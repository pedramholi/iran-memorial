    The information about Ms. Zohreh (Sharareh) Filizadeh has been gathered
    from two of her former cellmates. Ms. Filizadeh studied journalism at the
    school of social communication at the Shiraz University and was a
    sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Guerilla Organization, specifically the
    Ashraf Dehqani branch. According to her cellmates, Ms. Filizadeh was very
    sympathetic, kind, and was always ready to help others. She was loved by
    other cellmates. She was steadfast in her political beliefs and never
    showed signs of weakness. The Fadayian Khalq Guerilla Organization, a
    Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Islamic
    Revolution, the organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. A
    number of the organization s members, who did not renounce armed struggle,
    founded the group The Fadayian Khalq Guerillas (the Ashraf Dehqan Branch).
    Arrest and detention Ms. Filizadeh was arrested in 1982 and was taken to
    Evin prison. During her detention, she was on the second level of Ward 240
    (later renamed Ward 4), in room number 4, assigned to the area where they
    kept leftist prisoners. She was tortured while under interrogation, and
    her cellmates state that when she came to the Ward, her feet were so badly
    wounded that she could hardly walk. Trial Ms. Filizadeh was tried twice.
    In her first trial, she was condemned to 12 years in prison. However, some
    time after the first trial, one of her cellmates who was affiliated with
    the same organization was tortured by a method known as the grave, and
    subsequently disclosed more information about Sharareh to the authorities.
    As a result, Sharareh was latter was re-tried. The grave or box was a
    method of torture where the prisoner was blindfolded and forced to sit on
    the floor between boards. The space that divided the boards was so little
    that the boards touched the legs and feet of the prisoner sitting inside,
    preventing any movement. The back of the box was open so the prisoners
    could be watched at all times. The front of the box might also have been
    open if the prisoner was positioned against a wall. While in a box, the
    prisoner was not allowed to speak. A prisoner might be forced to sit in
    this position for months. Charges The charge brought against Ms. Filizadeh
    is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Ms. Filizadeh s defense. Judgment
    At the second trial, Ms. Sharareh Filizadeh was condemned to death. She
    was executed in the spring or summer of 1984 in Evin prison.
