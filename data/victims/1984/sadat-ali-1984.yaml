    According to this communiqu , Mr. Sadat was an international professional
    drug traffiker. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Sadat s defense. Judgment The
    Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal declared Mr. Sadat a
    corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by
    the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in prison at dawn.
