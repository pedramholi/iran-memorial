    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Tayefeh Razaqi, along with 24 others,
    was announced in a communiqu by the public relations of the Anti-Narcotics
    Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was

    Charges According to this communiqu , Mr. Tayefeh Razaqi was an
    international professional drug traffiker. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Tayefeh
    Razaqi s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal declared Mr. Tayefeh Razaqi a corruptor on earth and sentenced
    him to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out in prison at dawn.
