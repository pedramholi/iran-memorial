    Mr. Shahrokh Jahangiri is among the 282 individuals listed in a United
    Nations Report on The Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran (Note by the Secretary General), published on November 13, 1985. The
    report lists these individuals as "Persons Who Were Allegedly Summarily
    and Arbitrarily Executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran: 1984-1985." The
    additional information about Ms. Shahrokh Jahangiri is taken from the book
    "The Tudeh Martyrs" by The Tudeh Party of Iran Publications and the book
    Memories by Mohammad Rayshahri (the Chief Judge of the time) published by
    the Center for Islamic Revolution Documents. He was born in Rasht.
    According to the book "The Tudeh Martyrs", he was a teacher and a taxi
    driver. He started his political activities in early 1970s. Before the
    revolution, he joined the Navid Organization (the underground organization
    of the Tudeh Party). According to the book Memories and confirmation of
    Mr. Partovi, (who was in charge of the Military Branch of the Tudeh Party
    and an advisor to the Central Committee and was present in court as a
    witness for some Party members), Mr. Shahrokh Jahangiri was the head of
    the first branch of the military, air, and navy forces of the Party. He
    was executed by a firing squad along with nine others. The Tudeh Party of
    Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist
    and it supported the former Soviet Union's policies. The Party played a
    major role in Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second
    time following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the
    Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr.
    Shahrokh Jahangiri was arrested on February 6, 1983. Trial According to
    the book Memories , the trial of this defendant took place in Tehran on
    August 14, 1983. Charges According to the book Memories , the charges
    against Mr. Shahrokh Jahangiri as the first defendant in the trial of "the
    second group of Tudeh Party members who infiltrated the armed forces",
    were as follows: "He was a high level member of the underground
    organization and an advisor to the Central Committee. He was in charge of
    the Air Force and Naval branches of the underground organization. Also, he
    was responsible for certain military personnel. His activities included:
    recruiting new members in order to expand the size of the organization;
    providing political and security guidance for the party members;
    encouraging party members to infiltrate the armed forces and make secret
    reports; receiving detailed secret military information; and collecting
    membership fees. In addition, he hid important Organization documents in
    his home, spied for the Russian Embassy in Tehran and exchanged
    information with them after a training course of six months spent in the
    Soviet Union, tried to help party members escape, and acted as a liaison
    with the Fedayian Khalq Organization (Majority)." Evidence of guilt
    Evidence of guilt against Mr. Shahrokh Jahangiri was taken from the book
    Memories including the statement of the prosecutor's witness, Mohammad
    Mehdi Partovi, the head of the underground organization of the Tudeh
    Party. Other witnesses from the prosecutor office were Nureddin Kianuri
    (Commander in Chief of the Party) and Mohammad Mo'azez. Defense According
    to the book Memories , the defendant accepted responsibility for
    leadership of the Party’s Military Branch, finding escape plans for the
    leaders, studying philosophy and English in the Soviet Union, and his
    liaison activities with the Russian Embassy and the Fedaiyan Khalq;
    however, he mentioned that "all he did was in the framework of the party."
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Shahrokh Jahangiri to death and he was
    executed by a firing squad on February 26, 1984. Addressing his wife, he
    wrote in part of his will: "My dear, forgive me for not being able to pay
    attention to you. You know that I had a difficult task trying to free
    hard-working people. I was faithful to this cause to the last minute.
    After my death, please tell my children to continue my path, the way to
    human prosperity… My dear Keyvan, my playful son, we did not have much
    time to spend together. Forgive me. I worked for a high ideal and I'm
    going to be a martyr. Follow my way. You and your brother must deserve the
    name that I put on you."
