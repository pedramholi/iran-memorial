    News of the execution of Mr. Bahman Haqiqatkhah, son of Molud and
    Rajabali, was submitted to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center via email by a
    person close to him. (February 25, 2021). News of this execution was also
    submitted to the Boroumand Center via email by an eyewitness who was
    present at the scene of Mr. Haqiqatkhah s execution. (August 11, 2021).
    Mr. Haqiqatkhah is among 282 individuals whose names appear in a 1985
    United Nations report on the situation of human rights in Iran dated
    November 13, 1985. This report includes a list entitled Persons who were
    allegedly summarily and arbitrarily executed in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran: 1984-1985. News of Mr. Haqiqatkhah s execution was also published in
    Mojahed Publication s Appendix Number 261, published by the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization of Iran, dated September 6, 1985. This Appendix
    includes the names of 12,028 individuals, mostly affiliated with political
    groups opposed to the Iranian regime. These individuals were either
    executed between June 20, 1981, until the date of publication of the
    Mojahed Publication, or killed in skirmishes with the Islamic Republic
    police forces. According to available information, Mr. Haqiqatkhah was 23
    years old, single, held a high school diploma with a concentration in
    economics, and was born in Astaneh Ashrafieh County in Guilan Province
    into a farmer family. Mr. Haqiqatkhah was popular among his fellow
    townsmen: He was kind to everybody and was very charismatic. He was
    friends with everyone in the neighborhood and had very good and warm
    relations with others. It was because of this pleasant demeanor that he
    had a great many friends in the neighborhood and in the town of Astaneh.
    He was interested in sports: He worked out every day and encouraged
    children to exercise. Mr. Haqiqatkhah joined the Mojahedden Khalq
    Organization* in 1979. He became one of the Organization s commanders
    after a while. He had to live in hiding in the jungle for a time, along
    with his friends and brothers in arm, because he had been identified by
    the Revolutionary Guards Corps operatives in his town of residence. He had
    to move to the cities of Tehran, Shiraz, and finally Tabriz because he was
    in danger of being arrested. Furthermore, he did not have any contact with
    his family. The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Arrest and detention In December 1983, Mr. Haqiqatkhah was
    identified in Tabriz by a Revolutionary Guards operative named Reza
    Khoshsirat, who was from the same town and neighborhood as he. Mr.
    Haqiqatkhah, who was armed, defended himself in a shootout with the
    Revolutionary Guards, who surrounded and subsequently arrested him. He
    spent six months in the Revolutionary Guards detention center in Tabriz.
    He underwent the most severe forms of torture at the Revolutionary Guards
    detention center in Tabriz; they even obtained a forced confession from
    him which was broadcast on Tabriz television. Mr. Haqiqatkhah s family
    finally visited with him in prison on May 19, 1984, after five years of
    separation. Trial Mr. Haqiqatkhah was tried without access to an attorney.
    There is, however, no information regarding the trial session(s). Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Haqiqatkhah is not known. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic
