    The execution of Mr. Lal Mohammad Rahmatzehi, along with twenty-five
    others, was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on August 21, 1984.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges According to this report, Mr. Rahmatzehi was
    charged with possessing 19.190 kg of heroin when arrested, selling 3 kg of
    heroin once, selling 10 kg of heroin once and being actively involved in
    supplying and distributing heroin. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Rahmatzehi s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal sentenced Mr. Rahmatzehi to death. The sentence was carried out
    at dawn.
