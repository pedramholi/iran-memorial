    The execution of Mr. Hassan Javadi Rahnamay Haqiqat, along with 24 others,
    was announced in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office.The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily
    on May 21, 1984. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant
    s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges According to this communiqu , Mr. Javadi
    Rahnamay Haqiqat was charged with possessing 1554 kg of hashish, being
    convicted 3 times (the defendant was an international professional drug
    traffickers), and being consistently involved in the supply and
    distribution of narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Javadi
    Rahnamay Haqiqat s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Javadi Rahnamay Haqiqat to death. The
    sentence was carried out at dawn.
