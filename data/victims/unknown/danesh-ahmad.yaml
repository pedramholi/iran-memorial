    Mr. Ahmad Danesh is one of 1000 people identified in a UN Human Rights
    Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and particulars of
    persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the
    period July-December 1988," published January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, "in all probability"
    there were several thousand victims. "Most of the alleged victims were
    members of the Mojahedin. However, members of the Tudeh Party, People's
    Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala Organization and 11 mollahs
    were also said to be among the alleged victims." Additional information
    about Mr. Danesh has been drawn from an electronic form sent to Omid. He
    was born in Semnan in 1930, and was a urologist. He was member of the
    Tudeh party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh Party
    ideology was Marxist- Leninist and it supported policies of the former
    Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran's political scene
    until it was banned for the second time following the August 19, 1953
    coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah Khomeini and
    the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and
    actively supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed
    the Islamic Republic, it became the target of government attacks in 1982
    when most of the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and
    detention According to the available information, Mr. Danesh was arrested
    at 4 in the morning on April 28, 1983 in his house. Trial No information
