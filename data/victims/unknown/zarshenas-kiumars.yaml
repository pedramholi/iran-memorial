    Mr. Kiumars Zarshenas was a victim of the mass killings of political
    prisoners in 1988. The majority of the executed prisoners were members of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Other victims included members or
    sympathizers of Marxist-Leninist organizations, such as the Fedaiyan Khalq
    (Minority) and the Peykar Organization, which opposed the Islamic
    Republic, as well as the Tudeh Party and the Fedaiyan Khalq (Majority),
    which did not. Information about the mass executions has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the memoir of Ayatollah Montazeri, reports
    of human rights organizations, interviews with victims families, and
    witnesses memoirs. The information about Mr. Zarshenas is taken from the
    book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party
    Publications. He was born in Amol (Mazandaran province) in 1936. He joined
    the Youth Organization of the Tudeh Party in 1951. After graduating from
    high school, he went to Austria to continue his education. He was one of
    the first activists in the Student Confederation. After the Revolution, he
    returned to Iran and served as the Head of the Youth Organization of the
    Tudeh Party. In March 1980, he became the party candidate for the Islamic
    Parliament from Amol. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The
    Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist- Leninist and it supported policies of
    the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran s political
    scene until it was banned for the second time following the August 19,
    1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared Ayatollah
    Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party s leaders and members
    were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant
    s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Kiumars Zarshenas was arrested
    by the Revolutionary Guards on February 6, 1983. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. According to existing information,
    there was no official trial with the presence of an attorney and
    prosecutor for the victims of the 1988 mass executions. Those who were
    executed in 1988 were sent to a three-man committee consisting of a
    religious judge, a representative from the Intelligence Ministry, and a
    Public Prosecutor of Tehran. This committee asked the leftist prisoners
    some questions about their beliefs and whether or not they believed in
    God. The relatives of political prisoners executed in 1988 refute the
    legality of the judicial process that resulted in thousands of executions
    throughout Iran. In their 1988 open letter to then Minister of Justice Dr.
    Habibi, they argue that the official secrecy surrounding these executions
    is proof of their illegality. They note that an overwhelming majority of
    these prisoners had been tried and sentenced to prison terms, which they
    were either serving or had already completed serving when they were
    retried and sentenced to death. Charges No information is available on Mr.
    Kiumars Zarshenas s charges. No charge has been publicly leveled against
    the victims of the 1988 mass executions. In their letters to the Minister
    of Justice (1988), and to the UN Special Rapporteur visiting Iran
    (February 2003), the families of the victims refer to the authorities'
    accusations against the prisoners accusations that may have led to their
    execution. These accusations include being counter-revolutionary,
    anti-religion, and anti-Islam, as well as being associated with military
    action or with various [opposition] groups based near the borders. An
    edict of the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini,
    reproduced in the memoirs of Ayatollah Montazeri, his designated
    successor, corroborates the reported claims regarding the charges against
    the executed prisoners. In this edict, Ayatollah Khomeini refers to
    members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization as hypocrites who do not
    believe in Islam and wage war against God and decrees that prisoners who
    still approve of the positions taken by this organization are also waging
    war against God and should be sentenced to death. Defendants, who did not
    belong to the Organization named by the leader of the Islamic Republic,
    may have been accused of being anti-religion for not having renounced his
    or her beliefs. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available about his defense. In their open letter, the families of the
    prisoners noted that defendants were not given the opportunity to defend
    themselves in court. The same letter, rebutting the accusation that these
    prisoners (from inside the prison) had collaborated with armed members of
    the Mojahedin Organization in clashes with armed forces of the Islamic
    Republic, states that such claims are false considering the circumstances
    in pris
