    The information about Mr. Abdollah Mansuri’s execution was sent to Omid
    via an electronic form by a person familiar with this case. Mr. Mansuri
    resided in Dashti (Bushehr province) until he went to Tehran to continue
    his education. He was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    Arrest and detention According to the available information, Mr. Mansuri
    was arrested in the mass arrests following the bombing of the office of
    the Islamic Republic Party. The Islamic Republic Party (Jomhuri Eslami
    Party) was formed in 1979. It was the first political party that gathered
    the most influential clergymen and laymen who shared Ayatollah Khomeini’s
    ideology. The Party was formed on the premise of fighting all
    “anti-Islamic” forces and political opposition. The Party’s organ was the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper. On June 28, 1981, an explosion at the office of
    the Islamic Republic Party caused the death of about 72 members of the
    Party. The Iranian authorities blamed the bombing on the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization, and others. In the next few years, several individuals
    affiliated with the MKO or accused of being Iraqi agents were charged with
    connections with the bombing and executed. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges There is no information
    regarding the charges brought against Mr. Mansuri. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mansuri’s defense. Judgment The circumstances of the
    execution of Abdollah Mansuri are unknown.
