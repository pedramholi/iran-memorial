    News of execution of Mr. Salim Mahmudzadeh was submitted to the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center through an electronic form on March 31, 2019,
    by one of his acquaintances. No other media sources published the news of
    this execution. Mr. Mahmudzadeh was married, had children and was from a
    low-income family. His case was related to drug offenses in the late
    1980s. Arrest and detention Mr. Mahmudzadeh was arrested by the agents of
    the Drug Control Headquarters. No further information is available on the
    circumstances of his arrest and detention. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Mahmudzadeh s trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Mahmudzadeh was Carrying Drugs . The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The evidence provided against Mr. Mahmudzadeh was 6 kilograms of
    opium . Defense No information is available on Mr. Mahmudzadeh s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Salim Mahmudzadeh was hanged in the late 1980s. When he was
    executed, his son who was born in 1988, was still a toddler.
