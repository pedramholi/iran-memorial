    The information about Mr. Sohrab Barati has been taken from an electronic
    form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. According to
    the available information, Mr. Barati had helped the brother of Mr. Mahmud
    Gholami escape from Iran. Mr. Mahmud Gholami was executed in 1981 in
    Esfehan. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Barati’s arrest and
    detention are not known. According to the available information, an
    individual from the Intelligence Ministry had put some opium in his
    vehicle, and as previously planned, was arrested by authorities who filmed
    this arrest. He claimed that the opium belonged to Mr. Sohrab Barati and
    that he was merely carrying it. This individual was later released. Mr.
    Barati was consequently arrested. Trial There is no information regarding
    this trial. Charges The charges brought against the defendant are not
    known. It appears that Mr. Barati had been charged with possession of
    drugs. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts (5 kg of hashish or
    opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone) of
    proscribed narcotics. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Barati’s defense. Judgment No
    specific information is available about the verdict leading to this
    execution. Mr. Sohran Barati was shot by a firing squad in Esfehan.
