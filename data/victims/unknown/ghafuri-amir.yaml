    Mr. Ghafuri enjoyed studying and learning. He learned computer programming
    in prison. After his release in 1991, he started working as a manager and
    a computer expert. Information about the disappearance and extrajudicial
    killing of Mr. Amir Ghafuri and his brother in law, Mr. Seyed Mahmud
    Meydani , was published in the Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e
    Hamun publication (May 9, 2008). Additional information about this murder
    has been collected from the book The Tragedy of Democracy: A Retelling of
    the Serial Killings written by Emadeddin Baghi, published by Nashr-e Ney
    (Winter 2000); Falakhan Electronic Publication #58 (February 2, 2017);
    IRANA News Service (July 28, 1994); BBC Persian Website (November 23,
    2009); Tabnak Website (October 15, 2018); and Aparat Website (January 23,
    2019). Mr. Amir Ghafuri was married, and he lived in Mashhad. He was a
    supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He was arrested in 1982 for
    his political activities. He was released from prison in 1992. Mr. Ghafuri
    was interested in studying and scientific activities. In prison, he
    studied foreign languages and computer books. When he left prison, he
    started working at a computer services company as a manager of the
    software division. At the same time, he did inspections of the computer
    section at Albasco Factory twice a week (Martial Law Weblog, quoted from
    Payam-e Hamun publication, May 9, 2008). Mrs. Mansureh Ghafuri, Mr.
    Ghafuri s sister, had an interview with Payam-e Hamun , during which she
    described the pressure put on Mr. Ghafuri by the Information Ministry.
    Whenever something happened {in Mashhad}, they would call {him and my
    husband} in. For instance, after the bombing in the Shrine of the Eighth
    Imam of the Shias, on June 20, 1994 (1), Mr. Ghafuri and his brother in
    law, Mr. Meydani, were called in to the Mashhad office of the Information
    Ministry and they were interrogated. Information Ministry agents also
    called in Mr. Meydani s wife and told her, Your husband survived the
    executions in {summer} 1989 (2). We will take care of all of them in time.
    (Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication, May 9, 2008).
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) The Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of
    Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of
    Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the
    Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic
    and social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. (3) Background of Extrajudicial Killings
    by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long
    history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world.
    Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside
    the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979, with the murder of Parviz
    Sayyah Sina, an Anglican Bishop, and have continued since then, both
    inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far
    identified over 540 extrajudicial killings outside Iran attributed to the
    Islamic Republic of Iran.(4) Dissidents have been assassinated by the
    agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran, where one of the first
    assassinations, that of a Navy Officer, Shahriar Shafiq, took place in
    Paris in December 1979. These assassinations have taken place in countries
    such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia;
    Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy,
    Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway
