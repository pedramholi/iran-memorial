    Ms. Eftekhari was a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in
    Mashhad. She was a former political prisoner, and she worked at a private
    company after she was released. Information on the disappearance and
    extrajudicial killing of Ms. Zahra Eftekhari was published in Ganji Doost
    Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication (May 9, 2008). Ms. Eftekhari
    has also been named in a report on the Mojahedin Khalq Website (December
    26, 2016). Additional information about this killing has been collected
    from Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication (May 9,
    2008); The Tragedy of Democracy: A Retelling of the Serial Killings, by
    Emadeddin Baghi, published by Ney Publishing (Winter 2000); BBC Persian
    Website (November 23, 2009); and Falakhan Electronic Publication (February
    2, 2017). Ms. Zahra Eftekhari lived in Mashhad and she was a supporter of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. In the 1980s, she spent time in prison
    because of her political activities. She was released sometime in the
    early 1990s. After she was released from prison, she worked in a private
    company (Ganji Doost Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication, May 9,
    2008) The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. (1) Forced Disappearance And
    Murder Of Ms. Zahra Eftekha Ms. Zahra Eftekhari was abducted by some
    people in a car, as she was leaving her office, in January 1997 (Ganji
    Doost Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication, May 9, 2008). While
    Ms. Mansureh Ghafuri, Amir Ghafuri s sister and Seyed Mahmud Meydani s
    wife, was following up on the disappearances of her brother and her
    husband, she became involved in the case of Ms. Eftekhari at Branch One of
    the Mashhad police department. She has said that local witnesses saw one
    of the people come out of the car, talk to Ms. Eftekhari for about 5
    minutes, first calmly, then abusively , after which he pushed her into the
    car and the car drove away. Also, someone who worked at the same company
    as Ms. Eftekhari and who was traveling to Tehran that day, saw Ms.
    Eftekhari and two other people being taken away from Mehrabad Airport in
    Tehran by private car, as he was getting off the plane. Also, according to
    Mrs. Ghafuri, the day before Ms. Eftekhari disappeared, someone went to
    the office where she worked. He asked one of the employees to point out
    Ms. Eftekhari. Then he left the office without talking to Ms. Eftekhari
    (Ganji Doost Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication, May 9, 2008).
    According to available evidence, Ms. Eftekhari was one of the supporters
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who disappeared in connection with the
    Alghadir Operation, carried out by the Information Ministry of the Islamic
    Republic. This operation was designed to kidnap and kill members and
    supporters of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. There is no information
    about him or his brother in law. Sometime before Ms. Eftekhari was
    kidnapped, thousands of prisoners, including members of the Mojahedin
    Khalq who were considered leaders , had been executed during mass killings
    in the summer of 1989 (2). According to this information and according to
    the statements given by responsible officials, it is possible that Ms.
    Eftekhari and the rest of the missing people were killed by the same logic
    (Boroumand Center Research). Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history
    of politically motivated
