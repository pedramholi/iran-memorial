    Mr. Saffar was able to achieve a double digit ranking in the university
    entrance exams. However, since he had been in prison when he was 16, he
    was rejected in the investigative stage, and was not able to go to
    university. Information regarding the disappearance and extrajudicial
    killing of Mr. Javad Saffar was published in the Martial Law Weblog,
    quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication (May 9, 2008). News of this killing
    was also published in Falakhan Electronic Publication #58 (February 2,
    2017). Mr. Javad Saffar was born in 1965 and he lived in Mashhad. He was a
    supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. In 1982, when he was 16, he
    was arrested and released from prison three years later. After he was
    released from prison he got his high school diploma in mathematics.
    Although he was able to get a double digit ranking in the university
    entrance exams, he failed the investigative part and was not able to enter
    the university. After that, he worked in a pharmacy for two years and then
    went abroad. Mr. Saffar went back to Iran after 9 years, in 1995, and he
    started to work at his brother s shop. According to Mr. Saffar s mother,
    all the time he was abroad, an official from the Ministry of Foreign
    Affairs, and also someone from the Revolutionary Guards contacted him
    regularly. In the beginning they were nice to him but later on they became
    rough. (Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication, May 9,
    2008). There is no information on the reason for these contacts. After he
    returned to Iran, Mr. Saffar was obliged to regularly check in with the
    Mashhad Information Office (Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun
    publication, May 9, 2008). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. (1) Forced Disappearance And Murder Of Mr. Javad Saffar Mr. Javad
    Saffar was abducted one morning in August 1996. He had left the house to
    go to his brother s shop. According to his mother, He had changed his
    clothes at the shop, the night before. That is why he was wearing his
    house clothes and he had slippers on. Due to the fact that the shop was
    close to their home, Mr. Saffar s family quickly figured out that had
    disappeared (Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication,
    May 9, 2008). According to available evidence, Mr. Saffar was one of the
    supporters of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who disappeared in
    connection with the Alghadir Operation, carried out by the Information
    Ministry of the Islamic Republic. This operation was designed to kidnap
    and kill members and supporters of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. There
    is no information about him or his brother in law. Sometime before Mr.
    Saffar was kidnapped, thousands of prisoners, including members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq who were considered leaders , had been executed during
    mass killings in the summer of 1989 (2). According to this information and
    according to the statements given by responsible officials, it is possible
    that Mr. Saffar and the rest of the missing people were killed by the same
    logic (Boroumand Center Research). Background of Extrajudicial Killings by
    the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long
    history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world.
    Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside
    the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed
