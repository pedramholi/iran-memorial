    Mr. Mohsen Bidgoli is one of 1000 people listed in a UN Human Rights
    Commission's Special Representative's Report, "Names and particulars of
    persons allegedly executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran during the
    period July-December 1988," published on January 26, 1989. The report
    specifies that although 1000 names are mentioned, "in all probability"
    there were several thousand victims. The report further notes that: "most
    of the alleged victims were members of the Mojahedin. However, members of
    the Tudeh Party, People's Fedaiyan Organization, Rahe Kargar, and Komala
    Organization and 11 mollahs were also said to be among the alleged
    victims." Further information was sent to Omid via an electronic form by a
    person familiar with the case. Mr. Bidgoli attended the University for
    Military Officers and was a vice-admiral in the Iranian Navy. He was also
    a member of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941.
    The Tudeh's ideology was Marxist Leninist and it supported the former
    Soviet Union's policies. The Party played a major role on Iran's political
    scene until it was banned for a second time following the August 19, 1953
    coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh declared Ayatollah Khomeini and
    the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and
    actively supported the new government. Although the Party never opposed
    the Islamic Republic, it became the target of its attacks in 1983 when
    most of the Party's leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and
