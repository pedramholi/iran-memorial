    The information about Mr. Nasroddin Qodsi has been sent to Omid through an
    electronic form by an individual familiar with this case. He was born in
    Nodeshed (Kermanshah province) and was affiliated with the Kurdish
    Democratic Party of Iran. He taught at a high school. The Kurdish
    Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with the objective to
    gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in north-west of Iran. After the Revolution,
    conflicts between the new central Shiite government and the mainly Sunni
    Kurdistan, regarding the role of minorities in the drafting of the
    constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and
    particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in armed clashes between
    the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The
    PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, when people went to polls to
    vote for or against the Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979 Ayatollah
    Khomeini called the PDKI the “party of Satan” and declared it “unofficial
    and illegal.” Mass executions and fighting broke out and continued for
    several months in the region. By 1983, PDKI had lost much of its influence
    in the region. Various leaders of the PDKI have been assassinated. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of Mr. Qodsi’s arrest and detention are
    not known other than he was arrested in Kamyaran (Kordestan province).
