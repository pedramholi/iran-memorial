    The biography of Mr. Qasem Abedini was published in the main publication
    of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class, Peykar
    , issue number 44, dated February 26, 1980. According to this report, he
    was born to a middle class family in Borujerd in 1949. He went to school
    in his birth place and then went to Tehran to continue his education and
    received his bachelor’s degree there. He was imprisoned for three months
    during the Shah’s regime for his political activities in 1971. He joined
    the separated faction of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and began his
    underground activities in January of 1976. He was a member of the military
    section of the organization and participated in the assassination of the
    American military counselors in September of 1976. After the Peykar
    Organization was established, he joined this organization. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
