    Detention The location and date of Mr. Mosta an s arrest are not known. He
    spent his detention in Section 3 of Dastgerd Prison in Esfahan. Based on
    available information, Mr. Mosta an was under a lot of pressure in prison.
    The officials and security guards at the prison were particularly
    antagonistic to him, and he was always being watched. (The Image of
    Torture) According to one of his cellmates, Mr. Mosta an always lifted the
    spirits of other prisoners. He alleviated their fears and their boredom,
    and generally made prison life more bearable for everybody. Since he was a
    wrestler, he coached the prisoners in this sport. Not only were they able
    to maintain their physical health, this discipline helped them to be more
    positive, more resilient, and more resistant in dealing with the
    difficulties of prison life. All the people in the cell participate in
    this daily regimen. Mr. Mosta an often walked alone, and during outdoor
    time, he exercised by himself. (The Image of Torture) According to one of
    his cellmates, the officials would take Mr. Mosta an for interrogation and
    torture. They were trying to get him to confess to new accusations, and
    also to get new information from him. His cellmates would worry about him.
    These interrogation sessions usually lasted for hours. When he was brought
    back to the cell, he would not be able to walk or stand. He often entered
    the cell on his knees. His face would be flushed and red, because of the
    torture. Even so, he would smile and say, They are trying to change my
    shoe size. He was alluding to the fact that his feet were swollen and
    bloody from multiple blows of the cable. According to this knowledgeable
    person, even under these conditions, he continued to coach his cellmates
    in wrestling. He would teach them the sitting moves. (The Image of
    Torture) Mr. Mosta an met with his family, before the execution. That
    night, he was able to meet with many of the prisoners, say is goodbyes,
    and embrace them. One of his cellmates says he bade farewell to his
    friends in prison, in high spirits and in a better mood than any of us
    expected . (The Image of Torture) Trial No information is available on Mr.
