    Information about Mr. Ardeshir Moqadam Qadimi has been drawn from an
    electronic form sent to Omid by a relative. He was an office in the army
    of the former regime. He started his opposition to the Islamic Republic
    since 1980. Then he went to Kurdistan and joined the Kurdish Democratic
    Party of Iran. He is one of hundreds of individuals who were
    extrajudicially executed since the 1979 revolution. In many cases, these
    killings were carried out by agents of the Islamic Republic or can
    reasonably be assumed to be the result of the Iranian government policy.
    The Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with the
    objective to gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in north-west of Iran. After the
    Revolution, conflicts between the new central Shiite government and the
    mainly Sunni Kurdistan, regarding the role of minorities in the drafting
    of the constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state
    religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in armed
    clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of
    the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, when people went
    to polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979
    Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan and declared it
    unofficial and illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke out and
    continued for several months in the region. By 1983, PDKI had lost much of
    its influence in the region. Various leaders of the PDKI have been
    assassinated. Arrest and detention Mr. Moqadam Qadidmi was never arrested
    or detained. Trial Mr. Moqadam Qadidmi was not summoned before a court,
    and no public trial was held in this case. Charges No specific charges
    were legally brought against Mr. Moqadam Qadidmi. Evidence of guilt The
    report on this assassination does not mention any evidence. Defense Mr.
    Moqadam Qadidmi was not given the opportunity to defend himself in a court
    of law before being assassinated. . Judgment No specific information is
    available about a possible verdict leading to this execution. Mr. Ardeshir
    Moqadam Qadimi was murdered. His body was never found and his family only
    received the news of his murder.
