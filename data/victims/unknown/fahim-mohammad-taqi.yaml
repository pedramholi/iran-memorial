    The information about Mr. Mohammad Taqi Fahim was sent to Omid by a person
    familiar with this case. Mr. Fahim was born in a village near Mashhad. He
    worked in the publishing house of the Kayhan newspaper in Tehran. His
    political activities were in cooperation with a section of the Fadayian
    Khalq Organization, Majority Branch, that focused on worker’s rights. Mr.
    Fahim is survived by his wife and two children. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. After the 1979
    Revolution, the organization, which renounced armed struggle, split over
    their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Majority supported and considered the Islamic Republic as a
    revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime. After the spring of 1983,
    however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely because of their
    political beliefs. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
