    Mr. Peighan claimed to be the Present Imam, because the Twelfth Imam has
    died, and is buried in the Jamkaran Well . The execution of Alireza
    Peighan was reported by Iran Newspaper (December 21, 2008), Aftab e Yazd
    Newspaper (December 23, 2008), and Ebtekar Newspaper (December 23, 2008).
    Additional information has been gathered from Deilam Website for News and
    Analysis (November 10, 2008), and Al Arabiye Website, quoting Shahab News
    Internal Website (November 11, 2008). Mr. Peighan s case has to do with
    his religious activities. According to available information, Mr. Peighan
    had claimed to be the Qa em e Al e Mohammad (the Twelfth Imam). He had
    written a book called "Al-Qa'im", based on which a number of authorities
    declared her "a corrupter of the earth" by issuing a verdict of
    "apostasy".According to available information, the arrest of Mr. Peighan
    came about as a result of a public policy that sought to curtail the
    activity of some individuals who, at that time, in the towns of Qom and
    Mashhad, were making claims of being the Twelfth Imam or having contact
    with the Twelfth Imam, or who were engaged in activities based on
    metaphysical schools of thought. According to the available reports, the
    claimants of Imamate were promoting their claims to the people citing the
    principle of Mahdism in the Shiite religion, and this issue had caused the
    religious and official authorities of Iran to worry. (Al Arabiye Website,
    quoting Shahab News, November 11, 2008). According to available reports,
    Mr. Peighan had a prior conviction for fraud and illicit relationship .
    Arrest and detention Mr. Peighan was arrested on October 26, 2006, by the
    security forces of Qom, pursuant to the complaint of the prosecutor of
    Qom, acting as the Prosecutor General. He spent more than two years
    incarcerated in the Central Prison of Qom. According to available
    information, after his arrest Mr. Peighan wrote a recantation and
    confessed to his claims being false (Iran Newspaper, December 21, 2008).
    Trial Branch 1 of the Revolutionary Court of Qom heard the charges against
    Mr. Peighan. No information is available on the details of his trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Alireza Peighan was spreading
    corruption on earth by promoting superstition and claiming to be the
    Twelfth Imam . He was accused of creating deviation in religion and
    changing the way the teachings of God are put into practice (Al Arabiye,
    quoting Shahab News November 11, 2008). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    Gathering 21 men and 29 women with the purpose of promoting superstition
    was entered as evidence in this case. Also, printing a 600-page book,
    titled Al Qa im , which was said to have been prepared for convincing
    simple people of imagined beliefs was used as evidence against him. He
    announced that since the previous Twelfth Imam had died and had been laid
    to rest in Jamkaran, he was changing the Qiblih (Point of Adoration, i.e.
    Mecca) and would now say his obligatory prayers facing Jamkaran (Al
    Arabiye, quoting Shahab News, November 11, 2008). Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Peighan s defense. Judgment Mr. Alireza Peighan was
    sentenced to death by hanging. He asked for clemency, but according to
    available information, the court officials stated that after recanting, he
    had renewed his claims in prison. Mr. Peighan was executed on the morning
    of Thursday December 18, 2008, at the Qom Central Prison (Iran Newspaper,
    December 21, 2008).
