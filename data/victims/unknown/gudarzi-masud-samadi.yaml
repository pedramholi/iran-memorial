    News of the execution of Mr. Mas’ud Samadi Gudarzi, son of Mohammad, along
    with twenty-two others, was published in the Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami
    newspapers on July 7, 1981. The Public Relations Department of the Central
    Public Prosecutor’s Office issued an announcement concerning these
    executions, the defendants' names, and their charges, and released it to
    the news agencies. This execution was also reported in the Peykar
    publication (No. 122, October 12, 1981). Mr. Samadi Gudarzi is one of the
    430 “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains
    more than 400 names of members and sympathizers of the organization who
    have been executed. According to this report, Mr. Samadi Gudarzi was a
    member of the Red Cell, a group of sympathizers of the Peykar organization
    in Kashan (Esfahan province). The Peykar Organization for the Liberation
    of the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “social
    imperialist” state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Samadi Gudarzi was arrested in June of 1981. The details of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The Public Relations
    Department of the Central Public Prosecutor’s Office announced the charges
    against Mr. Samadi Gudarzi “acting against the Islam Republic Regime,
    having a record of destructive and hypocritical activities against Islam
    and Muslims, and apostasy.” (‘Hypocrites’ is how officials of the Islamic
    Reupblic referred to individuals affiliated with the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization.) The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Samadi Gudarzi’s defense.
    Judgment َThe Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kashan called Mr. Samadi
    Gudarzi a “corruptor on earth), a rebel and at war with God.” He was
    condemned to death and executed in Evin prison on July 5, 1981. The court
    considered Mr. Samadi Gudarzi as apostate and therefore prevented the
    burial of his body in the Muslim cemetery. He was buried in the non-Muslim
    cemetery without proper ceremonies.
