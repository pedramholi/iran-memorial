    The information about Mr. Sa id Zeinali has been gathered from an
    interview with a person close to him as well as his mother s open letter,
    published on various Iranian websites in December 2009. Mr. Zeinali, son
    of Akram and Hashem, was born on September 22, 1976. He was a graduate of
    computer science school. On July 14, 1999, a friend of Mr. Zeinali named
    Shahram Cheraghi Zanjani, came to the Zeinalis house in the Punak
    neighborhood in northwestern part of Tehran. He asked to see Mr. Zeinali.
    When Mr. Zeinali was leaving the house, his mother tried to stop him,
    worried about the confrontations between students and plain-clothes agents
    at Tehran University.* Mr. Zeinali told his mother that he would be back
    soon. Still worried, she went out of the house after a few minutes. A
    neighbor told her that unidentified individuals forced Mr. Zeinali and Mr.
    Cheraghi Zanjani into a vehicle and drove away. The neighbor also gave her
    the tag number of the vehicle. At the time this arrest, Mr. Zeinali was 22
    years old. Another student, arrested in July 1999, Mr. Ahmad Batebi, who
    was detained in a solitary cell in Tohid prison, heard the voices of
    prison officials calling a young man by the name of Zeinali, whowas taken
    for interrogations and returned to solitary confinement. Mr. Batebi did
    not know the young man s first name at the time. Family s Reaction After,
    Mr. Zeinali s arrest, his parents went to numerous hospitals and police
    stations but did not find any information about him. They also contacted
    the Cheraghi Zanjani family, who were also did not know of their son s
    whereabouts. Mr. Zeinali s parents complained to Branch 11 of the
    Detective Police Station ( Agahi ). After some time, four unidentified
    agents came to the Zeinalis house, searched the house, and confiscated
    some of Mr. Zeinali s belongings. Following this event, the Zeinalis went
    back to the Detective Police Station and asked whether the agents were
    from this branch (or could use office or agency). The officials did not
    give an answer. When a special rapporteur of the United Nations visited
    Tehran, Ms. Zeinali and family members of other political prisoners
    gathered in front of Laleh Hotel where the special rapporteur stayed but
    the police dispersed the crowd. Ms. Zeinali went to the office of a member
    of Parliament from Tehran, Mr. Ali Akbar Mosavi Kho ini. He asked her to
    give him the right to act as her attorney on this matter, which she did.
    The next time she went to his office, she found out that Mr. Musavi Kho
    ini was arrested sometime betweenJune 12 andOctober 21, 2006. Or is it
    that he was detained during this time? Ms. Zeinali filed a complaint with
    Branch 6 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court. The officials asked her for
    Mr. Zeinali s birth certificate information in order to ask Interpol
    whether or not Mr. Zeinali had left Iran. They later informed Ms. Zeinali
    that her son did not leave the country and asked her to be patient. Ms.
    Zeinali went to Evin prison numerous times. She went to Khavaran Cemetery
    to ask whether her son was buried there or not. The officials did not give
    her an answer. (Many political dissidents who were executed in the 1980s,
    were secretly buried in Khavaran Cemetery, where their family members are
    not allowed to visit them.) The Zeinalis gave their vehicle to a person
    who claimed to be affiliated with the Ministry of Intelligence in order to
    obtain information about their son. However, they did not heard back from
    this person directly. Rather, the person told a family member that the
    Zeinalis should not await their son s return. This person claimed that Mr.
    Zeinali had lost his memory as a result of the torture he was subjected
    to. The Zeinalis gave money and gold coins to others who claimed they
    would be able to give them information about their son, but these efforts
    were unsuccessful. Mr. Emadoddin Baqi, the head of the Committee for the
    Defense of Prisoners Rights, was also unable to find out any information
    about Mr. Zeinali. His mother contacted the Office of the Supreme Leader,
    the Ministry of Intelligence, the Revolutionary Guards Corps, the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court, the Ministry of Interior, the Parliament, the
    Judiciary, and the Prosecution Office of Tehran, but she was unable to get
    any information about her son. After the contested presidential election
    of 2009, she contacted presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi, Mir Hossein
    Musavi, Mohsen Reza i and Abdolhassan Ruholamini, whose son also died in
    custody. She was still unable to find out any information about her son.
    Official Response About six months after Mr. Zeinali s arrest, around
    2p.m. an unidentified person phoned the Zeinalis house and asked for his
    friend named Shahram Cheraghi Zanjani and asked whether Mr. Zeinali
    listened to foreign radio stations. He also asked whether Mr. Zeinali was
    politically active. He said that he was calling from Evin prison. When Ms.
    Zeinali repeatedly asked who he was and where she could find her son, the
