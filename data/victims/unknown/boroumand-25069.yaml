province: "Tehran"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    The execution of this unnamed individual and 5 others referred to as
    members of “The Handbag Snatchers Group” was mentioned in a news piece
    regarding 7 of their collaborators who received various sentences, from
    lashes to imprisonment, from the 31st Branch of Tehran’s Appeal Court. The
    news was reported by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) and published
    in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper (June 9, 2002). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Based
    on the report, the 6 defendants were collectively charged with “forming a
    criminal group and armed robbery and handbag snatching.” The personal
    charges of this defendant were not specified. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment The defendant was sentenced to death
    and the sentence was carried out after “legal procedures” and confirmation
    by the Supreme Court. The date of the execution is not known.
