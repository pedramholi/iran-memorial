    The report of Mr. Fereidun Partovi s execution is published in the book
    entitled Parvandeye Noparvaz by the Union of Communists of Iran, in
    Germany, Summer 1994. The information about his charges and defense was
    published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on January 11, 1983. The
    Ettehadieh Komonist-ha (the Union of Communists of Iran) was created by
    exiled opponents of the Pahlavi regime who mostly belonged to the Student
    Confederation. They followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung and did not
    believe in guerilla warfare. The group became marked by ideological
    divides during the periods preceding and following the 1979 revolution
    which caused it to split into several factions. One of the most important
    rifts was triggered by the decision by a number of members to take up arms
    and take over a city in Iran. The uprising plan, devised in the midst of
    an active and violent anti-communist campaign by the revolutionary Islamic
    government, split the Union in two factions: one supporting the armed
    movement and the other opposing it. In the winter of 1982, armed members
    of the Union hid in a forest in the North of Iran (Jangal in Farsi)
    outside the city of Amol. This group, also known as the Sarbedaran-e
    Jangal , was involved in several clashes with the Revolutionary guards and
    ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of Amol hoping to generate a
    general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol failed. It is reported that a
    number of the group s members, revolutionary guards, and civilians were
    killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently, members of the Union,
    including those who opposed the Amol uprising, were arrested and tried for
    belonging to the organization and for having participated in the Amol
    clash Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial According to the newspaper report Mr.
    Partovi was tried along with 28 to 29 others between January 9th and 15th,
    1983. The trial took place at the 1st division of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran with Ayatollah
    Mohammadi Gilani as the residing judge. Charges Mr. Partovi s indictment
    was read to him by Asadollah Lajevardi, Tehran s Public Prosecutor. The
    text of this indictment is as follows: being a member of the Editorial
    Board of [the Union of Communists of Iran], being in charge of the News,
    as well as the Advertisement Committee in the Union; that is, preparing
    the pamphlets, publications and manifestos of the Union... He was also
    charged with providing the members of the Publicity Committee with his
    house, as well as destroying the documents of the Union. Moreover, he had
    been the news correspondent for the publications section in the Union and
    had provided the news for the Editorial Board and the magazine; hence he
    had a special role in leading the Iranian youth astray. The Islamic
    Revolution s Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran contended that Mr.
    Partovi s culpability was indisputable, and therefore asked for the
    maximum penalty possible. Evidence of guilt According to the report, Mr.
    Partovi confessed: After the beginning of the war, I went to Abadan and
    reported on the people s resistance against the Iraqis. This report was
    published in the Haqiqat magazine. Defense The report mentions that Mr.
    Partovi did not dispute his charges. Judgment The report of Mr. Partovi s
    execution is published in the Parvandeye Noparvaz , but this report does
    not contain the date or the place of his execution.
