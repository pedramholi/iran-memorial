    After he was released from prison in 1993, Mr. Alian worked in a flower
    nursery in Mashhad. Information on the disappearance and extrajudicial
    killing of Mr. Morteza Alian Najafabadi has been published in Martial Law
    Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication (May 9, 2008). Additional
    information about this killing has been collected from The Tragedy of
    Democracy; A Review of the Serial Killings, written by Emadeddin Baghi,
    published by Ney Publishing (Winter, 2000) and Falakhan Electronic
    Publication #58 (February 2, 2017). Mr. Morteza Alian Najafabadi lived in
    Mashhad and was a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. He was
    arrested in 1985 for his political activities. He was initially condemned
    to life in prison, but he was released in 1993. After he was released from
    prison, he worked in a flower nursery (Martial Law Weblog, quoted from
    Payam-e Hamun publication, May 9, 2008). In her interview with Payam-e
    Hamun publication, Mr. Alian s mother said that after the bombing incident
    in the Shrine of the Eighth Imam of the Shias on June 20, 1994 (1), Mr.
    Alian was summoned by the Information Ministry and he was interrogated. At
    the time, Mr. Alian s family had been told, We will be back to take him in
    again. (Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication, May 9,
    2008) The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. (3) Forced Disappearance And
    Murder Of Mr. Morteza Alian Najafabadi Mr. Morteza Alian Najafabadi left
    his home at 9 am, on Friday, January 14, 1997. He was going to drive to
    the flower nursery where he worked. He never returned home. According to
    available information, he was abducted that same day by agents of the
    Information Ministry (Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun
    publication, May 9, 2008; The Tragedy of Democracy, Winter 2009; Falakhan,
    February 2, 2017). According to available evidence, Mr. Alian was one of
    the supporters of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who disappeared in
    connection with the Alghadir Operation, carried out by the Information
    Ministry of the Islamic Republic. This operation was designed to kidnap
    and kill members and supporters of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. There
    is no information about him or his brother in law. Sometime before Mr.
    Alian was kidnapped, thousands of prisoners, including members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq who were considered leaders , had been executed during
    mass killings in the summer of 1989. According to this information and
    according to the statements given by responsible officials, it is possible
    that Mr. Alian and the rest of the missing people were killed by the same
    logic (Boroumand Center Research). Background of Extrajudicial Killings by
    the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long
    history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world.
    Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside
    the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979, with the murder of Parviz
    Sayyah Sina, an Anglican Bishop, and have continued since then, both
    inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far
    identified over 540 extrajudicial killings outside Iran attributed to the
    Islamic Republic of Ir
