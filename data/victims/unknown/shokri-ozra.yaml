    The information about Ozra Shokri was provided by a friend who worked for
    the same political organization and who was kept in the same prison at the
    same time as Ms. Shokri. She was born in Qaemshahr and lived there. She
    was a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly
    in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and detention Ms.
    Shokri was arrested in 1982 or 83 in either Sari or Qaemshahr, both in the

    are not known. Trial No information is available on the trial. Charges The
    charge brought against the defendant is not known. Evidence of guilt The

    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense Ms. Shokri defended her
    political beliefs during the interrogations and at the trial. Judgment

    Shokri was executed soon after her arrest. She was about 20 years old.
