    Less than ten years after the killings of the summer of 1988, Mr.
    Varzeshnama, a former political prisoner, had gone to the bank on official
    business, when he was abducted and killed by agents of the Information
    Ministry. According to available information, Mr. Varzeshnama was an MKO
    supporter who disappeared within the framework of a program within the
    Islamic Republic s Ministry of Information called Al-Ghadir, designed to
    kidnap and kill MKO members and supporters. There is no information
    regarding him and other travelers who had fallen into the trap the
    Ministry of Information had set up for them to join the MKO in Iraq.
    Available investigations and research shows that Mr. Varzeshnama and many
    others that were kidnapped under this program, never reached MKO s camps
    in Iraq. A few years prior to Mr. Varzeshnama s kidnapping, thousands of
    prisoners, including members of the MKO, who were considered to be
    maintaining their [ideological] stance , had been executed in the course
    of the Summer of 1988 mass killings. According to available information
    and the statements of Iranian officials, it is possible that Mr.
    Varzeshnama and others who disappeared were killed on the basis of that
    same logic. Remarks Information on the abduction and killing of Mr.
    Siavash Varzeshnama was obtained from an interview conducted by
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with Mr. Iraj Mesdaqi, a Human Rights
    activist and a friend of Mr. Varzeshnama (August 26 and 30, 2022).
    Information about this killing has also been published in the Mojaehdin
    Khalq Organization website (December 26, 2016) and the Freedom of
    Expression website (August 17, 2019). Mr. Varzeshnama, born in 1964 or
    1965, was a supporter of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO).
    (Boroumand Center interview, August 26, 2022). He spent part of the 1980s
    in prison. Sometime after the killings of 1988, he was released from Evin
    Prison in the summer of 1988 (1) (MKO). After he was released from prison,
    Mr. Varzeshnama settled in Shiraz and was employed as an account collector
    at a company (Boroumand Center interview, August 26, 2022; MKO website).
    The Mojahedin Khalq Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
    was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of Islam as
    its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam
    was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s
    regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic and
    social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to the
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to reorganize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. (1) Background of Extrajudicial Killings
    by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long
    history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world.
    Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside
    the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since
    then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has
    so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases, there has not been much published, and
    local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
