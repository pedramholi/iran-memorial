    Mr. Meidani was a responsible person. He was family oriented and
    hardworking. He was a building contractor and he really liked what he did.
    Information about the disappearance and extrajudicial killing of Mr. Seyed
    Mahmud Meidani and his brother in law, Mr. Amir Ghafuri , was published in
    the Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication (May 9,
    2008). Additional information about this murder has been collected from
    the book The Tragedy of Democracy: A Retelling of the Serial Killings
    written by Emadeddin Baghi, published by Nashr-e Ney (Winter 2000);
    Falakhan Electronic Publication #58 (February 2, 2017); IRANA News Service
    (July 28, 1994); BBC Persian Website (November 23, 2009); Tabnak Website
    (October 15, 2018); and Aparat Website (January 23, 2019). Mr. Seyed
    Mahmud Meidani, resident of Mashhad, was a supporter of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization. He was arrested in 1982 for his political activities,
    and he was released in 1992. He got married in 1992, and he had a child.
    He did not have political activities after he was released, and he worked
    as a building contractor. According to Mrs. Mansureh Ghafuri, Mr. Meidani
    s wife, he enjoyed his job, and sometimes he even worked during the
    weekend (Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication, May 9,
    2008). In an interview with Payam-e Hamun , Mrs. Ghafuri said, Whatever
    happened {in Mashhad}, they would summon him. After the bombing incident
    in the Shrine of the Eighth Imam of the Shias in Mashhad, on June 20, 1994
    (1), Mr. Meidani was summoned to the Information Ministry in Mashhad and
    he was interrogated. Information Ministry agents also summoned Mr. Meidani
    s wife and told her, Your husband escaped the {summer} 1989 executions
    (2). We will take care of all of these in time. (Martial Law Weblog,
    quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication, May 9, 2008) After his wife s
    brother Mr. Amir Ghafuri disappeared on January 21, 1997, Mr. Meidani had
    told her that a white Paykan car with three occupants was following him
    wherever he went. He was so worried, he moved to his mother in law s home
    and did not go to work until Naw Ruz 1997. However, he had work
    obligations, so he went back to work. Up until April 8, 1997, Mr. Meidani
    was driving back and forth to work with his coworker (Martial Law Weblog,
    quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication, May 9, 2008). According to Mr.
    Meidani s wife, he was a responsible person. He was family oriented and
    hardworking (Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun publication,
    May 9, 2008). The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the
    principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In
    January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released
    along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize the MKO
    and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979
    Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted
    the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active
    participation in the political scene and infiltration of governmental
    institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first
    two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous
    sympathizers, especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts
    to gain political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly
    opposed by the Islamic Republic leaders. (2) Forced Disappearance And
    Murder Of Mr. Seyed Mahmud Meidani In the evening of April 8, 1997,
    between 4 7 pm, Mr. Seyed Mahmud Meidani was abducted from his building
    project in Mashhad (Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Hamun
    publication, May 9, 2008; Falakhan #58, February 2, 2017). He called his
    home at 4 pm from work and told his wife that he would come home early
    because of the electricity being cut off. The coworker who had been
    driving him back and forth had left earlier, due to an official
    obligation. Since Mr. Meidani had not yet shown up at home at 7 pm, his
    wife went to the building project to see what had happened. One of the
    workers told Ms. Ghafuri, {Mr. Meidani} was waiting for a taxi on that
    side of the street. A car braked in front of him, they forced him in and
    drove off. (Martial Law Weblog, quoted from Payam-e Ham
