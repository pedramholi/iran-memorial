    Mr. Hushang Eqbali’s name has been sent to Omid via an electronic form by
    an individual close to him. According to this form, he was affiliated with
    the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over the support
    to the Islamic Republic and to the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was mainly active in the
    political arena and the labor movement. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority
    considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist
    regime and supported it. It shared the views of the Tudeh Party and
    collaborated with the government. By 1983, however, its political beliefs
    made its supporters the target of the Islamic Republic’s repression.
