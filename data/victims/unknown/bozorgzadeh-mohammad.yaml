    Information on the murder of Mr. Mohammad Bozorgzadeh was published on the
    official website of the Judiciary - Mizan News Organization - on December
    5, 2014. Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of
    Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of politically
    motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Ever since the 1979
    Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the country
    have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of
    individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of
    the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however,
    these murders began in February 1979, and have continued during the
    existence of the Islamic Republic both inside and outside Iran. The
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has identified over 540 murders outside Iran
    attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. (1) Opponents of the Islamic
    Republic have been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic in
    various ways outside Iran, in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases, not much information has been published
    about these murders and local officials have not issued any arrest
    warrants. Documentation, evidence, and traces obtained through
    investigations conducted by local police and judicial authorities confirm,
    however, the theory of state committed crimes. In certain cases, these
    investigations have resulted in the expulsion (The Netherlands, 2018) or
    arrest (Brussels, 2020; Turkey, 2021) of Iranian diplomats. In limited
    cases outside Iran, the perpetrators of these murders have been arrested
    and put on trial (Paris 1980 and 1991) and the evidence presented,
    revealed the defendants connection to Iran s government institutions, and
    an arrest warrant (the Mikonos Trial in Germany) has been issued for Iran
    s then-Minister of Information. The manner in which these killings were
    organized and implemented in Iran and abroad, is indicative of a single
    pattern which, according to Roland Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor,
    contains common parameters and detailed planning. It can be ascertained
    from the similarities between these murders in different countries that
    the Iranian government is the principal entity who ordered the
    implementation of these crimes. (2). Iranian authorities have not
    officially accepted responsibility for these murders and have even
    attributed their commission to their opposition. Nevertheless, since the
    very inception of the Islamic Republic regime, the Islamic Republic
    officials have justified these crimes from an ideological and legal
    standpoint. In the spring of 1979, Sadeq Khalkhali, the first Chief Shari
    a Judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts, officially announced the
    regime s decision to implement extrajudicial executions, and justified the
    decision: These people have been sentenced to death; from the Iranian
    people s perspective, if someone wants to assassinate these individuals
    abroad, in any country, no government has any right to bring the
    perpetrator to trial as a terrorist, because such a person is the
    implementing agent of the sentence issued by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court. Therefore, they are Mahduroddam ( one whose blood may be spilled,
    whose life can be taken, without the perpetrator incurring any punishment
    ) and their sentence is death regardless of where they are [and where you
    find them]. More than 10 years after these proclamations, in a speech
    talking about the security forces success, Ali Fallahian, the regime s
    Minister of Information stated the following regarding the elimination of
    members of the opposition: We have had success in inflicting damage to
    many of these little groups outside the country and on our borders.
    (Speech broadcast on the state-run Iranian Radio and Television on August
    31, 1992, quoted from Asr Iran, August 17, 2006; and Ali Arabshahi
    Facebook Page, June 17, 2013). Extrajudicial killings have rarely been
    legally followed up on in Iran. The few murders that were followed up on
    in 1998 and came to be known as the Serial Murders (3) have brought to
    light the involvement and responsibility of the country s Information
    officials. Several Ministry of Information agents who were defendants in
    the Serial Murders case, confirmed the existence of a long term government
    policy of extrajudicial killings and emphasized that there was planning on
    an annual basis to carry out these executions, that there was a budget
    allocated and there were objectives set, and those who participated in the
    murders were commended. In a lecture given at [the city of] Hamedan s Bu
    Ali University in 1996, Sa eed Emami, Ministry of Information Deputy
    Minister for Security Affairs and one of the principal defendants in the
    Serial Murders case
