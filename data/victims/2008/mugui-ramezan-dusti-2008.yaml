    The execution of Mr. Ramezan Dusti Mugui, along with four other people,
    was reported by Fars News Service and ISCA News Website (January 30, 2008)
    and Tehran e Emrooz Newspaper (January 31, 2008). Additional information
    on this case was gathered from Shargh Newspaper (June 15, 2005 and
    February 7, 2006) and Iran Newspaper (June 15, 2005).Mr. Dusti Mugui was
    about 30 years old and lived in Tehran. His case was related to the death
    of his brother s wife, after a fall from the fifth floor of the building
    they lived in, on Molavi Street. Arrest and detention Mr. Dusti Mugui was
    arrested in a hotel in Tabriz, a few days after the incident leading to
    the death of his brother s wife. Police were investigating the death of a
    woman who had fallen from a building in Molavi Street in Tehran, at 1 pm,
    on April 5, 2004. They found out that at the time of the incident, the
    woman had been at home with her husband s brother. When they found out
    that the brother-in- law had not been at the funeral of this woman, they
    decided to pursue him as a suspect. A few days later, police found and
    arrested Mr. Dusti at a hotel in Tabriz. He spent three years in prison.
    Trial The judiciary panel at Branch 74 of the Criminal Court of Tehran
    Province tried Mr. Dusti on June 8, 2005. Mr. Dusti testified in court
    that he had become suspicious of his brother s wife. She would leave the
    house for several hours, after her husband had left, and would return
    before he was due to return home. This behavior caused Mr. Dusti to
    suspect that she was having relations with other men. On the day of the
    incident, he confronted her and they were arguing. During the altercation,
    he became angry and grappled with her. The parents of the victim asked for
    the suspect to be executed in retaliation for their daughter s death.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Dusti was murder in the first
    degree . He was accused of killing his brother s wife with blows from a
    knife, and throwing her out of a fifth floor window. Evidence of guilt Mr.
    Dusti confessed to killing his brother s wife when he was angry. The
    Coroner confirmed that the victim had sustained two knife blows to the
    chest and side. Defense Mr. Dusti was suspected to be suffering from
    psychosis/schizophrenia . His brother tried to bring this to the attention
    of the court, to no avail. Mr. Dusti confessed to the murder in a state of
    rage, expressed remorse, and asked for clemency. Judgment Mr. Ramezan
    Dusti Mugui was sentenced to death by hanging (Retaliation for Taking a
    Life), on June 8, 2005. Branch 26 of the Supreme Court approved this
    sentence. Mr. Dusti Mugui was executed at Evin Prison on Wednesday, Jan
    30, 2008.
