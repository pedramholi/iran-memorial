    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Abedini Sar, along with four other people,
    was reported by Fars News Service and ISCA News, on January 30, 2008. In
    these sources, his name is given as Mohammad S. . Additional information
    about this case has been gathered from the Human Rights Activists for
    Democracy Weblog (January 29, 2008). Mr. Abedini Sar was 32 years old,
    lived in Tehran, and his job was taxi driving. His case was related to the
    murder of one of his passengers, in the vicinity of Islam Shahr, on August
    13, 1998. Arrest and detention Sometime after August 1998, Mr. Abedini Sar
    was arrested by police, while he was cashing some traveler s checks. He
    spent nine years in prison. Trial Branch 74 of the Criminal Court of
    Tehran Province tried Mr. Abedini Sar. No information is available on this
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Abedini Sar was murder in
    the first degree . He was accused of killing one of his passengers, with
    the intent of stealing his money. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offenses, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    traveler s checks found on Mr. Abedini, at the time of his arrest, were
    entered as evidence against him. During police investigations, he
    confessed to the murder. According to available information, he said he
    had started talking with his passenger. During the conversation, he
    realized that the man was carrying a large amount of traveler s checks. He
    was tempted to steal these, and that was why he killed the man.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress . Defense No information is available on Mr. Abedini Sar s
    defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Mohammad Abedini Sar to death by
    hanging (retaliation for taking a life). One day before his execution, he
    was taken from Raja i Shahr Prison to Evin Prison. Mr. Abedini Sar was
    executed, along with several other people, on January 30, 2008, in Evin
    Prison.
