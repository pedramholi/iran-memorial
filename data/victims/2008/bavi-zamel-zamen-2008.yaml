    Mr. Bavi always helped out friends, people in need, and families of
    political prisoners. Although all his brothers were older than him, but
    they were all known as Zamel's brothers in the prison. News of Mr. Zamel
    (Zamen) Bavi s execution was published in numerous sources, including
    Amnesty International (February 6, 2008), Ahvaz Human Rights Organization
    (January 30, 2008) and the European Parliament (January 30, 2008).
    Additional information was obtained from an interview conducted by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF interview) with two individuals
    accused in the case, which has been referred to as the Ahvaz bombings case
    by Iranian authorities, including one of his prison mates, an ethnic Arab
    human rights activist, and from other sources.* Mr. Zamel Bavi was a
    29-year-old high school graduate, married, with a two-year-old child. He
    resided in [the city of] Ahvaz and had a grocery distribution store.
    According to people close to him, Mr. Bavi had extensive social relations.
    He always helped out friends, people in need, and families of political
    prisoners. He was an athlete, active in Tae Kwon Do and track and field,
    and was always happy and in good spirits, even in difficult circumstances.
    He did not belong to any political groups or organizations. He was the son
    of Mr. Salem Bavi, one of the leaders of the tribe and an influential
    philanthropist among Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arabs. The Bavi family
    has had numerous social and cultural activities, with the aim of keeping
    the Ahvazi Arabs ethnic identity alive. For instance, Mr. Zamel Bavi s
    wedding was performed according to ancient Arab traditions and, in the
    presence of a great crowd, attracting the attention of the region s Arab
    population and local media, as well as alerting the security apparatus.
    (ABF interview). According to Mr. Bavi's cellmates, he was popular and
    respected among the prisoners and would financially assist those in need.
    Although all his brothers were older than him, but they were all known as
    Zamel's brothers in the prison. Mr. Bavi used to study Arabic and attend
    Qoran classes in prison (ABF interview). The arrest of eight members of
    the Bavi family (five brothers, the son-in-law, and the head of the
    family, i.e. the father) and issuing tough sentences for the Bavi
    brothers, including a death sentence for Mr. Zamel Bavi, caused numerous
    reactions. The sentence and execution issued for him prompted numerous
    reactions from the attorneys in the case, the Association for the
    Protection of Prisoners Rights, as well as international organizations
    such as Amnesty International (May 17 and June 23, 2006) and Human Rights
    Watch (June 26 and November 11, 2006). In a resolution issued on December
    19, 2006, the UN General Assembly expressed grave concern about widespread
    human rights abuses, the use of torture and execution in Iran, and, more
    particularly, regarding discrimination against ethnic and religious
    minorities. The open publication of seven of the Ahvaz bombing defendants
    attorneys resulted in their prosecution on the charge of endangering
    national security in Ahvaz. (ILNA, October 7, 2006). The attorneys trial
    was supported by the UN Special Rapporteurs objections. (UN website,
    January 10, 2007). On January 31, 2008, the European Parliament strongly
    condemned the execution of four Arab political activists, including Mr.
    Bavi. Historical Background of the Ahvaz Bombing Subsequent to the
    publication of a letter ascribed to a government official concerning
    systematic modification of the fabric of Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab
    population, demonstrations broke out on Friday, April 15, 2005, in [the
    city of] Ahvaz, and then in [the town of] Hamidideh. In quashing the
    demonstrations, security and police forces resorted to violence, which led
    to the death and injury of dozens of protestors and resulted in the
    protests and the unrest spreading to a number of other Khuzestan cities,
    continuing for at least 10 days.**These protests were the beginning of a
    series of incidents, including widespread arrests, multiple bombings, and
    successive executions in Ahvaz. For instance, a series of bombings
    followed on June 12 and October 15, 2005, and on January 24 and February
    27, 2006, in various regions of Ahvaz, Abadan, and Dezful. These bombings
    were carried out in front of government buildings and in public places and
    left in their wake more than 20 dead and dozens injured.***According to
    government sources, other bombings (targeting oil pipelines and
    non-residential regions around Ahvaz) occurred at the end of summer and in
    the fall of 2005, which did not leave any casualties. In response to the
    Ahvaz bombings, security forces arrested dozens of the region s ethnic
    Arab individuals, charging them with participation in the bombings. They
    were then kept in solitary confinement cells, for months, at the
    Information Ministry s Detention Center. People being held were subjected
    to torture, in order to confess having taken part in the bom
