    News of the execution of Mr. Abolfazl B., along with another person, was
    published in the E temad newspaper and on the website of ISNA (Iranian
    Students News Agency) on February 17, 2008, quoting the Public Relations
    Office of the Khorasan-e Razavi Courthouse, and in the Khorasan newspaper
    on February 25, 2008. Additional information was taken from the Qods
    newspaper on January 28, 2008, Khabar-e Jonub on May 31, 2008, and the
    Khorasan newspaper on February 20 and March 3, 2008. His case is related
    to the rape and harassment of eight under-10-year-old girls at Eshratabad
    Street and Khajeh Rabi quarters in Mashahd during a year. He was 18 at the
    time of incidents. Arrest and detention Mr. Abolfazl B. was arrested by a
    security force soldier in Hosseinbashi Alley in Mashhad on October 13,
    2006 and transferred to the Shahid Hasheminejad Police Station. According
    to the existing information, a person reported to this police station that
    his daughter had been kidnapped by a bicyclist. Police agents, accompanied
    by the plaintiff, began an immediate search and identified the bicyclist
    and the young girl. During preliminary interrogation, Mr. Abolfazl B.
    denied the charge. However, he later confessed to the kidnapping and
    raping of girls. (Khorasan newspaper) Trial Branch Five of the Criminal
    Court of Khorasan-e Razavi tried Mr. Abolfazl B. A judge in Branch 27 of
    the Revolutionary Public Prosecutors Office first investigated the case
    and referred it to the Criminal Court of Khorasan-e Razavi on October 23,
    2006. The first trial session took place on February 7, 2007; however, it
    was postponed to the next day because there was no attorney and Mr.
    Abolfazl B. denied the charges. The second trial session took place in the
    presence of a public defender, the representative of the Public
    Prosecutor, and several plaintiffs. Next sessions took place on April 13
    and May 1, 2007. (Khorasan newspaper on February 25, 2008) Charges
    According to the Public Relations Office of the Khorasan-e Razavi
    Courthouse, the charge brought against Mr. Abolfazl B. was announced as
    raping under-10-year-old girls (ISNA). According to another report, his
    charges were announced as kidnapping young girls, harassment, and raping
    them. (Khorasan newspaper) The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Abolfazl B. was being identified by girls
    and their testimonies, statements and complaints by families, and his own
    confession. Additionally, the forensics report of an interview and a
    psychological test indicated that no sign of insanity had been observed
    and he had been in control of his actions during the crime. International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    Mr. Abolfazl B. was 18 years old at the time of incidents. He told the
    court that he was innocent and was forced to accept charges because of
    psychological and physical pressures on him (Khorasan newspaper). In his
    defense, Mr. Abolfazl B. s attorney stated that he suffers from a kind of
    psychological illness and demanded that the case be referred to the
    Supreme Court for evaluation. (Khabar-e Jonub) Judgment Branch Five of the
    Criminal Court of Khorasan-e Razavi condemned Mr. Abolfazl B. to death by
    hanging. Branch 32 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged, along with another person, observing of religious orders, in the
    presence of authorities and a forensics physician at the Mashhad Central
    Prison yard on February 16, 2008.
