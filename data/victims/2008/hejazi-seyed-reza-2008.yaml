    News of the execution of Mr. Seyed Reza Hejazi was published in the E
    temad Melli newspaper and on the website of Ebrat news agency on August
    19, 2008, and in the Kargozaran newspaper on August 20, 2008. Additional
    information was taken from interviews with his brother and his attorney by
    the Voice of America on August 18, 2008, his attorney s interview with the
    Deutsche Welle website on August 20, 2008, Mohammad Mostafavi s weblog on
    August 18 and 19, 2008, and the E temad Melli newspaper on September 1,
    2008. His case was related to the murder of an adolescent boy at Isargaran
    Park in Esfahan during a collective fight on September 19, 2003. Mr.
    Hejazi was 15 years old at the time of the incident. In objecting to the
    execution of Mr. Hejazi, and for pursuing a pardon from the victim s
    family, many efforts were made. Additionally, over one thousand people
    from all parts of the society wrote a letter to the Head of Judiciary
    objecting to the execution of adolescents. (E temad Melli newspaper)
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention
    on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Hejazi was arrested, along with others who participated in
    the fight, after a police investigation. According to his brother, Mr.
    Hejazi was beaten to confess during the interrogation, and his foot was
    blackened because of lashes (his brother s interview with Voice of
    America). He was detained for five years. He was transferred to solitary
    confinement on August 18, 2008 when he visited his family for the last
    time. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Branch 106 of the Criminal Court of Esfahan tried Mr. Hejazi. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Hejazi was announced as murder. According to the existing reports, he
    and his friends went to a park for recreation when two individuals were
    fighting. When they tried to separate them when someone was stabbed and
    died after being transferred to the hospital. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Hejazi was his confession, the forensics report, and the complaint by the
    victim s parents. Additionally, his participation in a similar charge in
    the past was also considered in evidence against him. (Ebrat news agency)
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense Mr. Hejazi was younger than 18 when the incident
    occurred. According to his attorney, the death penalty for those who
    commit a crime when they are under 18 years old is not legal. The murder
    took place in a collective fight and was not planned. Also, the defendant
    stated that he did not intend to kill during all investigation sessions.
    During the early period of the investigation, Mr. Hejazi was denied access
    to an attorney due to financial restrictions and had to have a public
    defender; however, he was able to select his attorney when the case was
    referred to the Head of judiciary. Mr. Hejazi objected to the ruling and
    his case was referred to Branch 28 of the Supreme Court located in
    Mashhad. But the judges of this branch confirmed the ruling without paying
    attention to his age and the fact that the Children s Court must try him.
    (his brother s interview with Voice of America and Mohammad Mostafavi s
    weblog). Judgment Branch 106 of the Criminal Court of Esfahan condemned
    Mr. Seyed Reza Hejazi to death based on Section B of Article 206 of the
    Islamic Penal Code. Branch 28 of the Supreme Court and the Head of
    Judiciary confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in Esfahan Central Prison on
    August 18, 2008 at 11 a.m. According to his attorney, he and his family
    were not informed. On the day of his execution at 8 a.m. when the attorney
    and the family of Mr. Hejazi went to the Esfahan Prison, the
