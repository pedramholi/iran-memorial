    News of the execution of Mr. Hamid Reza Qadimi was published on the
    websites of Esfahan General Courthouse, the E temad Melli newspaper, the
    Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran, and Ebrat News Base on July
    2, 2008. He was from Daran near Faridan in Esfahan. His case was related
    to the murder of an individual in Daran on May 22, 2006. Mr. Qadimi was
    only 17 years old when the incident occurred. International laws have
    strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the
    age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the
    Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence
    committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention On May 22,
    2006, Mr. Qadimi went to the local police station in Daran and claimed
    that he had stabbed a friend with a knife during a fight and transferred
    him to the hospital. The Deputy Sheriff arrested him after hearing his
    statement. He was detained for two years. (E temad Melli newspaper) Trial
    Branch 17 of the Criminal Court of Esfahan tried Mr. Qadimi. A judge and
    four advisors were present during the trial. No information is available
    on his trial. (E temad Melli newspaper) Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Qadimi was announced as murder. He had killed the victim by stabbing
    him in the chest. (Esfahan General Courthouse) The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Qadimi was his confession during interrogation and trial, questioning the
    witnesses, forensics report, and having a criminal record. In his
    confession, Mr. Qadimi stated that the victim came to his house demanding
    five thousand Tumans debt on the day of the incident. When he told the
    victim that he had no money, they got into a fight and he stabbed the
    victim in his chest with the knife he carried. (Esfahan General
    Courthouse) International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Qadimi was younger than 18
    when the crime was committed. In his defense, he stated that he did not
    intend to kill the victim but was angry. He also expressed regret. After
    his objection to the court ruling, his case was referred to the Supreme
    Court. (Ebrat News Base) Judgment Branch 17 of the Criminal Court of
    Esfahan condemned Mr. Hamid Reza Qadimi to death. The Supreme Court and
    the Head of Judiciary confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in the presence
    of the victim s family in Esfahan Central Prison on July 2, 2008.
