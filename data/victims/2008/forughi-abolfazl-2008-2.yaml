    Information regarding the death of Mr. Abolfazl Forughi was published on
    the websites of Committee of Human Rights Reporters (December 10, 2008)
    and Human Rights Activists in Iran (October 12, 2007). Mr. Forughi was
    married and had kids. He was once arrested in Tehran by the safety and
    security officers along with a plan called promoting the society s
    security* and was shortly released on bail. Background of Extrajudicial
    Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has
    a long history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the
    world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and
    outside the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing
    a large number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable.
    The actual number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is
    not clear; however, these murders began in February 1979 and have
    continued since then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center has so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran
    attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been
    assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic outside Iran in
    countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan
    in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East; Cyprus, France,
    Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in
    Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases
    there has not been much published and the local authorities have not
    issued arrest warrants. But documentation, evidence, and traces obtained
    through investigations conducted by local police and judicial authorities
    confirm, however, the theory of state committed crimes. In certain cases,
    these investigations have resulted in the expulsion or arrest of Iranian
    diplomats. In limited cases outside Iran, the perpetrators of these
    murders have been arrested and put on trial and the evidence presented,
    revealed the defendants connection to Iran s government institutions, and
    an arrest warrant has been issued for Iran s Minister of Information. The
    manner in which these killings were organized and implemented in Iran and
    abroad, is indicative of a single pattern which, according to Roland
    Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor, contains common parameters and detailed
    planning. It can be ascertained from the similarities between these
    murders in different countries that the Iranian government is the
    principal entity who ordered the implementation of these crimes. Iranian
    authorities have not officially accepted responsibility for these murders
    and have even attributed their commission to internal strife in opposition
    groups. Nevertheless, since the very inception of the Islamic Republic
    regime, the Islamic Republic officials have justified these crimes from an
    ideological and legal standpoint. In the spring of 1979, Sadeq Khalkhali,
    the first Chief Shari a Judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts,
    officially announced the regime s decision to implement extrajudicial
    executions, and justified the decision: These people have been sentenced
    to death; from the Iranian people s perspective, if someone wants to
    assassinate these individuals abroad, in any country, no government has
    any right to bring the perpetrator to trial as a terrorist, because such a
    person is the implementing agent of the sentence issued by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court. Therefore, they are Mahduroddam and their sentence is
    death regardless of where they are. More than 10 years after these
    proclamations, in a speech about the security forces success, Ali
    Fallahian, the regime s Minister of Information stated the following
    regarding the elimination of members of the opposition: We have had
    success in inflicting damage to many of these little groups outside the
    country and on our borders At the same time, various political, judicial,
    and security officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran have, at different
    times and occasions, confirmed the existence of a long term government
    policy for these extrajudicial killings and in some cases their
    implementation.** Mr. Forughi s Death According to available information,
    Police forces shot Mr. Abolfazl Forughi dead in a street in Tehran in
    2008. Officials Reaction After Mr. Forughi s death, security forces
    announced: they have killed him on the run as he ignored the Police
    command to stop. (The Committee of Human Rights Reporters) Family s
    Reaction There is no information available on the reaction of the family
    on Mr. Forughi s death. --------------------- *In early May 2007, a series
    of Police operation called Promoting Social Security Plan was implemented
    throughout the country and in particular in Tehran by the security forces.
    The plan had four stages including fight against improper head covering
    [by women] , collect high risk addicts [from streets] , deal with thugs ,
    and deal with improper head coverings of women in private companies .
