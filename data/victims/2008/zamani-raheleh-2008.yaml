    Because of the physical and mental abuse by her husband, Ms. Zamani went
    to court and filed for divorce. The judge stated: Go make do, my dear
    girl. He s your husband, so he beat you up, [it s not a big deal]. News of
    Ms. Raheleh Zamani s execution was published by numerous sources including
    Isca News Agency (January 2, 2008) and Hamvatan Salam (January 2, 2008),
    Entekhab, Etemad, and Iran newspapers (January 3, 2008). Additional
    information was obtained from other sources* including Ms. Hosseinkhah, a
    women s rights activist who was in the same prison ward with Ms. Zamani.
    Ms. Zamani s prison mate describes her as a tall and beautiful woman who
    was calm, meek [and shy], and polite. Ms. Zamani was 27 years old and was
    from Idly, a village of the town of Sarab, Ardebil Province. She never
    learned Farsi due to her family s poverty and lack of school in her
    village. Until the time of her arrest, she only spoke Azeri. Ms. Zamani
    was forcibly married to one of their neighbors in 1995, when she was only
    14. She said this regarding how she met and married her husband: I was 14.
    We lived in a village in Ardebil [Province]. The boys went to school in
    another village that had a school, but my father didn t allow me to go.
    One day when I came back from working on our farm, my mother told me that
    I had a suitor [who had asked for my hand in marriage] and that my father
    had accepted. They had agreed to have the marriage ceremony the following
    week. I had no idea what a husband even was. They said if you get married
    there will be one less mouth to feed (HRANA). Ms. Zamani moved to Tehran
    with her husband a few years after they were married. According to her,
    she had always wanted to learn hairdressing but her husband never allowed
    her. In prison, however, she learned hairdressing and sewing in addition
    to Farsi. Ms. Zamani had a five-year-old daughter and a three-year-old
    son. Ms. Zamani s case revolved around the murder of her husband,
    Mohammad, in Eslamshahr on April 5, 2005. The issuance and implementation
    of Ms. Zamani s death sentence caused widespread reaction among human
    rights activists, as well as national and international institutions.
    Amnesty International (December 16 and 19, 2007, and January 8, 2008), the
    International Federation for the Defense of Human Rights, Mothers of Peace
    Committee, and the Iranian Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Ms. Shirin Ebadi,
    among others, objected to the sentence and demanded that it be revoked.
    (Radio Farda, January 4, 2008, and the Abdorrahman Boroumand Website). In
    a letter to Ayatollah Shahrudi [then-Head of the Judiciary] a number of
    well-known individuals and university professors in the town of Sarab
    asked that the sentence not be implemented (Deutsche Welle). Reacting to
    the implementation of Ms. Zamani s sentence, Norwegian Deputy Foreign
    Minister, Raymond Jansen, submitted an official objection to the Iranian
    Government, adding: [The fact] that these two small children must grow up
    without a father and a mother is terrifying. We have contacted Iran s
    ambassador [in Norway] and have objected to this savage act. Iran s
    Foreign Ministry spokesman considered the Norwegian Deputy Foreign
    Minister s statements as interfering [in Iran s internal affairs] and
    responded: We are sorry that, instead of being realistic and respectful of
    the laws of other countries, certain Norwegian statesmen try to promote
    and encourage crimes in [other] societies by imposing their personal
    preferences. (Radio Farda January 6, 2008). Arrest and Detention Following
    her husband s brother s report to the police that his brother was missing,
    and subsequent to the discovery of his body in their home (Ms. Zamani s
    home), Ms. Zamani was arrested in April 2005 and underwent questioning at
    Eslamshahr Public Prosecutor s Office. There s no information regarding
    the exact date and manner of her arrest. Ms Zamani spent her three-year
    sentence at Evin Prison. During that time, she asked to see her children
    four times but never did. After her arrest, her husband s sister took
    charge of one of her children and her husband s brother took charge of the
    other one. (Deutsche Welle). Trial On October 17, 2005, Tehran Province
    Criminal Court, Branch 74, tried Ms. Zamani. At trial, she was deprived of
    an attorney; furthermore, she was not able to speak Farsi. She had a
    court-appointed attorney in one trial session, to whom she had never
    spoken before, and who had left her alone to mount her own defense. After
    almost three years (subsequent to the Court of Appeals upholding Ms.
    Zamani s death sentence and sending it to the Sentence Implementation
    [Section]), during which Ms. Zamani s family had provided her absolutely
    no support at all, Mothers of Peace Committee was informed of her
    situation through two members of the campaign (the One Million Signatures
    Campaign) who were incarcerated in the same ward as Ms. Zamani, and
    retained Ms. Arzani as her attorney. Therefore, Ms. Zamani had a lawyer
    (of her choice) only three
