    The execution of Mr. Alireza Barahu i, aka Abdu llah, was reported by
    IRNA, ISNA, and Fars News Services (June 16, 2008), and Radio Baluchi
    Website (May 22, 2008). Additional information on this case was gathered
    from the Amnesty International Report (March 22, 2007). According to
    available information, Mr. Barahu i was affiliated with the Jondallah
    group. Jondallah (Iranian Peoples Resistance Movement) is a paramilitary
    group that was formed in southeastern Iran in July 2003. This group seeks
    to defend the rights of the Baluchi People, who are an ethnic minority in
    the southeast of Iran. Their objectives include safeguarding the culture
    of the Baluchi people, improving social and economic conditions in
    Sistan-Baluchistan Province, and protecting the religious rights of the
    Sunni minority living under the rule of the Shi a government of Iran. In
    order to achieve these aims, this group has taken up arms, and has
    therefore been identified as a terrorist group. This case was related to
    placing explosives and kidnapping in Sistan-Baluchistan Province. On March
    22, 2008, Amnesty International named several Baluchi citizens, including
    Mr. Alireza Barahu i, who were at risk of imminent execution. This
    organization expressed concern about their torture and execution. Arrest
    and detention While he was under arrest, Mr. Barahu i was tortured and
    pressured into a television confession. His and another person s
    confessions were aired by Iranian state television, on March 15, 2007, in
    a program titled The Confessors . The circumstances of Mr. Barahu i s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Barahu i s trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Barahu i by
    the judiciary were Enmity with God and spreading corruption on earth by
    way of membership and affiliation with Abdolmalek Rigi group (Jondallah),
    with the aim of opposing the Islamic Republic. Further charges include
    participating in two instances of placing bombs, causing the death of two
    people, and kidnapping a merchant from Rasouli Square in Zahedan, shooting
    and injuring him . Evidence of guilt The confessions of Mr. Barahu i
    during his interrogation, and his confessions in the television program
    were entered as evidence in his trial. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Barahu i s defense. However, Amnesty International reported that he
    and several other Baluchi prisoners were tortured into confessing on
    television about the bombings and armed assaults. This report aired on
    Iranian state television, and connected Mr. Barahu i and several other
    people to the Jondallah group. According to this report, these prisoners
    had suffered torture resulting in broken arms and legs, hot iron
    brandings, and muscles bored with electric drills (Amnesty International,
    March 22, 2007). Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Alireza Barahu i to
    death by hanging. Mr. Barahu i was executed in the Zahedan Prison on May
    22, 2008 (Radio Baluchi). The state news services reported his execution
    date as June 16, 2008.
