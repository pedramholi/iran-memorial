    (as a temporary marriage) in January of 2004. According to Mr. Karimpur,
    Ms. Hojati looked like his first wife. Ms. Hojati s case was related to
    the kidnapping and murder of Elaheh Karimpur, the six-year-old daughter of
    her temporary husband from his first marriage, from her school yard
    located in Majidieh, Tehran, on February 22, 2004 at noon. Elaheh Karimpur
    sbody was recovered from a pit in the Shiyan Park on February 29, 2004.

    the police station 190 and interrogated regarding the disappearance of
    Elaheh on February 22, 2004; however, she was released after denying to
    have any information about the girl. A week later Ms. Hojati was arrested
    on February 28, 2004. After 24 hours, she was transferred to the Under
    Supervision Section of Tehran Intelligence Police Department 10 for
    further investigation. According to the indictment, the temporary warrant
    for arresting Ms. Hojati was issued on March 10, 2004. Ms. Hojati was
    detained for five years. All or part of her detention was in the Evin

    28, 2004. Mr. Marzban Taheri and a female attorney defended Ms. Hojati.
    After her two attorneys objected to the case, the Supreme Court called for
    reinvestigation and referred the case back to Branch 74 of the Criminal
    Court of Tehran. Branch 74 of the Criminal Court of Tehran, presiding with
    another judge and four counselors, tried Ms. Hojati in three open sessions
    on February 1, 2006, January 3, 2007, and May 23, 2007. Charges The charge
    brought against Ms. Hojati was announced as murder. She was charged with
    the murder of her temporary husband s daughter on February 22, 2004. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Ms. Hojati was her
    confession during interrogations, recovery of the buried alive body of
    Elaheh, in Shiyan Park, testimonies of witnesses during the trial, and the
    forensics report. Eleven days after her arrest, Ms. Hojati confessed to
    murder at the Intelligence Police Office 10 during so called technical
    police interrogations. She stated that because of her intense love for
    Elaheh s father, she did not want to separate from him and considered
    Elaheh as an obstacle. Therefore, she decided to murder her. (E temad
    newspaper on June 30, 2008) During interrogations, Ms. Hojati confessed
    that she dissolved 30 Diazepam pills in juice and put Elaheh to sleep.
    Then, she buried her alive in a pit that she dug before at a quiet spot in
    the Shiyan Forest Park. Some reports indicated that Ms. Hojati only
    confessed to the murder of the girl and did say anything about the burial
    location. Six days after her disappearance, Elaheh s body was recovered
    from the Shiyan Forest Park on February 29, 2004 at 7:35. After performing
    an autopsy, the forensics report declared the cause of death as
    suffocation due to entrance of external objects into the respiratory
    tract. (E temad Melli newspaper on January 29, 2008) The school janitor
    and two mothers of Elaheh s classmates were present during the trial and
    testified as witnesses that they had seen Ms. Hojati leaving the school
    with Elaheh on the day of the incident. The school janitor pointed at Ms.
    Hojati and stated: That day, this woman took Elaheh from the school on the
    pretext of buying a snack. Then, Maryam, the mother of a classmate, stood
    before the court and said: That day I drove my daughter to school when I
    noticed Tayebeh s suspicious movements. The poor girl s step mother was
    hidden behind a car before she took Elaheh s hand and walked away.
