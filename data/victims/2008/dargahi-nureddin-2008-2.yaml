    Nureddin Dargahi was shot and killed while protesting the seizure of
    villagers' farmlands by the IRGC. Information regarding the arbitrary
    execution of Mr. Nureddin Dargahi, son of Haji Hamze Dargahi, from the
    village of Qareh Daghlu in the Parsabad-e Moghan region of Ardabil
    Province, was gathered from reports published by Akhbar-e Rooz (June 5,
    2008), Irane Emrooz (June 12, 2008), and an interview conducted by
    Deutsche Welle (June 13, 2008). Event background The farmlands along the
    Aras River, which had traditionally belonged to several villages,
    including Qareh Daghlu, Ayazkandi, Buyuk Khanlu, and Khalilkandi, had been
    claimed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) for years. Earlier
    attempts by the IRGC to seize control of the lands resulted in violent
    clashes. Even though a Supreme Court ruling confirmed the villagers legal
    ownership, the IRGC refused to comply with the decision. In 2008, the IRGC
    forces moved to take control of the disputed lands once again. According
    to local sources, on June 2, 2008, IRGC forces entered the area without
    warning and set up military tents within the village. The gathering of
    farmers, along with their families, to prevent the seizure of their land
    resulted in direct gunfire from IRGC forces. Villagers stated that the
    shooting was intentional and aimed at the upper body, and that women were
    among those wounded. The disputed lands were valuable, well-irrigated
    fields suitable for rice and wheat farming, and they served as the primary
    source of income for many local families. Mr. Nureddin Dargahi s arbitrary
    execution According to available information, Nureddin Dargahi was shot
    and killed during protests by villagers in Dasht-e Moghan, Ardabil
    Province, over the seizure of their farmland by the IRGC on Monday, June
    2, 2008. (Akhbar-e Rooz, June 5, 2008). That day, IRGC forces entered the
    farmlands along the Aras River without prior notice or legal permission.
    By raising the Islamic Republic's flag on the farmers land, the IRGC aimed
    to take control of the area. When residents from several villages,
    including Qareh Daghlu, Buyuk Khanlu, Khalilkandi, and Ayazkandi, arrived
    at the farmlands with their families to stop the seizure, clashes erupted
    between the villagers and the IRGC forces. According to local witnesses,
    IRGC officials opened fire on the crowd without warning. One of the
    bullets struck Nureddin Dargahi, killing him instantly (Iran Emrooz, June
    12, 2008). In an interview with Deutsche Welle Persian, Mr. Dargahi s
    uncle said: "The shooting was intentional. The gun was not fired into the
    air. The bullet hit Nureddin, killing him instantly. Even after killing
    him, the armed forces stormed the village and searched everywhere to
    ensure that no images of the incident existed." He emphasized that
    tensions between the IRGC and the villagers had lasted for years, and that
    when the IRGC moved to seize the farmers land without warning, the
    residents women, men, young, and old went to the site to defend their
    source of income (Deutsche Welle, June 2, 2008). Regulations on
    Controlling Protests There have been numerous reports of deaths during
    critical demonstrations in Iran. In many of these cases, armed forces have
    used firearms to suppress protests. Iranian law provides certain
    regulations regarding the use of firearms by armed forces during
    demonstrations. In addition, there are legal provisions in Iran for the
    punishment of officials who act unlawfully by firing weapons, as well as
    rules for the compensation of victims. This brief overview will review
    these provisions. The law allows armed forces officials to use firearms in
    certain situations, including to prevent riots and disorders. However, the
    law does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes riots and
    disorders. The Law on the Use of Firearms by the Armed Forces in Essential
    Cases, enacted in 1994, outlines specific conditions for the use of
    firearms. The main principle established by this law is that of necessity,
    meaning that armed forces officers may fire their weapons only in
    emergencies. Regarding protests, Articles 4 and 5 of this law allow
    officials to use their weapons under certain conditions to restore order
    and prevent riots. Article 4 states: "Police officers are authorized to
    use firearms to restore order and control illegal demonstrations, suppress
    riots and disorders that cannot be controlled without the use of weapons,
    upon the order of the commander of the operation, if the following
    conditions are met:". a) Other measures must have been tried first and
    proven ineffective. b) There must be a final warning to the rioters and
    insurgents before the use of firearms. Note 1: The determination of riots
    under Article 4 is the responsibility of the heads of the provincial and
    district security councils. In their absence, it is the responsibility of
    their deputies. If the governor has no political deputy, this
    responsibility is assigned to a member of the Security Council. Note 2: In
