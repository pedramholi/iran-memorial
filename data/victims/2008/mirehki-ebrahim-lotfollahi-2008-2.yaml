    He knew poverty and discrimination too well to be indifferent. He worked
    to pay for his law studies. His hope to be a lawyer and fight injustice
    was shattered in an Intelligence detention center in Sanandaj Information
    about death in custody of Mr. Ebrahim Lotfollahi Mirehki son of Afsaneh
    and Mohammad has been published by Rooz Online (January 28, 2008, January
    16, 2010), Amir Kabir newsletter (January 20, 2008), Human Rights
    Reporters Committee (January 14, 2011), Rooz website (February 19, 2008),
    and Radio Zamaneh (January 19, 2008). Additional information was obtained
    from interviews with the lawyer of Mr. Lotfollahi s family, interviews
    with his family, and interviews with human rights activists. Mr. Ebrahim
    Lotfollahi Mirehki was a senior law student at Payam-e-Noor University in
    Sanandaj. According to one of his closest friends, he was an intelligent
    person with a talent for painting and cartoons. Mr. Lotfollahi was against
    injustice, discrimination, and inequality. Mr. Lotfollahi also paid much
    attention to his religious duties (Rooz Online, January 16, 2010). Mr.
    Lotfollahi was interested in social activism prior to his arrest, he
    volunteered for the Red Crescent Society in Sanandaj for more than two
    years. He also actively participated in Kurdish language classes held by
    Mamousta Sharif Hussein Panahi, a well-known poet in Kurdistan, and after
    finishing the courses he mentored new students. Available information
    regarding Mr. Lotfollahi's political views and activities is
    contradictory. According to Mr. Ammar Goli, a friend of Mr. Lotfollahi
    from high school, Mr. Lotfollahi s family previously supported the the
    Democratic Party in Kurdistan. In accordance with the predominant
    political climate subsequent to the February 22nd, 1999 Kurdish protest,
    the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) achieved popularity through their
    organizing and campaigning work. As a result, many people in Sanandaj,
    including Mr. Lotfollahi, tended to support the party. Mr. Lotfollahi also
    was a member of the Maaf Student Association at his university and was
    involved in student publications (Boroumand Foundation interview with Mr.
    Ammar Goli, January 12, 2015). Mr. Lotfollahi lived with his family in a
    very small home in a slum and he had no choice but to work for his living
    and study expenses. Observing and understanding the deprivations,
    inequalities, and discrimination in his social class gave him the
    motivation and desire to pursue law studies so that in the near future, by
    working as an attorney, he would be able to not only end the poverty that
    he himself and his family faced, but also to solve some of his community s
    problems (Rooz Online, January 16, 2010). Observing and understanding the
    deprivations, inequalities, and discrimination gave him the motivation and
    desire to pursue law studies Pursuant to release of news regarding Mr.
    Ebrahim Lotfollahi s suspicious death in Sanandaj detention center, five
    institutions along with 600 social activists in various areas reacted by
    issuing a statement condemning his death. The International Organization
    for Defense, Human Rights Organization of Kurdistan, Cha k Human Rights
    Organization, the Kurdish Writers' Association, and the Women's Society of
    Azar Mehr in Sanandaj, along with 600 civil, political, press, student,
    and women s rights activists, strongly condemned Mr. Lotfollahi s
    suspicious death, denied the claim of his suicide, and demanded judicial
    investigations and punishment of the individuals involved in his death
    (Rooz Online, January 28, 2008). The protests regarding Mr. Lotfollahi's
    suspicious death were widespread. According to a report by Human Rights
    Activists in Iran, on January 14, 2010, at least 10 people were arrested
    during an event commemorating the second anniversary of Mr. Lotfollahi s
    death which was held at the invitation of Mr. Lotfollahi s family and
    Democratic Union of Kurdish Students. The spokesperson of the Kurdish
    United Front and a group of major members of the Democratic Union of
    Kurdish Students were among the arrestees. Those arrests took place while
    some of the detainees from the first anniversary memorial ceremony were
    still in jail, despite having finished serving their sentences (Rooz
    Online, January 16, 2010). Arrest and detention Mr. Lotfollahi was
    arrested by officers of the Intelligence Ministry of Sanandaj on January
    6, 2008, at the gate of his university. Two days after his arrest,
    following Mr. Lotfollahi's phone call from Central Prison in Sanandaj, his
    family was informed of his condition and was able to visit him (Rooz
    Online, January 16, 2010). He was arrested by officers of the Intelligence
    Ministry of Sanandaj on January 6, 2008, at the gate of his university All
    the family s subsequent attempts to visit Mr. Lotfollahi again were
    rejected by the Central Prison and Intelligence Office in Sanandaj. Both
    institutions subsequently claimed that they did not have him in their
    possession. According to his brother, on the ninth day
