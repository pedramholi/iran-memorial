    2008. Ms. Haqiqatpajuh, 38, a housewife, was raised in a crowded
    eight-member family. Her father was the head chef for the Melli Bank and
    her mother a housewife. (E temad Melli) At the insistence of her parents,
    Ms. Haqiqatpajuh married her first husband, a relative of her mother, when
    she was 17 and had two daughters. When she was 27, she met Mr. Mohammad*,
    her second husband. After she separated from her first husband, she
    married Mr. Mohammad as a temporary marriage. According to her, Mr.
    Mohammad was an addict and encouraged her to use narcotics. The case of
    Ms. Haqiqatpajuh was related to the disappearance and murder of her
    temporary husband in August of 2001. Arrest and detention Ms. Haqiqatpajuh
    was arrested in August of 2001 following the disappearance of her husband,
    Mohammad, and discovery of his body in a river near Tehran. The family of
    her husband reported his absence to the police. After police investigated
    and found the body of Mr. Mohammad, his family filed a complaint against
    Ms. Haqiqatpajuh. Police interrogated and arrested Ms. Haqiqatpajuh at her
    house. Ms. Haqiqatpajuh was detained in Evin and Raja ishahr prisons for
    seven years. She had no access to an attorney during this detention
    period, but she was able to visit her children weekly. In prison, she was
    able to obtain diplomas for computing and doll-making and memorizing five
    sections of the Quran. During her detention period, she suffered from
    abdominal adhesions, severe depression, and tongue tie. She was operated
    on twice. (Cloob) Trial Branch 1601 of the Criminal Court of Tehran tried
    Ms. Haqiqatpajuh in the spring of 2002. There was only one session and Ms.
    Haqiqatpajuh had to defend herself without an attorney. Before the trial,
    a person was interoduced as her public defender; however, according to Ms.
    Haqiqatpajuh, this person did not show up in the court and another public
    defender was assigned who announced that he would submit his defense in 20
    days because of his lack of knowledge about the case. (Hamshahri
    newspaper, October 9, 2004) There was only one trial session and Ms.
    Haqiqatpajuh had to defend herself without an attorney. After the trial
    and until her execution, Mr. Abdolsamad Khorramshahi was Ms. Haqiqatpajuh
    s attorney. Charges The charge brought against Ms. Haqiqatpajuh was
    announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences, against their opponents (including political,
    civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence
    presented against Ms. Haqiqatpajuh was her confession and the discovery of
    her husband s mutilated body in a river in the south of Tehran.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense During the interrogation and trial, Ms. Haqiqatpajuh
    stated that she had murdered Mr. Mohammad to defend the honor of her
    daughter. Her daughter, who was 15 at the time of the murder, testified in
    defense of her mother. (Gooya) In an interview with Meydaan, Ms.
    Haqiqatpajuh described her trial: When I went to the court, I knew nothing
    about the law. I did not know what to say. I could not defend myself. I
    wanted to read my letters but the judge said there is no time. He asked me
    to tell them why I killed him. I had no attorney. I told everything. I
    told the truth. The judge said if there is an attorney, he should be
    present for the trial to become official. The
