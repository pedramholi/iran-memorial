    Mr. Amiri ran his house church in Malek Shahr area in Esfahan. Information
    regarding the death of Mr. Abbas Amiri was published on the websites of
    Aasoo Shahed Alavi (February 01, 2019), The Iranian Bible School and Radio
    Zamaneh (October 29, 2013), Voice of America (June 23, 2012), and Melliun
    (January 07, 2009). Mr. Amiri was married and along with his wife, Ms.
    Sakineh Rahnama , was a Christian convert. After converting to
    Christianity, they used to secretly run a house church in their house in
    Malek Shahr area in Isfahan. Background While Christianity counts among
    the three Abrahamic religions officially recognized in Iran, the status
    carved out for Christians by the Constitution and civil and penal code is
    markedly inferior. In practice, religious tolerance applies only to ethnic
    groups who are historically Christian, i.e. Armenians and Assyrians, and
    not to believers or converts from Muslim backgrounds (UN 1992). The
    Iranian government has implemented policies that demarcate, monitor, and
    aggressively suppress Christian civic presence. The Constitution bars
    Christians from becoming President, members of the Guardian Council, Army
    Commanders, School Principals, and from holding senior government
    positions (UN 1998, IFHR). They are prohibited from running in General
    Parliamentary elections, and the three seats allocated to Christians in
    Parliament are exclusively for Armenian, Assyrian, and Chaldean
    representatives (IFHR). Civil and criminal statutes explicitly
    disadvantage Christian parties. They are entitled to less compensation in
    car-accident settlements and cannot inherit property from Muslims (UN
    1998, IFHR). Several offenses punishable by lashings for Muslims are for
    Christians punishable by death. The activities of Christian churches and
    peoples have long been subject to Ministry of Culture surveillance. A law
    purporting to flag sellers of non-halal foods requires Christian shop
    owners to display signs reading designated for religious minorities; in
    practice, this signage has been enforced on all Christian businesses as a
    deterrent to Muslim patrons (UN 1998). Christians have reported denials of
    academic admissions and business permits on religious grounds (Suuntaus).
    By the mid-90s all but two Protestant churches had closed under various
    government pressures, including demands to provide congregants names and
    personal information (Suuntaus, HRW 1995). Since the revolution, hundreds
    of Christians have been detained arbitrarily. Many are sentenced to
    various prison terms and others are released with the specter of charges
    and investigations against them that are left open indefinitely. Multiple
    sources who have been arrested or detained reported being threatened by
    judicial or security officers with apostasy charges, execution, or
    assassination. With apostasy left unaddressed in penal code, judges defer
    to the Shar ia, leaving Christian converts vulnerable to death sentences
    (ICHRI); it is also left to the personal discretion of judges whether the
    murder of a Christian by a Muslim even constitutes a crime (IFHR). The
    state has historically displayed a lack of due diligence in resolving the
    cases of Christians who die in suspect circumstances, which further
    exacerbates the precarity of Christians social and legal status. While the
    Iranian government does not publicize official data on the size of Iran s
    Christian population, available sources reflect the consensus that
    conversions from Islam have been steadily on the rise since the
    revolution, and that Iranians with Christian leanings could now number as
    high as 1 million, or 1.5 percent of the population (IJRF, Gamaan, MS).
    The regime thus continues to invest significantly in the surveillance of
    Christian activities (IJRF). Scores of Christians have fled Iran and taken
    refuge in other countries (ICHRI, IJRF, ABC Research). The 1990s marked a
    period of religious crackdowns that staggered, among others, Christian
    communities. Amid the overall increase in executions, corporal
    punishments, raids, and press restrictions, scores of Christian converts
    were imprisoned and tortured (HRW 1996, 1993). In an effort to curb
    growing public interest in Christianity, Iran placed caps on church
    attendance, shut down Iran s main Persian-language bible publisher,
    prohibited sermons in Persian, confiscated all Christian books, closed all
    Christian bookstores, and dissolved the Iranian Bible society (Suuntaus,
    UN 1993). The authorities heightened reactivity also brought Christian
    leaders into the crosshairs of the chain murders, a string of
    assassinations during the 1990s of secular intellectual and political
    dissidents and religious minorities (IW) and other undesirable
    individuals. Of the seven suspicious deaths of Christian leaders since the
    revolution, five occurred between 1990 and 1996 (FN). Mr. Abbas Amiri s
    Death " Mr. Amiri died in the hospital on July 30, 2008 , from the
    injuries resulting from the beatings by the security and information
    officers." Accordi
