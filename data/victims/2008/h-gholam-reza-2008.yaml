    News of the execution of Mr. Gholam Reza H. was published on the websites
    of Esfahan General Courthouse on October 29, 2008, Iscanews on October 31,
    2008, and the Kargozaran newspaper on November 1, 2008. He was an Afghan
    citizen and his case was related to the murder of a young Afghan man in
    Najafabad in November of 2006. Mr. Gholam Reza H. was only 17 years old
    when the incident occurred. International laws have strictly prohibited
    capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time
    of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr. Gholam Reza H. was arrested
    after confessing during the interrogation by police following the recovery
    of a body belonging to an Afghan man in a street in Najafabad on November
    20, 2006. The police investigation resulted in his connection with the
    victim. He was detained for two years. (Esfahan General Courthouse) Trial
    Branch 17 of the Criminal Court of Esfahan tried Mr. Gholam Reza H. No
    information is available on his trial. (Esfahan General Courthouse)
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Gholam Reza H. was announced as
    murder. (Esfahan General Courthouse) The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Gholam Reza H. was recovery of the victim s
    body, his confession, testimonies of the victim s friends, and
    reconstruction of the crime scene. (Esfahan General Courthouse)
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense Mr. Gholam Reza H. was younger than 18 when the
    crime was committed. In his defense, he stated that he had been friends
    with the victim for years and he loved him like a brother. But, he spoke
    ill of his sister and insulted his honor. Therefore, he became crazy, made
    a rendezvous with victim in Heidarabad, Esfahan, fought with him, and
    stabbed him with a knife several times. (Iscanews) Judgment Branch 17 of
    the Criminal Court of Esfahan condemned Mr. Gholam Reza H. to death.
    Branch 33 of the Supreme Court and the Head of Judiciary confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged in Esfahan Central Prison on October 29, 2008.
