province: "Khorasan-e Razavi"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Hanging"
circumstances: >
    News of the execution of a man named M. H., along with another person, was
    published in the Khorasan newspaper on February 19, 2008, and, without a
    name, in the E temad newspaper and on the website of ISNA (Iranian
    Students News Agency) on February 17, 2008, quoting the Public Relations
    Office of the Khorasan-e Razavi Courthouse. His case was related to a
    murder. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. M. H. s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch 133 of the Public Court in Mashhad
    tried Mr. M. H. His case was referred to Branch 16 of the Supreme Court
    after he and his attorney objected to the ruling. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges According to the existing reports, the
    charge brought against Mr. M. H. was announced as murder. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. M.
    H. Defense No information is available on Mr. M. H. s defense. Judgment
    Branch 133 of the Public Court in Mashhad condemned Mr. M. H. to death.
    Branch 16 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and his case was sent
    to the Sentence Enforcement Division of the Khorasan-e Razavi Courthouse.
    He was hanged, along with another person, at the Mashhad Central Prison
    yard on February 17, 2008 in the morning.
