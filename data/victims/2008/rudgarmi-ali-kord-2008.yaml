    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Kord Rudgarmi, along with another
    individual, was announced by Islamic Republic daily and Kayhan daily
    (January 10, 2007). His case pertains to a murder in the Seyyed Mahalleh
    neighborhood of Abbasabad County of Tonokabon, in Mazandaran Province in
    2007. Arrest and detention Mr. Rudgarmi was arrested sometime during
    January/February of 2007. He spent two years in prison. However, there is
    no information available on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial
    Mr. Rudgarmi was tried by Branch One of Mazandaran Province s Court of
    Appeals. However, there is no information available on the details of the
    session or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Rudgarmi was charged with
    murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no
    information available on the details of the evidence of guilt entered
    against Mr. Rudgarmi. Defense There is no information available on the
    details of Mr. Rudgarmi s defense. Judgment Branch One of Mazandaran
    Province s Court of Appeals sentenced Mr. Ali Kord Rudgarmi to death. The
    verdict was validated by Branch 27 of the Supreme Court, as well as the
    head of the Judiciary. Mr. Rudgarmi was publicly hanged, along with
    another individual, in the Latak Constabulary of Tonokabon on Thursday,
    January 8, 2007.
