    News of the execution of Mr. Abdolqayum Shahji, along with another
    individual, was announced by the websites of Islamic Republic News Agency
    (IRNA), Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA), and the news website of
    Sistan and Baluchistan s Radio and Television Station (January 2, 2008),
    all citing the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Sistan and
    Baluchistan. It was also included by Radio Baluch in the list of the
    execution of Baluchi prisoners. Mr. Shahji s case pertains to crimes
    connected to narcotics. Arrest and detention There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Shahji s arrest and detention. Trial Mr.
    Shahji was tried in Sistan and Baluchistan Province. However, there is no
    information available on the details of the session or sessions of his
    trial. Charges Mr. Shahji was charged with importing illegal drugs. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt Possessing 3 kilograms
    and 250 grams of heroin was entered as evidence of guilt against Mr.
    Shahji. Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr.
    Shahji s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Abdolqayum Shahji to
    death. The verdict was validated by high-echelon judiciary authorities.
    Mr. Shahji was hanged, along with another individual, in the courtyard of
    Zahedan Prison on January 2, 2008.
