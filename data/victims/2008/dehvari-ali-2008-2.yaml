    On Monday, November 10, 2008, Mr. Ali Dehvari was fatally shot by two
    assailants riding motorcycles with covered faces while he was visiting one
    of the mosques in Saravan. Mr. Dehvari had been actively involved in the
    construction of this mosque. Information regarding the extrajudicial
    execution of Mr. Ali Dehvari, also known as Molavi Sheikh Ali, son of
    Mohammad Nur and Fatemeh, was gathered from interviews with Mr. An'am
    Dehvari, one of his children. These interviews took place on three
    separate occasions: November 17, 2022; October 20, 2023; and January 22,
    2024. Additionally, interviews were conducted with Habibollah Sarbazi, a
    Baluch activist, on December 14, 2023. Data was also collected from
    various sources to complement the information on this case. These include

    Ali Dehvari (December 2005, available at the Boroumand Center archive).
    Sheikh Ali Dehvari was born on March 25, 1960, in Aspich village, five
    kilometers from Saravan in Sistan Baluchestan province. He was born into a
    Baluch Sunni family. Although he spent his childhood and completed his
    elementary education in the same village, he pursued his secondary
    education in Saravan City. Sheikh Ali's passion for religious studies
    emerged early, leading him to dedicate his summer days as a student to
    learning in Saravan's Islamic religious seminaries (Hawza), including the
    "Gosht Einol Oloum Institute." (Interview with An'am Dehvari, November 17,
    2022) In 1981-1982, Dehvari was awarded a scholarship from the "Islamic
    University of Madinah" and traveled to Saudi Arabia to pursue his studies.
    After completing his studies and graduating in 1988-1989, he returned to
    Iran proficient in the Arabic language, earning a bachelor's degree in
    "Hadith Science and Islamic Studies". Mr. Dehvari held the rank of
    "molavi*" in terms of Islamic scholarship. However, due to his rejection
    of the principle of "Taqlid," he did not adhere to any of the four Sunni
    schools of thought. An'am Dehvari, one of Sheikh Ali Dehvari's children,
    explains, "The distinction between my father and other Sunnis of Sistan
    and Baluchestan lay in his divergence from Hanafi ideology and
    jurisprudence. He emphasized that we do not adhere to the principle of
    imitation (Taqlid) in jurisprudence. Sunnis typically follow one of the
    four major schools of thought (Shafi'i, Ghazali, Hanafi, Hanbali),
    considering themselves disciples of one of these four imams. However, my
    father used to assert that we cannot blindly imitate these four schools,
    especially in their errors. Instead, we must seek out the correct
    interpretations." (Interview with An'am Dehvari, November 17, 2022), Iran
    Wire (January 26, 2017). The book "Thoughts of Salafism in Sistan and
    Baluchestan" mentions the "Dar al-Hadith of Imam Bukhari" school, which
    was established by Sheikh Ali Dehvari, as one of the "non-imitator"
    seminaries (Mohammed Bagher Heidari, 2012, page 71). Mr. Dehvari adhered
    to the ideology of "Salafism" and believed in the fundamental principles
    of Islam, advocating for a return to the understanding of the Prophet's
    disciples and direct reference to Islamic reference texts. (Interview with
    An'am Dehvari, October 20, 2023). He vehemently opposed the proliferation
    of "superstitions" in society, particularly practices such as "grave
    worship" and mourning rituals at the graves of the deceased. (ABC
    Interview with Habibollah Sarbazi, on December 14, 2023). Mr. Dehvari
    believed that "the closeness of Shia and Sunnis necessitates acknowledging
    their differences." He expressed, "I do not criticize Shia beliefs,
    although I do not personally accept them. Similarly, I expect Shia
    scholars not to misrepresent Sunni beliefs in Shia pulpits and on
    television." (Interview with An'am Dehvari, November 17, 2022, and October
    20, 2023) Upon his return to Iran, Mr. Dehvari's studies in Saudi Arabia
    immediately drew attention from government forces, leading to heightened
    sensitivity. An'am Dehvari recalls his father's efforts to transport his
    books to Iran through Pakistan in 1989-1990, while he was serving his
    military service in the governorate of Khash city. However, the books were
