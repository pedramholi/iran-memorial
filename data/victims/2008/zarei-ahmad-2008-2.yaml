circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad Zare i was published on the website of
    the Human Rights Activists in Iran on January 9, 2009. He resided in a
    village near Sanandaj. His case was related to the murder of an individual
    in his village in 2002. He was only 16 years old when the incident
    occurred. According to this report, seven other adolescents had been also
    executed in the Sanandaj Central Prison. International laws have strictly
    prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18
    at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil
    and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran
    has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed
    before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr. Zare i was detained
    at the Section Five of the Sanandaj Prison for six years. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial A court in
    Kurdistan tried Mr. Zare i. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Zare i was announced as murder. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Zare i Defense Mr. Zare i was younger than 18 when the crime was
    committed. No information is available on his defense. Judgment Mr. Ahmad
    Zare i was hanged in the Sanandaj Central Prison on December 25, 2008. His
    body was given to his family.
