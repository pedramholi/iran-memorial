    News of the execution of Mr. Babeddin Karbalai', along with another
    individual, was announced by the websites of Islamic Republic News Agency
    (IRNA), Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA), and the news website of
    Sistan and Baluchistan s Radio and Television Station (January 2, 2008),
    all citing the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Sistan and
    Baluchistan. It was also included by Radio Baluch in the list of the
    execution of Baluchi prisoners. Mr. Karbalai' s case pertains to
    trafficking illegal drugs. Arrest and detention There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Karbalai' s arrest and detention. Trial
    Mr. Karbalai' was tried in Sistan and Baluchistan Province. However, there
    is no information available on the details of the session or sessions of
    his trial. Charges Mr. Karbalai' was charged with carrying and storing
    narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    Possessing two kilograms of heroin was entered as evidence of guilt
    against Mr. Karbalai'. Defense There is no information available on the
    details of Mr. Karbalai' s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr.
    Babeddin Karbalai' to death. The verdict was validated by high-echelon
    judiciary authorities. Mr. Karbalai' was hanged, along with another
    individual, in the courtyard of Zahedan Prison on January 2, 2008.
