    News of the execution of Mr. Rahman Shahidi and two other prisoners was
    published on the websites of the General Office of Bushehr Prisons (July
    22, 2008) quoting the Public Relations Office of Bushehr Prisons, Nasir
    Boushehr and Sook. Additional information was taken from the websites of
    Aryanews (October 28, 2007,) IRNA (May 29, 2007,) and Peigham Weekly
    (September 16 and 17, 2006; May 27, 28, and 29, 2007.) Reports were
    additionally published by the Amirkabir newsletter (quoting a November 12,
    2008 Defenders of Human Rights statement) and Amnesty International (July
    29, 2008.) The case of Mr. Shahidi and nine others pertained to the July
    2006 kidnapping and rape of a female student from Shiraz who was studying
    in Bushehr. According to reports, Shahidi and one other defendant were
    younger than 18 at the time of the incident. International laws strictly
    prohibit capital punishment against those under the age of 18 at the time
    of committing a crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran is bound to
    abstain from capital punishment in the cases of such juvenile offenders.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Shahidi and eight others were arrested in July of
    2006 following a complaint filed by a female student in Bushehr claiming
    that she had been kidnapped and raped by seven young men, four of them
    residents of the Chahkutah Village, in a wooded area at the community s
    outskirts. One person escaped arrest. Mr. Shahidi was detained at Borj
    Prison in Bushehr for two years. The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial The Criminal Court of Bushehr tried Mr.
    Shahidi and the other defendants in July of 2006. No information is
    available regarding the trial. Charges According to the Head of the Public
    Relations Office of Bushehr Prisons, the charge brought against Mr.
    Shahidi and five other defendants was announced as rape (Bushehr and
    Sook.) The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that authorities in the Islamic Republic have brought
    trumped-up charges (including drug trafficking, sexual crimes, and other
    criminal offences,) against their opponents (including political, labor,
    and civil society activists as well as ethnic and religious minorities).
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed based on such
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Shahidi was the complaint by the victim and confessions by
    defendants. Shahidi had confessed to committing the crime during his
    trial. International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned
    the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense Mr. Shahidi was younger than 18 at the time of the
    crime s commission. After the rulings were issued, families of the
    defendants gathered in front of the Bushehr Courthouse objecting to the
    legal procedure and demanding that the sentences be halted. According to
    the mother of one defendant, most of those accused (including her son)
    were younger than 18. Regarding the kidnapping charge, she claimed that
    the girl went with the defendants into the woods voluntarily. This mother
    objected to the public defender s role and the rapid pace of the court
    proceedings. The sister of another defendant emphasized that her brother
    was younger than 18 and claimed that the rulings had been handed down
    under outside influence. Protesters claimed that they were losing their
    children because of their inability to defend their rights. According to
    an attorney who was present and familiar with the case, the legal
    procedure for the six defendants was not thorough. Because the attorneys
    did not accept these cases and no skilled attorney was present, the
    defendants lost out on opportunities to defend themselves. Additionally,
    the insufficiency of the information released by the court meant that
    several rumors against the accused spread through the town, prejudicing
    public opinion and making a fair trial impossible. These protesting
    families distributed a text attesting to the consent of the victim s
    family among the judicial authorities, the media, and general public. Due
    to the objection of the defendants to the rulings, their cases were
    referred to the Appeals Court. (Peigham Weekly) Judgment The Criminal
    Court of Bushehr condemned Mr. Rahman Shahidi to death. The Supreme Court
    and Head of the Judiciary confirmed the ruling. Shahidi and two others
    were hanged in Bushehr Prison on Tuesday, July 22, 2008
