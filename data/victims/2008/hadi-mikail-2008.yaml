    News of the execution of Mr. Mika'il Hadi, 60, was obtained through an ABC
    interview with one of his fellow inmates on February 22, 2018. Mr. Hadi
    was a Sunni Kurd. He was married and used to live in Sanandaj. He had four
    or five children, and was from one of the prominent families of Sanandaj.
    He had finished primary school. According to the interviewee, Mr. Hadi was
    a good man, and he owned considerable property and a great number of shops
    in Sanandaj. According to the available information, Mr. Hadi s case
    pertains to illegal drugs. He had a criminal record. Arrest and detention
    The agents of the police force of Sanandaj arrested Mr. Hadi and four
    others, including his son, in the heights of the Salavatabad Village of
    Sanandaj in the fall of 2005 and moved them to the central station of the
    Judiciary Police of Sanandaj. Mr. Hadi, after spending some time in the
    Judiciary Police station, was moved to Ward 5 of Sanandaj Prison. He would
    see his family behind the glass every week, and once a month in person.
    According to the interviewee, during his time in prison Mr. Hadi
    maintained high spirits; he was composed, had no fear of anything, and
    would eat good food and fruit. Mr. Hadi s defense lawyer would meet
    regularly with him and his family. Trial Mr. Hadi and his fellow
    defendants were tried by a branch of the Revolutionary Court of Sanandaj.
    As Mr. Hadi was quite well-off, he was able to avail himself of the
    service of a very able defense lawyer. However, there is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of his trial. Charges
    The court charged Mr. Hadi with carrying and trafficking illegal drugs. He
    was accused of carrying 250 kilograms of opium and hashish. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The discovery of more
    than 200 kilograms of opium and hashish hidden in his truck during his
    arrest was among the pieces of evidence that were entered against Mr.
    Hadi. Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr. Hadi
    s defense. According to the interviewee, in the course of a trial session,
    Mr. Hadi defended his son by stating that it was indeed he who had hidden
    the illegal drugs in the truck, and that his son was innocent. Judgment
    The court in Sanandaj sentenced Mr. Mika'il Hadi to death. The verdict was
    validated by the Supreme Court. Mr. Hadi was hanged in Sanandaj Prison in
    the fall of 2008. After his execution, Mr. Hadi s fellow inmates held a
    funeral for him in Sanandaj Prison. His body was later handed to his
    family. The court also sentenced two other defendants of the case to
    twenty years, another one to ten years, and Mr. Hadi s son to six months
    imprisonment.
