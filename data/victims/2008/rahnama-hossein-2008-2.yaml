    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Rahnama, along with two others, was
    published on the websites of the General Office of Bushehr Prisons,
    quoting the Public Relations Office of the of Bushehr Prisons, Nasir
    Boushehr, and Sook on July 22, 2008. Additional information was taken from
    websites of Aryanews on October 28, 2007, IRNA on May 29, 2007, and the
    Peigham Weekly on September 16 and 17, 2006, May 27, 28, and 29, 2007.
    Additionally, reports were published by Amirkabir newsletter, quoting the
    statement by the Defenders of Human Rights on November 12, 2008, and a
    statement by Amnesty International on July 29, 2008. Mr. Rahnama s case
    and the cases of nine others were related to the kidnapping and group rape
    of a female student from Shiraz who studied in Bushehr in July of 2006.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Rahnama and the other eight defendants were
    arrested in July of 2006 by the security forces following a complaint
    filed by a female student in Bushehr claiming that she was kidnapped to
    the woods nearby Chahkutah village and raped by several young men.Mr.
    Rahnama was detained at Borj Prison in Bushehr for two years. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial The
    Criminal Court of Bushehr tried Mr. Rahnama and the other defendants in
    July of 2006. No information is available on his trial. Charges According
    to the Head of the Public Relations Office of the Judiciary office of
    Bushehr Province, the charge brought against Mr. Rahnama and five other
    defendants was announced as rape. (Sook) The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Rahnama was the complaint by the victim and confessions by defendants. He
    had confessed to committing the crime during his trial. International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    After the rulings were issued, Mr. Rahnama s family and families of the
    other defendants gathered in front of the Bushehr Courthouse objecting to
    the legal procedure and demanding to stop the rulings. According to the
    mother of one defendant, most of them, including her son, were younger
    than 18. Regarding the kidnapping charge, she claimed that the girl had
    left the city with the defendants on her own will. This mother objected to
    the public defender s role and the fast process of issuing the rulings.
    The sister of another defendant emphasized that his brother was younger
    than 18 and claimed that issuing the rulings had been done under outside
    influence. Protestors claimed that they were losing their children because
    of their inability to defend their rights. According to an attorney who
    was present and familiar with the case, the legal procedure for six
    defendants was not thorough. Because the attorneys did not accept these
    cases and there was no skilled attorney, the defendants lost opportunities
    to defend themselves. Additionally, because of insufficient information
    released by the Courthouse, several rumors spread across the town against
    the defendants, resulting in unjust opinion in public preventing them from
    supporting the defendants. These protesting families distributed a text of
    consent by the victim s family among the public, the judicial authorities,
    and the media. Due to the objection of defendants to the rulings, their
    cases were referred to the Appeals Court. (Peigham Weekly) Judgment The
    Criminal Court of Bushehr condemned Mr. Hossein Rahnama and five other
    defendants on this case to death. The Supreme Court and the Head of
    Judiciary confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along with two others, in
    the presence of judges, the Head of the prison, and the Chief of Police in
    Bushehr Prison on Tuesday, July 22, 2008. Three other defendants on this
    case were already executed in the Bushehr Central Prison. According to the
    media reports, the execution of six defendants had been postponed three
    times because of their families requests from the Head of Judiciary and
    expressing their objections to the legal procedure. Because of these
    objections, the Security Council of the province coordinated
