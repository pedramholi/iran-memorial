    News of Mr. Faraz Ebrahimi s execution was published by Fars News Agency
    and Iscanews website on January 30, 2008. Additional information about
    this case was obtained from E temad newspaper (February 18, November 8,
    and December 31, 2007), Iran newspaper (July 2, 2007), Hambastegi
    (September 5, 2007), Aftab-e Yazd (April 19, 2006), Hamshahri newspaper
    (June 14, 2005), Khabar-e Jonub (April 21, 2006), ISNA news agency (August
    17, 2004), Human Rights and Democracy Activists weblog (January 29, 2008),
    Mitra Khalatbari s (journalist) Sokoot Faryad weblog (Maech 13, 2006). Mr.
    Faraz Ebrahimi, child of Mohammad Baqer, was 23 years old, single, and
    resided in Tehran. He met a 14-year-old girl when he was 17, and after a
    while, they made plans to get married. On February 5, 2004, around 9:30
    PM, the girl, who was visiting her grandmother on Farjam Street in eastern
    Tehran, left the house saying that she wanted to leave her dog with her
    friend, and disappeared. Mr. Ebrahimi s case is related to the girl s
    murder in 2004. Arrest and detention Following his girlfriend s
    disappearance, Mr. Ebrahimi was summoned by Tehran Criminal Investigations
    police and was subsequently arrested. On February 6, 2004, a man went to
    the Criminal Investigations Bureau and said that his daughter had left her
    grandmother s home the previous night and had not returned; he said he
    thought Mr. Faraz Ebrahimi, 19 years old, who was his daughter s boyfriend
    had something to do with it because he was not answering his phone. Police
    investigations indicated that Mr. Faraz Ebrahimi had several phone
    contacts with the victim prior to the incident, and he was summoned and
    questioned on that basis. Based on available information, Mr. Ebrahimi
    underwent 28 days of interrogations at the Criminal Investigations Bureau,
    at the end of which period he admitted that he had been in the victim s
    company, but insisted he had nothing to do with her death. He explained
    that he had gone to pick up his girlfriend in his father s Peugeot 405 car
    in order to discuss a minor disagreement, and that he had picked her up in
    front of her grandmother s home, but that she had gotten angry during the
    discussion and had pounded her head against the car window and had started
    to bleed. According to statements ascribed to Mr. Ebrahimi in available
    sources, he then tried to take the victim to the hospital but she passed
    away on the way there. Shocked and frightened by these events, Mr.
    Ebrahimi, had driven toward [the city of] Karaj, and had first dumped the
    victim s lifeless body around the Vardavard gas station, but had then
    returned and put it in the trunk of the car and taken it to his father s
    garden in Karaj. After wrapping the body in carpeting, he had then taken
    it to [the town of] Eshtehard, set it on fire, and dumped it in a well. In
    a poor state of mind, Mr. Ebrahimi asked his father to take the police to
    where he had hidden the body. The victim s body was thus pulled out of the
    well with the assistance of the Karaj fire department. Trial Tehran
    Criminal Court Branch 74 judges tried Mr. Ebrahimi over several sessions.
    In addition to the chief judge and four member judges, the prosecutor s
    representative, the victim s family, and both sides attorneys were present
    at the trial session that took place on March 12, 2006. In explaining the
    motive for the murder, the prosecutor s representative stated that
    according to the Defendant s admission before the investigative judge,
    after knowing the victim for three years and making plans to get married,
    he did not trust her and suspected her of befriending her brother s
    friends. That was why he had killed her. On that basis, the prosecutor s
    representative asked for the harshest punishment for Mr. Faraz Ebrahimi as
    Defendant Number 1, and for Islamic punishment for his father as Defendant
    Number 2. As next of kin, the victim s father then asked for Qesas
    (retribution), the death penalty, for the Defendant. As he was in a poor
    emotional state, he requested that his brother speak on his behalf. The
    victim s uncle then stated that even though Mr. Ebrahimi and his family
    knew what had happened, they pretended they did not, and therefore asked
    that Defendants Numbers 1 and 2 be punished. Stating that the Defendant
    was a very smart person, the next of kin s attorney said that he was able
    to mislead the police for 28 days and pretend to be innocent by destroying
    evidence of the crime. Subsequently a closed door session took place in
    order to look into the charges against Mr. Ebrahimi. The court s last
    session convened on April 18, 2006. Charges The court charged Mr. Ebrahimi
    with intentional murder and commission of crime against a corpse . He was
    accused of having killed his girlfriend by hitting her in the head with a
    stone, and with the help of his father, of wrapping her in carpeting,
    burning her body, and throwing her down a deep well in their garden in
    Eshtehard. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
