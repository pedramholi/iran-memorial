    After a murder-suicide attempt, Mr. Mohsen Gholami thanked the family who
    demanded his execution. News of Mr. Mohsen Gholami s execution along with
    four other people was published by Fars News Agency and Iscanews (January
    30, 2008) and by Tehran Emrooz newspaper (January 31, 2008). Additional
    information about this case was obtained from Ettele at newpaper (May 22,
    2005), Sharq and Qods newspapers (October 23, 2005), Javan (May 21, 2006),
    and Human Rights and Democracy Activists weblog (January 29, 2008). Mr.
    Gholami was 30 years old and a worker at the Iran Khodro car manufacturing
    plant located on the Karaj Special Highway. He had a close friendship with
    one of his co-workers, but that co-worker s parents were opposed to their
    friendship. Mr. Gholami went to his friend s home to find out why he had
    not come to work. The friend s father repaid a one million Tuman debt that
    his son owed to Mr. Gholami and, bothered and upset, asked him to leave
    the premises and end his friendship with his son. Mr. Gholami did not
    accept the money and said that he had gone there simply to find out how
    his friend was doing. At work the next day, Mr. Gholami went to talk to
    his friend and to complain about his parents attitude toward him, but the
    conversation turned into an argument. This case is related to the murder
    of Mr. Gholami s friend in one of the Iran Khodro Company s warehouses
    located on Karaj Special Highway. Arrest and detention On May 21, 2005,
    Mr. Gholami was arrested following the report of a fight at Iran Khodro
    Company to Chitgar Police Precinct 154. Based on available information, at
    9 o clock that morning, Iran Khodro workers discovered the bloodied body
    of one of their co-workers at the plant s warehouse number 46, and then
    discovered and saved Mr. Gholami, who had cut open the main artery in his
    arm and hanged himself in another warehouse. They informed the police and
    took both of the injured to the hospital. The other person died at the
    hospital due to the extent of his injuries. After being questioned by the
    investigating judge on call, Mr. Gholami was turned over to Tehran
    Criminal Investigations Bureau s 10thDivision as the defendant in a murder
    case. Trial On October 22, 2005, a panel of judges at Tehran Province
    Criminal Court Branch 71 tried Mr. Gholami in the presence of the
    prosecutor s representative and the victim s family. Upon presentation of
    the indictment, the prosecutor s representative asked that the appropriate
    sentence be issued, and the victim s family asked for the issuance of a
    sentence of Qesas (retribution). The murder victim s father said that the
    reason for his opposition to his son s friendship with Mr. Gholami was
    that the latter was a wicked and mischievous person. The judge considered
    the seven stab wounds to the victim s chest and legs to be a sign of the
    defendant s hatred toward him. Stating that he did not want to continue to
    live, Mr. Gholami thanked the next of kin for demanding Qesas. Charges Mr.
    Gholami was charged with the intentional murder of his friend. He was
    accused of having killed his best friend with multiple knife stab wounds
    following an argument. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The defendant s statements
    in the investigations stage and at trial; the Medical Examiner s report
    and declaration that the cause of death had been blows with a sharp
    object; confirmation of the defendant s mental health by the Medical
    Examiner; discovery of the murder weapon; and the testimony of witnesses,
    were among the evidence presented against Mr. Gholami at trial.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense Mr. Gholami stated at trial that he had not gotten
    into a physical fight with his friend. He claimed that as he was holding a
    knife, he had told his friend: I want to stab myself with it. His friend
    had replied: Stab me if you can! Under the influence of sedatives, Mr.
    Gholami had stabbed his friend without a motive, and was so upset by his
    actions that he had then tried to commit suicide, but his co-workers had
    intervened. Judgment Upon deliberation with member judges, the presiding
    judge at Tehran Province Criminal Court Branch 71 sentenced Mr. Mohsen
    Gholami to death (Qesas of life, retribution by taking a life ). Supreme
    Court Branch 33 upheld the ruling. Mr. Gholami was transferred from the
    city of Karaj s Rajaishahr prison to Tehran s Evin Prison one day prior to
    the implementation of the sentence. He asked the next of kin for
    forgiveness before the sentence was carried out but they did not heed him.
    Mr. Gholami was hanged in the Evin Prison courtyard on January 30, 2008.
