    News of the execution of Mr. Rahim Pashabadi, son of Hossein, along with

    name, on June 12, 2008, the Human Rights Activists in Iran on June 10,
    2008, Amirkabir Newsletter on June 12, 2008, and E temad Melli on June 13,

    Charges The charges brought against Mr. Pashabadi were announced as rape
    and murder. (Kargozaran) The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Pashabadi. Defense Mr. Pashabadi was ill
    while in prison (Human Rights Activists in Iran). No information is
    available on his defense. Judgment Mr. Rahim Pashabadi was hanged, along
    with another person, in the Sanandaj Prison yard on June 10, 2008. No
    specific information is available about the defendant s execution.
