    The execution of Mr. Abolfazl Rostami and one other person was reported by
    Fars News Service, on January 6, 2008. Additional information on this case
    was gathered from Khorasan Newspaper (July 9, 2007), and from Iran, Javan,
    and Kayhan Newspapers (January 4, 2006). Mr. Rostami was 31 years old,
    participated in martial arts, was married, and lived in Arak. He was a
    former member of the police force. He had resigned his job five months
    prior to the incident, and was a security guard at a company. His case was
    related to murder and rape in the mountains around Arak, in the fall of
    2005. On December 1, 2005, a young girl and boy had gone hiking in the
    Gerdoo mountains in the Arak area. A man identified himself as a police
    officer, and detained them in the Darreh Gol area, for illegal relations .
    The man tied the young boy to a tree and killed him with blows from a
    knife and a rock. He raped the girl, took her identity card, address and
    phone number. He threatened to accuse her of complicity in the murder, if
    she told anyone about the rape. He then released her in town. The girl
    went to the police and reported the crimes. Fifteen days after the
    incident, the man called the girl s house, several times. Arrest and
    detention About a month after this incident, Mr. Rostami was arrested by a
    police officer, on a street in Arak, on December 29, 2005. Police were
    monitoring the rape victim s phone. They asked her to arrange a meeting
    with the man, so they could arrest him. In the course of these events, the
    girl identified Mr. Rostami as the man who had attacked her. Trial Branch
    2 of the Criminal Court of the Central Province tried Mr. Rostami in
    several sessions. The last session of court was held in July, 2007, in two
    parts - public and closed. In the public session, the prosecutor presented
    the indictment and asked for the maximum penalty. The family of the murder
    victim had asked for retaliation for taking a life. In court, the accused
    was sitting in the front row, next to his court appointed counsel and
    several soldiers. He was not wearing handcuffs, and he answered questions
    put to him by the judge. Branch 301 of the Criminal Court of Arak tried
    Mr. Rostami for using a fake police identity card. Charges The Criminal
    court of the Central Province charged Mr. Rostami with murder in the first
    degree and rape . Evidence of guilt The evidence brought against Mr.
    Rostami in court included the testimony of the girl who had been raped and
    who had witnessed the murder. There was also a report concerning the
    murder victim, from the Medical Examiner s Office, showing the cause of
    death to have been injuries to the heart and lungs, caused by a sharp
    cutting object. Defense During the trial, Mr. Rostami denied all the
    charges brought against him. He swore that he had never seen the victims.
    The judge asked him how he had come to call the female victim s house six
    times after the incident. He said, On the first day they arrested me, they
    played a tape of a conversation between a man and a woman, and they asked
    me to say the same things, in the same way. The tape is fake, and I have
    never spoken to this lady on the phone. The judge asked, If you had not
    seen the murder victim, why did you say he was larger than you? Mr.
    Rostami said, According to the deceased s fianc , and under torture, I
    described his body size .all the court sessions and the interrogation
    sessions were unjust. Whatever I said was under duress. He affirmed that
    he had not gone to the Gerdoo mountains, and that he only had a vague
    notion of the geography of the area due to his former job. Mr. Rostami
    said that he had not been fired from the police force, and that he had
    voluntarily resigned and had received a severance package. At the time, he
    had turned in his ID card. In explaining his former statements, he said,
    That day, the police brought in a public defender for me. He said that if
    I write these things down, it would be to my benefit, and I did. Later, I
    found out that he had been a police officer, not my public defender. I
    wrote down my statement under torture that was against the law and
    contrary to religion. I have filed a complaint about this with the Public
    Prosecutor s Office. The judge asked him if he had proof of this torture.
    Mr. Rostami said, When my family and I filed a complaint, they did not
    immediately send me to the Medical Examiner to be checked out. They did
    this after two months. He said his finger had been broken and his head had
    been lacerated. The judge looked at him and instructed the court secretary
    to record that there was no sign of laceration or a broken finger. When
    asked about the victim having identified him, Mr. Rostami said, If I had
    committed murder or rape, I would have killed the only witness to my
    crimes. He said, Maybe this lady had seen me somewhere, or maybe someone
    has described me to her. When asked to explain his confession during
    police interrogation, Mr. Rostami said, I was willing to die a hundred
    times a day,
