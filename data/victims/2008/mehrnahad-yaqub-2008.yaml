    The execution of Mr. Ya qub Mehrnahad was announced on August 4, 2008 on
    the website of Human Rights Activists in Iran and the Iranian Students
    News Agency of Sistan and Baluchestan province. Additional information has
    been drawn from his own weblog (mehrnehad.blogfa.com), Amnesty
    International reports (Feb. 12 and Mar. 12, 2008), the Amirkabir
    University (Tehran Polytechnic) Students Forum News (AUTNEWS Feb. 11, Feb.
    20, Aug. 5, 2008), Radio Balooch website (Sweden, Feb. 9, 2008) and Norooz
    News (Aug. 6, 2008). Mr. Merhnahad, a 28-year old father of three and an
    ethnic Baluch, was a journalist and a civil society activist. He was the
    head of the Voice of Justice Young People s Society, an organization
    founded in 2002 and registered by the National Youth Organization (a state
    agency). The Society s mandate includes education and assistance to the
    disadvantaged. It provides courses and professional training. It also
    focuses on discrimination issues and accountability. The Organization
    holds an annual meeting called Questioning Youth, Accountable Authorities
    in April/May during which social problems are discussed with local
    authorities. Members of the Central Council of the Society are elected
    every year by the Society s members. Mr. Mehrnahad was elected the
    executive director of the Society for three consecutive terms. He was also
    a journalist and editor-in-chief of the Mardomsalary [Democracy] newspaper
    (AUTNEWS, Feb. 11, 2008). Mr. Mehrnahad s stated goal was to eliminate
    what he believed to be the root causes of violence, which characterizes
    his region. He called for social justice, accessible education, and end to
    discrimination. He rejected violence and promoted activism within the
    legal framework. He believed that the only way to provide security is
    through justice, eradication of poverty and discrimination and
    unemployment (his blog, Feb 28, 2007). Therefore, in 2006, he attempted to
    run for the City Council in Zahedan but his candidacy was rejected (his
    blog, Dec. 9, 2006). Mr. Mehrnahad, who attributed the authorities
    rejection to his campaign for human rights and transparency, did not give
    up promoting rights and non-violence: I believe that the right to freedom
    of expression and freedom of thought and defending human rights while
    respecting other people s rights and dignity and while maintaining
    security and public order are my religious and legal duties Some expected
    that by rejecting [my] candidacy, they would attract young people into the
    arena of violent struggle but they ignore the fact that young people are
    too aware and know how to fight for their ideals without violence. We will
    pursue a wide scale struggle against monopoly and tyranny by rejecting
    violence. We are convinced that the future is ours and we will succeed
    acting with wisdom and rejecting violence because if the oppressed use
    violence as do the oppressors, there is no difference between them (his
    blog, Dec. 12, 2006). According to Norooz News, Mr. Mehrnahad was first
    arrested in March/April 2007 for having written an article on his blog,
    criticizing the authorities of Sistan and Baluchestan province and calling
    for their resignation or dismissal. The date of his release from prison is
    not known. At the time of Mehrnahad s second arrest, his 16-year old
    brother, Ebrahim, and three other members of the Voice of Justice Young
    People s Society were also arrested. They were all released after a few
    months of detention. Arrest and detention Mr. Ya qub Mehrnahad was
    arrested at the annual meeting Questioning Youth, Accountable Authorities
    in early May 2007. Some state officials were reportedly present at this
    meeting. There were various irregularities during his detention. Mr.
    Mehrnahad was detained for 5 months in various detention centers of the
    Ministry of Intelligence and had no contact with his family or attorney.
    He was then transferred to Zahedan s central prison where he was held for
    another two months. His first visit with his family probably took place in
    this prison, 5 months after his arrest. He was tried on December 25, 2007.
    Instead of receiving his sentence, expected 10 days after the trial, he
    was returned to the detention center of the Ministry of Intelligence to be
    interrogated again; he was again denied visits. (AUTNEWS, Feb 11, 2008).
    On February 19, 2008, Ya qub Mehrnahad s family was allowed to visit him
    for 10 minutes after 50 days [of not having any visits] (AUTNEWS, Feb. 20,
    2008). During visits, Mr. Mehrnahad stated that he was pressurized to
    confess to the alleged charges. His family noticed that he had been
    tortured; he had lost a lot of weight and was unable to keep his balance
    (AI, Feb. 12, 2008). In one of the visits, they were warned against
    speaking Baluchi; they had to speak in Farsi (AI, Mar. 12, 2008). Trial
    Mr. Mehrnahad was tried on December 25, 2007 at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Zahedan, without the presence of a jury, his attorney, or his
    family (AUTNEWS, Aug. 5, 2008). Amnesty Inter
