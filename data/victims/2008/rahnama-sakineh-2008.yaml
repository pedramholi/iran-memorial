    July 27, 2008 was the very first last time Ms. Rahnama hosted several
    christians in her house church for praying. Information regarding the
    extrajudicial killing of Ms. Sakineh Rahnama was published on Aso Shahed
    Alavi (February, 01, 2019), Persian World and Radio Zamaneh (October 29,
    2013), Voice of America (June 23, 2012), and Melliun (January 07, 2009)
    websites. In some reports her last name is mentioned as Rahimi. Ms.
    Rahnama was married and along with her husband, Mr. Abbas Amiri , were
    Christian converts. After converting to Christianity, they used to
    secretly run a house church in their house in Malek Shahr area in Isfahan.
    Background While Christianity counts among the three Abrahamic religions
    officially recognized in Iran, the status carved out for Christians by the
    Constitution and civil and penal code is markedly inferior. In practice,
    religious tolerance applies only to ethnic groups who are historically
    Christian, i.e. Armenians and Assyrians, and not to believers or converts
    from Muslim backgrounds (UN 1992). The Iranian government has implemented
    policies that demarcate, monitor, and aggressively suppress Christian
    civic presence. The Constitution bars Christians from becoming President,
    members of the Guardian Council, Army Commanders, School Principals, and
    from holding senior government positions (UN 1998, IFHR). They are
    prohibited from running in General Parliamentary elections, and the three
    seats allocated to Christians in Parliament are exclusively for Armenian,
    Assyrian, and Chaldean representatives (IFHR). Civil and criminal statutes
    explicitly disadvantage Christian parties. They are entitled to less
    compensation in car-accident settlements and cannot inherit property from
    Muslims (UN 1998, IFHR). Several offenses punishable by lashings for
    Muslims are for Christians punishable by death. The activities of
    Christian churches and peoples have long been subject to Ministry of
    Culture surveillance. A law purporting to flag sellers of non-halal foods
    requires Christian shop owners to display signs reading designated for
    religious minorities; in practice, this signage has been enforced on all
    Christian businesses as a deterrent to Muslim patrons (UN 1998).
    Christians have reported denials of academic admissions and business
    permits on religious grounds (Suuntaus). By the mid-90s all but two
    Protestant churches had closed under various government pressures,
    including demands to provide congregants names and personal information
    (Suuntaus, HRW 1995). Since the revolution, hundreds of Christians have
    been detained arbitrarily. Many are sentenced to various prison terms and
    others are released with the specter of charges and investigations against
    them that are left open indefinitely. Multiple sources who have been
    arrested or detained reported being threatened by judicial or security
    officers with apostasy charges, execution, or assassination. With apostasy
    left unaddressed in penal code, judges defer to the Shar ia, leaving
    Christian converts vulnerable to death sentences (ICHRI); it is also left
    to the personal discretion of judges whether the murder of a Christian by
    a Muslim even constitutes a crime (IFHR). The state has historically
    displayed a lack of due diligence in resolving the cases of Christians who
    die in suspect circumstances, which further exacerbates the precarity of
    Christians social and legal status. While the Iranian government does not
    publicize official data on the size of Iran s Christian population,
    available sources reflect the consensus that conversions from Islam have
    been steadily on the rise since the revolution, and that Iranians with
    Christian leanings could now number as high as 1 million, or 1.5 percent
    of the population (IJRF, Gamaan, MS). The regime thus continues to invest
    significantly in the surveillance of Christian activities (IJRF). Scores
    of Christians have fled Iran and taken refuge in other countries (ICHRI,
    IJRF, ABC Research). The 1990s marked a period of religious crackdowns
    that staggered, among others, Christian communities. Amid the overall
    increase in executions, corporal punishments, raids, and press
    restrictions, scores of Christian converts were imprisoned and tortured
    (HRW 1996, 1993). In an effort to curb growing public interest in
    Christianity, Iran placed caps on church attendance, shut down Iran s main
    Persian-language bible publisher, prohibited sermons in Persian,
    confiscated all Christian books, closed all Christian bookstores, and
    dissolved the Iranian Bible society (Suuntaus, UN 1993). The authorities
    heightened reactivity also brought Christian leaders into the crosshairs
    of the chain murders, a string of assassinations during the 1990s of
    secular intellectual and political dissidents and religious minorities
    (IW) and other undesirable individuals. Of the seven suspicious deaths of
    Christian leaders since the revolution, five occurred between 1990 and
    1996 (FN). Ms. Rahnama s Death On Sunday August 03, 2008, Ms. Sakineh
