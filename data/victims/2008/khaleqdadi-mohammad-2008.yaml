    News of Mr. Mohammad Khaleqdadi s execution, along with 28 other
    individuals, was published on the websites of Fars News (July 27, 2008),
    ISCANews (July, 27 2008), and Entekhab (July 27, 2008). Additional
    information about this case was provided to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center
    via an electronic form by a person familiar with his case (e-form March
    25, 2021) Mr. Khaleqdadi, son of Rasul, was born in 1973/1974 in Shirtapeh
    village, Sarakhs city, Khorasan Razavi province. He was married and had a
    daughter and worked at a bank. He had studied to become a teacher. He did
    his compulsory military services at Tabas police force. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Khaleqdadi was arrested in Tehran in 2006/2007 and was
    imprisoned for about two years. While in prison, he was not allowed any
    visitation. Trial Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran tried Mr.
    Khaleqdadi. There is no further detail available on his trial session/s.
    Charges Mr. Khaleqdadi was charged with storage and transportation of 4
    kilograms of heroin, sedition, and a prior record of drug trafficking .
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of prescribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There was no evidence
    against Mr. Khaleqdadi (e-form March 25, 2021). Defense Mr. Khaleqdadi did
    not have an attorney and there is no information about his defense.
    Judgment Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran sentenced Mr. Mohammad
    Khaleqdadi to death and the Supreme Court confirmed it. Mr. Khaleqdadi was
    hanged early morning on Sunday July 27, 2008 at Evin prison in Tehran. He
    was buried in Shirtapeh village, Sarakhs city, Khorasan Razavi province.
