    Yesterday [the day before execution] that I saw my brother, he said even

    others involved all escaped. Only my brother remained. Judgment Branch 9
    of the Public and Criminal Court of Esfehan condemned Mr. Javad Shoja i to

    hanged in Esfehan Central Prison. According to his sister, the family of
    the murdered person went to the prison around 4 in the morning to witness
    the implementation of the verdict. We all went there to ask them to pardon
    him. But whatever we did, whatever we said, they were not persuaded. We
    offered blood money, any thing, we begged them. But they said: we just
    want him to be taken to the gallows, then we ll pardon him. We were there
    until 9 when we were told that Javad had been executed.
