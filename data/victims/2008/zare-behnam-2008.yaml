    The information about Mr. Behnam Zare has been gathered from the weblog of
    his attorney, Mohammad Mostafa i (Aug. 26, 2008), the websites of Human
    Rights Activists in Iran, including Mr. Zare s recorded voice (Aug. 26,
    2008), the E temad Melli newspaper (Feb. 5, May 30 2008; Aug. 31 Sep. 1,
    2007), the E temad newspaper (Aug. 27, 2008), Iranian Student News Agency
    (Feb. 5 Aug. 29, 2008), and Amnesty International (Sep. 6, 2007). Mr.
    Behnam Zare was born in Dastjerd village near Estahban (Fars province).
    His father was a farmer who also worked as a shepherd to make a living. At
    the time of his arrest, Mr. Zare had finished the first year of high
    school ( E temad Melli Aug. 31, 2007). On April 21, 2005, a fight broke
    out between Mr. Zare , 15 and an 18 year old individual named, Mehrdad,
    concerning Mr. Zare s doves. Mehrdad had a knife Mr. Zare had an ax.
    Mehrdad was injured during the fight and later died in hospital (Amnesty
    International). Arrest and detention The exact date of the arrest is not
    known. Mr. Zare told the E temad Melli newspaper (May 30, 2008) I was
    afraid and I ran away [from the scene] and went to my father and told him
    what had happened. He took me to the police. Mr. Zare was in Adelabad
    (Shiraz) prison. He knitted there and dreamed of leaving the prison, going
    back to his community, and continuing his education ( E temad Melli Aug.
    31, 2007). Trial There is no information regarding this trial other than
    it took place at Branch 5 of the Criminal Court of Fars Province. Charges
    Mr. Zare was charged with murder. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Zare s defense during the
    trial. In August 2007, he told the E temad Melli newspaper: I had a
    state-assigned lawyer who took my fingerprints and left; I never saw him
    again (Aug. 31, 2007). Eventually, Mohammad Mostafai accepted to be his
    defense attorney. Mr. Zare denied the charged of premeditated murder ( E
    temad ). He regretted his action and said that it happened by accident
    (Human Rights Activists in Iran). He said that prior to the incident,
    Mehrdad had asked him to commit an illicit act ( ibid , Mr. Mostafa i s
    weblog). Mehrdad beat me many times at school. He wanted to hurt [or
    molest] me He followed me and never left me alone. He was three years
    older than me and I couldn t fight him. I only had to run away from him (
    E temad Melli Feb. 5, 2008). Mr. Zare believed if he had not hit Mehrdad
    with the ax, [Mehrdad] would have killed him [with his knife] ( E temad
    Melli Aug. 31, 2007). He said: I was very quiet in our neighborhood.
    Nobody could believe that I committed this act. I still can t believe I
    have killed someone. I hope to see the family [of the victim] and ask them
    to pardon me (Mr. Mostafa i s weblog). A Summary of the Legal Defects in
    Mr. Behnam Zare s Case Based on Mr. Behnam Zare s statements throughout
    the entire proceedings as well as his attorney s defense, he hit the
    victim in the neck with a hatchet during a fight and caused his death. The
    defendant admitted to having hit the victim with a hatchet but stated that
    it was an accident. He stated that he intended to hit the victim s hand
    and that the victim had suddenly tilted his neck such that the hatched
    landed there instead. Further, the defendant was 15 years old at the time.
    Citing Islamic Penal Code Article 206(2), the judges sentenced him to
    Qesas. Pursuant to this Article, in cases where the murderer commits an
    intentional act that is typically lethal, the murder will be considered
    intentional and punishable by Qesas even if he did not intend to kill. It
    can therefore be said that by relying on Article 206(2), the judges
    determined that there was lack of intent to commit murder, and that they
    believed that Behnam Zare did not intend to kill the victim but that his
    act was typically lethal. If we consider the verbiage used in this
    Article, we realize that the law considers the intent to commit the
    typically lethal act as a necessary prerequisite, which is to say the
    murderer must have the intent to carry out the typically lethal act. In
    this case, even though Mr. Zare has used a lethal weapon and the blow
    landed on the victim s neck, the criminal act itself was nonetheless not
    intentional. Here, the criminal act that caused death was the blow to the
    neck, though the defendant insisted that he did not intend to hit the
    victim there. It was necessary for the judges to study the case more
    carefully and determine whether the defendant intentionally hit the victim
    in the neck or whether the blow to the neck was accidental. It seems that
    no specific investigation was conducted in this regard. Judgment Branch 5
    of Criminal Court of Fars Province condemned Mr. Behnam Zare to death on
    November 13, 2005. Branch 33 of the
