    Mr. Mohammad Yussef Sohrabi Nekahchi was a firm believer in God and was a
    follower of the Naghshbandi order News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad
    Yussef Sohrabi Nekahchi, child of Ali Mohammad, along with another
    defendant on this case, Mr. Abdolqodus Mollazehi , was published by
    numerous sources including the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting
    (IRIB) Sistan and Baluchestan Province (April 9, 2008), Tabnak (April 10,
    2008), Asr-e Iran News-Analysis website (April 10, 2008), Sunni News
    (November 4, 2010), Iranian Students News Agency, ISNA (April 9, 2008),
    and the Official Website of the Popular Resistance Movement of Iran
    Jondollah (April 10, 2008). Additional information about this execution
    was obtained from the Boroumand Center s interview with Mr. Habibollah
    Sarbazi, Mr. Sohrabi s co-defendant, and from other sources.* Mr. Sohrabi
    was between 45 and 50 years old, and was known as Molavi (title for a
    Sunni clergyman) Mohammad Yussef Nekahchi. He was a Sunni, ethnic Baluch,
    from the village of Matteh Sang in Sistan and Baluchestan Province. Mr.
    Sohrabi was married and had four children. He had graduated from
    Manba-ol-olum Kuh Van seminary, located in Kuh Van village. He
    subsequently taught Qor an, Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and Hadith
    (reports of the Prophet s tradition) at that same seminary for 10 years
    (The Boroumand Center s research and interview). Mr. Sohrabi was a
    religious man and a follower of the Hanafi** faith, but did not belong to
    any particular group or organization. He was a firm believer in God and a
    follower of the Naghshbandi order. He was interested in Sufism and
    spirituality and did not socialize very much. He would sit in a corner and
    recite prayers for hours. Mr. Sohrabi was a dignified and quiet man and
    was extremely patient (Boroumand Center interview with Habibollah
    Sarbazi). Upon the execution of Mr. Sohrabi and the other defendant in the
    case, the Popular Resistance Movement of Iran (Jondollah) published an
    announcement on its website calling them martyrs . Jondollah denied any
    connection with Mr. Sohrabi and his co-defendant and declared that the
    reason they were executed was that they demanded their rights and had
    risen up against oppression and injustice (Sunni News, November 4, 2010).
    Following Mr. Sohrabi s execution, Jondollah also warned the non-native
    population residing in Sistan and Baluchestan Province to leave the region
    so that they would not become targets attacks by armed groups (Jondollah
    Official Website, April 10, 2008). Arrest and detention Between 2:30 and 3
    o clock in the morning of December 13, 2007, Iranshahr Information
    Administration agents arrested Mr. Sohrabi and 19 other individuals at
    Iranshahr s Dar-al-forqan Chah Jamal seminary without presenting an arrest
    warrant. Security agents, some of whom were wearing military uniforms and
    others in plain clothes, arrested Mr. Sohrabi, who was a guest at the
    Dar-al-forqan seminary, in his pajamas (Boroumand Center interview). After
    arresting him, security agents then forced Mr. Sohrabi down on the floor
    and proceeded to beat and kick him in the side, the head, and the face,
    and insulted him using such words as terrorist (Boroumand Center
    interview). Security agents also searched the Dar-al-forqan seminary where
    Mr. Sohrabi had been arrested, but there is no information as to whether
    any documents were discovered and seized (Boroumand Center interview).
    During his arrest, he was beaten and kicked in the side, the head, and the
    face, and was insulted using such words as terrorist . Security agents
    handcuffed and blindfolded Mr. Sohrabi and took him to the Iranshahr
    Information Administration Detention Center in a pickup truck. After
    beating him in the detention center courtyard, they took him to a solitary
    confinement cell. According to Mr. Sohrabi s co-defendant, Iranshahr
    Information Administration Detention Center s solitary cell was a room
    smaller than 5 by 6.5 , with a very high ceiling and a stone wall, a
    toilet, a shower, and a very small hole where little light would come in,
    and was very cold during winter (Boroumand Center interview). Three days
    after his arrest, on December 16, 2007, Mr. Sohrabi and 8 to 10 of his
    co-defendants were transferred to the Zahedan Information Administration
    Detention Center. According to his co-defendant, they were placed in pairs
    on the floor of the back seats of three or four Peugeot 405 cars with dark
    windows. They were seated in such a way that each person was facing the
    car door and had his back to the other person, one behind the driver s
    seat, the other behind the passenger seat. They were not allowed to talk
    and did not know who they were in the car with. They were taken like that
    to Zahedan, which was a three-hour drive, with just one stop along the
    way. The witness explained: It was excruciating torture; they had
    handcuffed us so hard from behind that blood had concentrated in our
    hands; they had forcibly placed us on the floor of the back seat where
