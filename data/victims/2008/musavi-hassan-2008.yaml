    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan Musavi was published on the websites
    of Esfahan General Courthouse, quoting the Public Relations Office of the
    Esfahan Courthouse, Fars news agency, and Ebrat on April 22, 2008. He was
    from Zarinshahr in Esfahan. His case was related to the murder of a
    21-year-old man in the hills around the city in 2005. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Musavi was arrested by the Intelligence Police shortly after the
    incident in 2005. The victim s family went to the police after their son
    was missing for a long time. Police questioned the witnesses and, after
    recovering the body, arrested Mr. Musavi (Esfahan General Courthouse). He
    was transferred to the prison with a warrant and detained for three years
    (Ebrat website). The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial Branch 17 of the Criminal and Appeals Court of Esfahan tried
    Mr. Musavi. A judge and four advisors were present during the trial (Ebrat
    website). No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Musavi was announced as murder. According to him, the
    murder motive was an illegitimate relationship of the victim (Esfahan
    General Courthouse). However, according to another report, he committed
    the murder because he and the victim loved the same person. (Ebrat
    website) The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Musavi
    was his confession and the complaint by the victim s family (Esfahan
    General Courthouse). The recovery of the murder weapon and the victim s
    body were also considered evidence against him. (Ebrat website)
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense Mr. Musavi defended himself during the trial;
    however, no information is available on his defense. During the
    interrogation, he expressed regret. After the victim was injured, he
    intended to help him but was unsuccessful because he had no means. After
    he and his attorney objected to the court ruling, his case was referred to
    Branch 27 of the Supreme Court. Judgment Branch 17 of the Criminal and
    Appeals Court of Esfahan condemned Mr. Hassan Musavi to death on June 18,
    2006. The Supreme Court and the Head of Judiciary confirmed the ruling. He
    was hanged in Esfahan Central Prison on April 22, 2008.
