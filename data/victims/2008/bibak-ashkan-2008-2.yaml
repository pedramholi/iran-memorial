    Background on Protests to the Election Results of the Eighth Term of the
    Islamic Consultative Assembly The second phase of the elections for the
    eighth term of the Consultative Assembly in the area of Ilam Eyvan Shirvan
    Mehran took place on Friday, April 25, 2008. Early in the morning of
    Saturday, April 26, 2008, preliminary results of the victory of Dariush
    Qanbari came in and his supporters had been celebrating all night long.
    However, a few hours later, news was circulating in the town that the
    final results showed Ali Akbar Matin had won. This news brought out
    hundreds of protestors to the Governor s Office in Western Eyvan. Ali
    Azad, Governor of Ilam at the time, had not released the early election
    results because of long standing disagreements with Mr. Qanbari. This
    added to the tension and to the anger of the people. At about 11 am, armed
    officers who had taken up positions around the governor s building opened
    fire on the crowd who had congregated. As a result, three junior youth
    named Kasra Miri, Ashkan Bibak, and Hamed Asadi were killed. The governor
    of Western Eyvan at the time announced the casualties as three dead and
    more than ten injured. After this event, the Ministry of the Interior
    announced Dariush Qanbari as the victor in this election and the National
    Security Commission of the Assembly removed the governor of Western Eyvan
    at the time. A widespread presence of police and security forces calmed
    the town, but many of the protestors were arrested. Mr. Ashkan Bibak s
    arbitrary execution According to available information, Ashkan Bibak was
    shot and killed around 11:00 a.m. on April 26, 2008, when armed forces
    inside the governorate building opened fire on protesters gathered in
    front of it. (Aftab News, April 27, 2008; IRNA, April 27, 2008; ISNA News,

    numerous reports of deaths during critical demonstrations in Iran. In many
    of these cases, armed forces have used firearms to suppress protests.
    Iranian law provides certain regulations regarding the use of firearms by
    armed forces during demonstrations. In addition, there are legal
    provisions in Iran for the punishment of officials who act unlawfully by
    firing weapons, as well as rules for the compensation of victims. This
    brief overview will review these provisions. The law allows armed forces
    officials to use firearms in certain situations, including to prevent
    riots and disorders. However, the law does not provide a clear definition
    of what constitutes riots and disorders. The Law on the Use of Firearms by
    the Armed Forces in Essential Cases, enacted in 1994, outlines specific
    conditions for the use of firearms. The main principle established by this
    law is that of necessity, meaning that armed forces officers may fire
    their weapons only in emergencies. Regarding protests, Articles 4 and 5 of
    this law allow officials to use their weapons under certain conditions to
    restore order and prevent riots. Article 4 states: "Police officers are
    authorized to use firearms to restore order and control illegal
    demonstrations, suppress riots and disorders that cannot be controlled
    without the use of weapons, upon the order of the commander of the
    operation, if the following conditions are met:". a) Other measures must
    have been tried first and proven ineffective. b) There must be a final
    warning to the rioters and insurgents before the use of firearms. Note 1:
    The determination of riots under Article 4 is the responsibility of the
    heads of the provincial and district security councils. In their absence,
    it is the responsibility of their deputies. If the governor has no
    political deputy, this responsibility is assigned to a member of the
    Security Council. Note 2: In cases where armed forces are assigned the
    task of restoring order and security under this article, they are also
    subject to the provisions of this article regarding the use of firearms.
    This article clearly states that armed personnel must first use non-lethal
    methods and only resort to firearms if those methods fail to control the
    situation. They must also warn the demonstrators. The law does not specify
    what other non-lethal methods should
