    Jondollah *** reacted to the news of Mr. Mollazehi s execution and that of
    the other defendant in the case and called them Shahid ( Martyr ) in an
    announcement it published on its website. Jondollah denied any connection
    with Mr. Mollazehi and his co-defendant and stated that they were executed
    because they had demanded justice and had risen up against injustice and
    oppression . (Sunni News, November 4, 2010). Following Mr. Mollazehi s
    execution, Jondollah also warned non-natives residing in Sistan and
    Baluchestan to leave the Province so they would not be the target of
    attacks by armed groups in the region. (Jondollah s official website,

    with knowledge of the case, the security agents, some of whom were in
    plain clothes and some were wearing military uniforms, climbed up the wall
    and entered the yard, and proceeded to enter the house after breaking the
    door and the windows with the stock of their guns and other means, and
    arrested Mr. Mollazehi in front of his family in his under garments and as
    he was sleeping, without ever producing an arrest warrant. Government

    frightening and traumatizing Mr. Mollazehi s children. (Boroumand Center
