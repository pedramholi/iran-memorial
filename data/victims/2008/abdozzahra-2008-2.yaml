    News of execution of Mr. Abdozzahra(without mentioning his last name) was
    published by Etemad newspaper (February 1, 2008) and Yazd-e Farda website
    (February 7, 2008). Additional information about this case was obtained
    from Iran (October 29, 2007), Tehran-e Emrooz (January 31, 2008), Kayhan
    (November 18, 2007) newspapers, and from Yazd-e Farda website (April 13
    and 14, 2007; October 28 and 31, 2007; December 22, 2007). Mr. Abdozzahra
    was 31 years old and was born in a village in Khuzestan Province. He had
    had a difficult childhood and had a fifth grade education. Mr. Abdozzahra
    resided in the town of Taft in Yazd Province, was married and had two
    children a 10-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son and was a Taft
    government employee. Based on available information, he was a quiet
    individual with a good social reputation. Mr. Abdozzahra s case is related
    to the murder of four boys, ranging in age from 12 to 15, in one of Taft s
    neighborhoods between 2005 and 2007. Arrest and detention Mr. Abdozzahra
    was arrested by Taft Criminal Investigations Police on September 29, 2007,
    after the report of a missing child. An individual had gone to the Taft
    Criminal Investigations Police that day and stated that his 12-year-old
    son had gone missing on his way to school and had not returned home. This
    person s 13-year-old child had disappeared two years earlier while he had
    been playing in the neighborhood, and the police had found no trace of
    him. In the two-year period between these two brothers disappearances, two
    other boys aged 12 and 15 had also disappeared in that same neighborhood.
    Police investigations revealed that the fourth child had last been seen on
    his way home from school, accompanied by his uncle (his mother s sister s
    husband), a man named Mr. Abdozzahra. Taft Criminal Investigations Police
    arrested and questioned Mr. Abdozzahra on that basis. Mr. Abdozzahra was
    interrogated an entire month at Taft Criminal Investigations Bureau during
    which he denied any connection to the matter. He was then turned over to
    Tehran Criminal Investigations Police. Within 24 hours of being
    interrogated at the Tehran Criminal Investigations Bureau, Mr. Abdozzahra
    admitted to having killed all four children, throwing their bodies into a
    well near the town of Taft, and covering them with dirt. After confessing
    at the Tehran Criminal Investigations Bureau, he was returned to Taft
    Criminal Investigations, and with his directions, all four bodies were
    recovered in said well. According to reports, during interrogations, Mr.
    Abdozzahra made conflicting statements regarding his motive for the
    murders. He had said: I killed these children because of their
    inappropriate behavior, (Yazd-e Farda, October 28, 2007), or that he
    thought that these students were the devil and wanted to cleanse the Earth
    of their filthy presence (Etemad, February 1, 2008). The Special
    Investigating Judge of the Yazd General and Revolutionary Prosecutor s
    Office declared, however, that he had stated his motive as being sexual
    abuse of the children and taking revenge on the people around him (Yazd-e
    Farda, October 31, 2007). Based on another report, he had stated that he
    had killed his brother-in-law s child in March 2006, to take revenge for a
    disagreement he had had with him, and that he had subsequently decided to
    commit other crimes in order to satisfy his inner shortcomings and
    complexes . That was why he had chosen several young boys, and though he
    was arrested after the fourth murder, he intended to commit additional
    murders. The Medical Examiner determined, however, that he was mentally
    sound and not affected by any psychological issues (Etemad, February 1,
    2008). According to Taft s General and Revolutionary Prosecutor, when Mr.
    Abdozzahra was arrested, everyone had said that he was a man of good
    morals, and the families of the missing had even gone to the officials in
    charge of the matter and asked that he be released. Trial At 9 AM on
    November 10, 2007, a panel of judges at Yazd Province Criminal Court
    comprised of the presiding judge and four member judges tried Mr.
    Abdozzahra in an extraordinary closed doors session. Based on available
    information, the Prosecutor s representative, the victims families, and
    Mr. Abdozzahra s court-appointed attorney were present at the trial. At
    the end of the session, Mr. Abdozzahra accepted the murder of the four
    children and asked their families for forgiveness. Charges The Court
    charged Mr. Abdozzahra with sexual abuse and intentional murder . He was
    accused of killing four boys, aged 12 to 15, on March 2, 2006, in
    September 2006, in April 4, 2007, and on September 29, 2007, by tying
    their hands behind their backs and strangling them after raping them, and
    then throwing their bodies in well in a garden in the vicinity of the town
    of Taft and covering them with dirt. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. E
