    Mr. Hajati was a calm and smart high school student from a small village
    in Khorasan Razavi Province. News of the execution of Mr. Ebrahim Hajati
    was published on the website of the Imam Ali s Popular Students Society
    (IAPSS) on April 20, 2014 and in the Khorasan newspaper on April 21, 2014,
    along with another person. According to the existing information, Mr.
    Hajati was single and a high school student from the Bardskan Village near
    Kashmar in the Khorasan-e Razavi province. His case is related to a murder
    that took place in 2010 when he was only 16 years old. An ongoing family
    feud triggered by the miserable life of his sister married to a drug
    addict husband and the distribution of a private video of his sister and
    her husband among the residents of the Bardskan village were reported as
    the trigger of a verbal confrontation that ended up in a murder. According
    to the residents of the village including his teacher, Mr. Hajati was a
    calm individual, and a smart and good student in his class. (IAPSS)
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention
    on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Hajati turned himself in to the police custody a few days
    after his brother-in-law s brother was found dead in a garden near his
    village in 2010. The death occurred after a confrontation between Mr.
    Hajati during which Mr. Hajati hit his brother in law's brother on the
    head with a dry wood stick. Mr. Hajati was transferred to Mashhad
    Vakilabad Prison from the Juvenile Rehabilitation Center before he turned
    18 years old. Mr. Hajati was first detained at the Juvenile Rehabilitation
    Center and transferred to Mashhad Vakilabad Prison before he turned 18
    years old. He was detained for four years. His last visitation with his
    family took place at the Vakilabad Prison in Mashhad the day before his
    execution. (IAPSS) Trial No information is available on Mr. Hajati s
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Hajati was announced as
    murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Hajati, but Mr. Hajati surrendered himself to the authorities Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Hajati s defense. A Summary of the Defects
    of Mr. Hajati s Legal Proceedings Based on news published in the national
    media, including Khorasan newspaper, Ebrahim Hajati killed his sister s
    ex-husband s brother in a family brawl in 2010 in a village of [the town
    of] Kashmar, subsequent to the publication of a private video of his
    sister. The killing was reported to have been caused by blunt force to the
    victim s head through the use of a piece of wood. Based on available
    reports, Ebrahim had no prior record of violent [behavior] or criminal
    acts and had killed solely in the heat of the moment. More importantly,
    Ebrahim was only 16 years old at the time of the commission of the crime.
    No information is available about the trial and the sentencing, and
    whether the principles of fair trial were observed. Ultimately, a death
    sentence of Qesas ( retribution ) was implemented in the Vakilabad Prison
    in Mashhad on April 20, 2014 when Mr. Hajati was 20 years old. The most
    important legal issue in this case is Ebrahim s age, and the modification
    of the Islamic Penal Code during the adjudication process or at least
    before implementation of the sentence. Pursuant to the previous Islamic
    Penal Code which was in force at the time of the commission of the crime,
    the punishment for young adults, that is, boys who have reached the age of
    15, was no different than the one for adults. Ebrahim, who had committed
    murder at the age of 16 was certainly tried under this law. The Islamic
    Penal Code was changed, however, on April 21, 2013, and prescribed
    different rules for crimes committed by individuals under the age of 18.
    It is not clear whether Ebrahim partially benefited from a retrial based
    under the current law, which is retroactive in cases of death penalty, or
    whether the final sentence was issued under the old law. It is, however,
    very clear that Ebrahim was put to death one year after the passage and
    coming into force of the current Penal Code. Under the old Islamic Penal
    Code, the punishment for murder for adults [those who have reached
    puberty, i.e., the age of 15 for boys] was Qesas; the new Code, however,
    displaying more flexibility, provides for the possibility of dispensing
    with Qesas for criminals under the age of 18. Although the new Code
    provides that, if the individual under the age of 18 is not aware of the
    nature of the crime, and there is dou
