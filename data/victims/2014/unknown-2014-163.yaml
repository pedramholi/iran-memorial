    News of the execution of an unknown man, along with another person, was
    published in the Khorasan newspaper on February 22, 2014. He was 28 years
    old and his case was related to a fight at a wedding ceremony in a village
    near Kahlilabad, Khorasan, in 2009 during which an individual was murdered
    by a broken bottle. Arrest and detention This unknown man was detained for
    four years. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial According to the Khorasan newspaper, the trial of this unknown man
    proceeded legally. No information is available on his trial. Charges
    According to the report, the charge brought against this unknown man was
    announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against the unknown man. Defense No information is
    available on the unknown man s defense. Judgment The ruling against this
    unknown man was carried out in the presence of forensics and the judges of
    Sentence Enforcement. He was hanged, along with another person, at Mashhad
    Central Prison on February 19, 2014.
