    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Baluch, known as Mola, along with
    four others, was published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists
    News Agency) on August 26, 2014. He was a citizen of Pakistan. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Baluch was transferred from Section One, known as the Align
    Section, to solitary confinement on August 25, 2014. The circumstances of
    his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available
    on Mr. Baluch s trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Baluch were
    announced as transportation and possession of narcotics. (HRANA) The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Baluch. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Baluch s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad Baluch to
    death. He was hanged in the Bandar-e Abbas Prison yard on August 26, 2014.
