    News of the execution of Mr. Abdolreza Fatahi, along with three others,
    was published on the websites of the Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse and
    IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on March 8, 2014, and in the E temad
    newspaper on March 9, 2014. This case was related to the kidnapping and
    rape charges allegedly committed by Mr. Fatahi in 2008. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Fatahi s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial Branch One of the Hormozgan Criminal Court tried Mr. Fatahi.
    No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought
    against Mr. Fatahi were announced as kidnapping and rape. (the website of
    the Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse) The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Fatahi was his confession to several rapes.
    (IRNA) International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned
    the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Fatahi s defense.
    Judgment Branch One of the Hormozgan Criminal Court condemned Mr.
    Abdolreza Fatahi to death. Branch 27 of the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling and it was signed by the Head of Judiciary. He was hanged, along
    with three others, in public at Shahnaz Street in Bandar-e Abbas on March
    8, 2014.
