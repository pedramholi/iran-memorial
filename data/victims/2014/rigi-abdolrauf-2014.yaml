    Discrimination and the government s security policies in Sistan and
    Baluchistan Province had blocked every opportunity for Abdorra uf and his
    friends to engage in civil and political activities inside Iran.
    Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Abdolra uf Rigi,
    son of Azad, was obtained from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center with a person close to him (September 10, 2021). The news
    was also published in the Islamic Republic of Iran media, including IRNA,
    the state-run news agency (IRNA News Agency, August 28, 2014). Additional
    information about Mr. Rigi s case was obtained from the IRNA News Agency
    website (August 28, 2014); Fars News Agency (August 29, 2014); Mizan News
    Agency website (December 5, 2014); Persian Al-Arabiya website (May 20,
    August 28, and 31, 2014); Edalat News weblog (August 28, 2014); Nasr News
    Network (Last updated: October 7, 2015); Fars News Agency (November 2,
    2013); Amnesty International (September 17, 2007); Radio Zamaneh (August
    31, 2014); Islamic Development Organization website (July 4, 2018);
    Bulletin News (September 1, 2014); Persian Al-Arabiya website (August 28,
    and 31, 2014, May 19, 2020); Persian BBC (September 20, 2008); Al-Monitor
    (2017); Minority Rights Group International Report (2018); and Human
    Rights Watch Report (1997). Mr. Abdolra uf Rigi was born in 1980-81 in a
    Sunni Moslem Baluch family in the city of Zahedan. He had a seminary
    education, and in Iran s tradition of Sunni Islam, held the position of a
    Mowlavi , and was a teacher. Mr. Rigi spent his childhood years in various
    towns in Iran s Sistan and Baluchistan Province. (Boroumand Center
    interview, September 10, 2021). In 2001-02, a young member of the family
    by the name of Abdolaziz was shot and killed by the military and the
    Zahedan then-Chief of Criminal Investigations. The family s follow ups of
    the case proved futile, which left a profound impact on them, especially
    on the younger brother, Abdolmalek, leading to the latter engaging in
    armed uprising inside Iran, and later through the Jondollah group.
    (Boroumand Center interview, September 10, 2021). According to a person
    close to Abdolra uf , when Abdolmalek left Iran, several of the family
    members were summoned and threatened by the Information Administration to
    cooperate with the authorities against Abdolmalek Rigi, [and were told
    that] they otherwise would be charged and convicted as criminals. Some
    family members had even been threatened with assassination . (Boroumand
    Center interview, September 10, 2021). According to a person close to him,
    Mr. Abdolra uf Rigi left Iran and took up residence in Pakistan 2004-05,
    due to pressure and threats to cooperate [with Iranian authorities]
    against his brother Abdolmalek Rigi. He had not had any political
    activities against the Islamic Republic until then. According to this same
    source, when he went to Pakistan, however, he worked [with Jondollah] in a
    political capacity, and [did not partake in its] armed activities, and was
    the group s spokesman. (Boroumand Center interview, September 10, 2021).
    After Abdolmalek Rigi s kidnapping and execution in 2010, several of
    Abdolmalek s comrades formed the Jeish-al-Adl group in 2012-13. After a
    while, and following internal discord, Mr. Abdolra uf Rigi and several
    others formed the Jeish-al-Nasr group in 2013-14. Mr. Rigi has been
    described by people close to him as a warm and serious individual. He
    liked sports especially mountain climbing. According to a person close to
    him, Mr. Rigi helped around the house with household chores such as
    cooking . Abdolmalek Rigi s execution affected him mentally for a while,
    but then he returned to normal until the day he was assassinated .
    (Boroumand Center interview, September 10, 2021). The Situation of Iran s
    Baluch Population Baluch ethnics make up one to three percent of the
    country s population and the majority in Sistan and Baluchistan, where
    64-77 percent of residents live below the poverty line. Despite having
    abundant gas, oil, gold, and marine resources, approximately two thirds of
    residents lack access to clean drinking water. Economic policies have
    allowed caused Sistan and Baluchistan Province to remain one of the most
    deprived provinces in terms of education, health, and food. (Boroumand
    Center research). Iran's Baluch minority are mostly Sunni Muslims, whereas
    the majority of Iran s population are Shi'a Muslims. Policies and actions
    from authorities have been restrictive toward the practice of Sunni Islam,
    e.g. limiting and even blocking the construction of Sunni mosques in
    majority-Sh ia areas (including Tehran), arbitrary closure of Sunni prayer
    halls and celebratory gatherings, and violence from security forces
    towards groups of Sunnis praying in public (Minority Rights Group; Human
    Rights Watch: Religious Minorities; Al-Monitor). Baluch activists have
    reported that government repression of Sunni Baluch groups had increased
    since February 1994, when locals gathered at Zahed
