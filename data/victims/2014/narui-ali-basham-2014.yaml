    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Basham Naru i, along with four others,
    was published on the website of the Human Rights and Democracy Activists
    in Iran on August 9, 2014. Arrest and detention Mr. Basham Naru i was
    detained for about 4 years in Section 7 of the Zahedan Central Prison. He
    had been transferred, along with five other prisoners, to solitary
    confinement in the Quarantine Section on August 7, 2014. The circumstances
    of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Basham Naru i s trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Basham Naru i was announced as possession of narcotics. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Basham Naru i. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Basham Naru i s defense. Judgment Mr. Ali Basham Naru i was hanged,
    along with four others, in the Zahedan Central Prison on August 9, 2014.
