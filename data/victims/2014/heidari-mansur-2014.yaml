    News of the execution of Mr. Mansur Heidari, along with four others, was
    published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on
    August 26, 2014. Arrest and detention Mr. Heidari was transferred from
    either Section One, known as the Align Section, or Sections 2, 7, 8, or 11
    to solitary confinement on August 25, 2014. The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Heidari s trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Heidari were
    announced as transportation and possession of narcotics. (HRANA) The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Heidari. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Heidari s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mansur Heidari to
    death. He was hanged in the Bandar-e Abbas Prison yard on August 26, 2014
    in the morning.
