    I will be free only when my thoughts are set free , used to say Mohsen
    Amir Aslani, a young man whose views of Islam did away with superstitions
    and drew crowds . The news of Mr. Mohsen Amir Aslani Zanjani s execution
    was published in several Persian language websites. Information regarding
    his arrest and execution was obtained through research and interviews
    conducted by the Boroumand Foundation, with individuals familiar with his
    case from the Supreme Court, Branch 31, Decision dated August 29, 2011,
    the websites of HRANA (September 23, 2011), Mizan (The Judiciary Branch
    News Agency), Rooz Online and Deutsche Welle (September 24, 2011), Iran
    Wire (October 5, 2011), Jaras (October 15, 2011), and Fars News Agency,
    dated August 23, 2005. Additional information was drawn from interviews by
    Mr. Amir Aslani s family members and students with Persian BBC and Persian
    Deutsche Welle (September 24, 2011), and from VOA program Safheye Akhar (
    The Last Page ) (October 3, 2011) Mr. Mohsen Amir Aslani, son of Ezzat,
    was born in 1977-78 in [the city of] Abadan. He was married and had a
    two-year-old child. He held a bachelor s degree in psychology and owned a
    psychology institute named Soroush Parsian, where he provided consultation
    and conducted classes in Inner Path (spirituality), dream analysis, and
    the Qur an. In the first Inner Path seminar, in 2005, he provided
    explanations regarding his activities: Given the rise in [certain] social
    ills, such as divorce, drug addiction, and depression, there is a need to
    devise methods to solve these problems .In this seminar, we have tried to
    present new methods to get rid of tormenting thoughts and life s bitter
    memories and to defeat depression, as well as to cultivate spirituality,
    strengthen inner forces, awaken the subconscious, and strengthen
    meta-sensory forces. (Fars News Agency, August 23, 2005) "We have tried to
    present new methods to get rid of tormenting thoughts and life s bitter
    memories and to defeat depression, as well as to cultivate spirituality,
    strengthen inner forces, awaken the subconscious, and strengthen
    meta-sensory forces. According to available information, Mr. Amir Aslani
    was Muslim and provided consultations based on religious tenets and
    interpretations. According to a person close to him, he criticized
    traditional beliefs and prevailing superstitions. For instance, in
    interpreting the Jonah Sura [in the Qur an], he believed the Prophet Jonah
    had not [actually] come out of the whale and that this was an allegory.
    Mr. Amir Aslani encouraged his students to read the Qur an but insisted
    that the Qur an should be read in Persian. We read the Koran to understand
    it, not to [simply] perform a pious deed. Mr. Amir Aslani s take on the
    Imam of Time [the Twelfth Imam of Shi a Islam, who is said to have
    disappeared only to return when the world is in utter chaos] was also
    different from the prevailing traditional beliefs. In his classes (and in
    his book, Yassin) he taught that every period has its own Imam of Time,
    [and that is] the one who understands the pains of a particular period s
    society. His understanding of [the concept of] Sherk (Polytheism) also
    differed from that of the state religious authorities, and he considered
    some of the current traditions in Iran to be polytheistic. (Deutsche Welle
    radio, quoting one of Mr. Amir Aslani s students; Boroumand Foundation
    interview) Mr. Amir Aslani s methods were reportedly the cause of his
    popularity among those who consulted with him. According to those close to
    him, the number of his students had gradually increased. In the [Islamic]
    months of Ramadan and Muharram 2005, around 400 people had attended his
    lectures to listen to his interpretation of Islam, a fact that brought the
    attention of the authorities. According to available information, he had
    been told to stop his activities prior to his arrest. Furthermore, certain
    individuals and their spouses, who had joined his group of students only a
    few months prior to his arrest and had lodged complaints against him after
    his arrest and were instrumental in his conviction told his students and
    their parents that his lectures were dangerous and that they should stop
    attending his classes. (Boroumand Foundation interview) Mr. Amir Aslani s
    beliefs are reflected in a number of his books, twelve volumes of which
    were written during more than eight years of incarceration. At his own
    request, some of his books are available to the public on Facebook.
    According to people close to him, in addition to research and writing, he
    played the [traditional Persian musical instrument] Kamancheh and was an
    athlete and a member of Tehran s badminton team. He liked woodworking and
    woodcarving and continued to work out and to work with wood while in
    prison. Arrest and Detention Mr. Amir Aslani was arrested at his home on
    May 2, 2006, along with his wife and a number of his students, by
    plainclothes armed security agents who did not show an arrest warrant.
