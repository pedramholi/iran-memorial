    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan F. was published on the weblog of Ahad
    Ahadi on January 8, 2014, quoting the Head of the Shabestar Courthouse.
    Additional information was taken from the website of the Azarbaijan-e

    Trial No information is available on Mr. Hassan F. s trial. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Hassan F. was announced as "murder." According to the
    weblog of Ahad Ahadi, the defendant, motivated by honor and betrayal,
    murdered the victim by blows of a knife in 2010. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt
    According to the website of the Azarbaijan-e Sharqi Provincial Courthouse,
    the evidence presented against Mr. Hassan F. was his confession.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hassan F.'s
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hassan F. to death. He was
    hanged in the Tabriz Central Prison on January 8, 2014.
