    Mr. Shirani was a speaker for the organization. He would meet with people,
    including tribal leaders, and maintaining contact with dissidents living
    in Pakistan. He was a well-known figure among these groups. Information
    regarding the extrajudicial execution of Mr. Mohammad Davud Shirani Naru
    i, son of Chaker, born in Birjand (Southern Khorasan), married and the
    father of four, was obtained from interviews conducted by the Boroumand
    Center. They interviewed an informed source and also one of his relatives
    over several sessions (September 14, 2021; April 20. 2021; and October 10,
    2023). Background information about Mr. Shirani s case was collected from
    an Amnesty International Report (September 17, 2007), Persian Al Arabiya
    Website (August 28, 2014), and Nasr News Network Weblog (Latest update:
    October 7, 2015). Mr. Shirani was born in 1978 in a Baluchi Sunni family.
    He completed his high school education in humanities in Zahedan, where he
    was born. Mr. Shirani worked in the bazaar, where he bought and sold cars.
    According to a relative, Mr. Shirani had a comfortable life in Sistan and
    Baluchistan State in Iran. He was known because of the activities of the
    Rigi family. In 2001, while he was working at a car dealership, he married
    Mr. Abdolmalek Rigi s sister (Interview with a relative, September 14,
    2021; Interview with an informed source, April 20, 2021). When Mr.
    Abdolmalek Rigi left Iran, Security Authorities became interested in his
    relatives, including Mr. Shirani, and they were repeatedly called into
    security offices for questioning. According to one of his relatives, Mr.
    Shirani was usually contacted by phone and directed to go to the Public
    Information Office on Azadi Street in Zahedan. According to the
    interviewee, every time Jondollah had an altercation with Iranian military
    forces, security forces would increase surveillance on Mr. Rigi s family
    in Iran. In their interrogations, security forces would ask Mr. Shirani to
    bring them news in exchange for his debts . According to an informed
    source, in the beginning, security forces summoned Mr. Shirani just to
    remind him that the family of Mr. Rigi was being watched. Later on,
    although they could have contacted Jundullah on their own, government
    officials would ask Mr. Shirani to convey certain messages to the
    dissidents (Interview with a relative, September 14, 2021; Interview with
    an informed source, October 10, 2023). According to an informed source,
    when he was summoned by the security forces, Mr. Shirani s vehicle was
    impounded several times. Every time, elders would intervene and the
    government would release the vehicle, explaining that there had been a
    mistake . According to the interviewee, after he sold that vehicle, he
    found out from the buyer that security organizations had put a tracking
    and listening device in his car (Interview with an informed source,
    October 10, 2023). Mr. Shirani did not have any particular political
    activity in Iran. In 2007, during the last few times he was summoned by
    the security agents in Iran, they had threatened to build a case against
    him. They had stressed that if he did not cooperate with security
    organizations against Abdolmalek [Rigi] they would make problems for him
    (Interview with a relative, September 14, 2021). Eventually, in the spring
    of 2008, Mohammad Davud emigrated to Pakistan with his family and joined
    Jaish ul-Adl group. According to a relative, he was a speaker for the
    organization. He would meet with people, including tribal leaders, and
    maintain contact with dissidents living in Pakistan. He was a well-known
    figure among these groups. Mr. Shirani was called uncle among his friends.
    He was good at social interactions and he was very effective at uniting
    the dissidents (Interview with a relative, September 14, 2021). Mr.
    Shirani was interested in professional sports. Before going to Pakistan,
    he had a Jeet Kune Do sports club in Zahedan. He had social relations with
    both the Baluch and non-Baluch communities. According to an informed
    source, Mr. Shirani was also interested in genealogy of Baluch families
    and tribes. Many friends and relatives in Iranian Baluchestan would
    consult him about their ancestry and about their familial relationships.
    According to the interviewee, another of Mr. Shirani s personality traits
    was that he helped and protected Iranian Baluchi refugees in Pakistan and
    maintained contact with them (Interview with an informed source, October
    10, 2023). The Baluch in Iran Believed to make up one to three percent of
    the country s population (ABC), Baluchi ethnic groups make up the majority
    of the population in Sistan-Baluchistan, where 64-77 percent of residents
    live below the poverty line. Despite having abundant gas, oil, gold, and
    marine resources, approximately two thirds of residents lack access to
    clean drinking water, and economic policies have allowed it to remain one
    of the poorest-sourced provinces in education, health, and food. Civil
