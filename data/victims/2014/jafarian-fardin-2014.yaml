    An acquaintance explained that at the age of 14, Mr. Ja'farian's
    negligence had led to the death of a friend. There was no malice in his
    act. News of the execution of Mr. Fardin Ja farian was published on the
    websites of Breathing in Confinement on October 18, 2014, HRANA (Human
    Rights Activists News Agency) on October 19, 2014, Iranwire on November
    20, 2014, and Radio Zamaneh on August 5, 2015. According to HRANA, this
    case was related to murdering his friend in 2010 when Mr. Ja farian was
    only 14 years old. He was from Azerbaijan, an athlete with achievements in
    Taekwondo. International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment
    against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the
    crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
    Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid
    capital punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Ja farian was detained for 4 years until he
    reached 18. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Ja farian s trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Ja farian was announced as murder. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Ja
    farian. Defense According to HRANA, quoting a person close to Mr. Ja
    farian, he was a 14-year-old adolescent who had killed his friend out of
    negligence (without malice). No information is available on his defense. A
    Summary of the Legal Defects in the Adjudication of Mr. Fardin Jafarian s
    Case According to certain reports, Fardin Jafarian committed the crime of
    murder at the age of 14. Pursuant to Iran s Islamic Penal Code, the age of
    criminal responsibility is when an individual reaches puberty. Considering
    that by law boys are supposed to reach puberty at the age of 15, if the
    reports of Fardin Jafarian s age at the time of commission of murder are
    accurate, then this young person s execution was completely against the
    law. Furthermore, if Fardin Jafarian s age at the time of commission of
    murder was between 15 and 18, investigations should have been conducted as
    to his mental development. By way of explanation, Fardin Jafarian was
    executed on October 18, 2014, when the new Islamic Penal Code had already
    been passed (April 2013) and was in force. Pursuant to the previous
    Islamic Penal Code which was in force at the time of the commission of the
    crime, the punishment for young adults (that is, boys) who have reached
    the age of 15, was no different than the one for adults. The Islamic Penal
    Code was changed, however, on April 21, 2013, and prescribed different
    rules for crimes committed by individuals under the age of 18. Although
    the new Code provides the same punishment for crimes that are subject to
    Hadd and Qesas for adults as well as for individuals under 18 who have
    attained puberty, if the individual under the age of 18 is not aware of
    the nature of the crime, and there is doubt as to his maturity, the
    punishment will be dropped and changed to incarceration and educational
    actions. Pursuant to Islamic Penal Code Article 91 In crimes requiring
    Hadd or Qesas, if the individuals under the age of 18 who have attained
    puberty cannot comprehend the nature of the crime or the prohibition
    thereof, or if there is doubt as to their mental development [and
    capacity] and maturity, they will be sentenced to the punishments
    prescribed in this chapter on a case by case basis. Note: In order to
    ascertain mental development and maturity, the court may obtain the
    medical examiner s opinion, or utilize any other method it deems
    appropriate. This provision paved the way for exemption from the death
    penalty for criminals under 18. Since most killings committed by
    individuals under the age of 18 are heat of the moment murders, and
    usually at that age, an individual has not reached the level of maturity
    to comprehend the nature of his actions, this provision can practically
    save criminals under 18 from the death penalty. According to an
    established legal principle, in the event that the subsequent law is more
    lenient to an accused or a convicted criminal than the prior law, the s
