    News of the execution of Mr. Edris Hassanzadeh, along with four others,
    was published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency)
    on August 26, 2014. Arrest and detention Mr. Hassanzadeh was transferred
    from either Section One, known as the Align Section, or Sections 2, 7, 8,
    or 11 to solitary confinement on August 25, 2014. The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Hassanzadeh s trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr.
    Hassanzadeh were announced as transportation and possession of narcotics.
    (HRANA) The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Hassanzadeh. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Hassanzadeh s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Edris Hassanzadeh to death. He was hanged in the Bandar-e Abbas Prison
    yard on August 26, 2014 in the morning.
