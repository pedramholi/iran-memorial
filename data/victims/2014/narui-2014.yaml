    News of the execution of Mr. Naru i, born in Zabol, was published on the
    websites of Asredena and Iribnews (News Central Unit) on January 13, 2014.
    Arrest and Detention According to the media reports, quoting the Head of
    the Public Relations Office of the Boyerahmad Va-Kohkiluyeh Courthouse,
    Mr. Naru i was arrested in Sisakht, Dena, three years before his
    execution. There is no specific information on his arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Naru i s trial. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Naru i was announced as "transportation of 60 kilograms
    of crack." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Naru i. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Naru i's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Naru i to death. He was
    hanged at Yasuj Prison in the Kohgiluyeh-va Boyerahmad province on January
    12, 2014.
