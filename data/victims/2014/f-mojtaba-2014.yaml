    News of execution of Mr. Mojtaba F. along with another person was
    announced on the official website of Hamedan Province Judiciary on
    February 4, 2014. Mr. Mojtaba F. s case was related to drug offenses.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Mojtaba F. s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch one of Hamedan Islamic Revolutionary
    Court tried Mr. Mojtaba F. Charges Mr. Mojtaba F. along with his
    co-defendant ( Mr. Alireza M. ) were charged with making and distributing
    199.8 grams of Crystal . The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mojtaba F. s defense. Judgment Branch One of Hamedan
    Islamic Revolutionary Court sentenced Mr. Mojtaba F. to death. The
    sentence was approved by the Chief Public Prosecutor and the head of
    judiciary permitted the implementation. Mr. Mojtaba F. was hanged in the
    Central Prison of Hamedan in the morning of Sunday February 02, 2014.
