circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown young man, along with another person,
    was published in the Khorasan newspaper on April 21, 2014. According to
    the existing information, his case was related to the murder of a
    36-year-old person in Torbat-e Jam in 2008. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of the defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against the defendant was announced as murder. According to the
    report, after having a disagreement, the defendant went to the victim s
    house door and killed him with a knife blow on the neck. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned this unknown defendant to death and the
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in the presence of the
    Sentence Enforcement authorities at the Central Prison yard in Mashhad on
    April 20, 2014. The body was given to his family.
