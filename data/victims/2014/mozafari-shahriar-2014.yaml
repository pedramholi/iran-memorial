    News of the execution of Mr. Shahriar Mozafari, along with five others,
    was published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency)
    on February 19, 2014. His case was related to a murder. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Mozafari s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Mozafari s trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Mozafari was announced as murder. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Mozafari. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mozafari s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Shahriar Mozafari was hanged, along with five others, at the
    Gohardasht Prison yard in Karaj on February 19, 2014.
