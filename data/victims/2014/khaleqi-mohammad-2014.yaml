    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Khaleqi, along with seven others,
    was published on the websites of the Human Rights Activists for Democracy
    in Iran and HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on February 18,
    2014. According to this report, the official media in Iran did not report
    these executions. Arrest and detention According to the websites of the
    Human Rights Activists for Democracy in Iran, Mr. Khaleqi was detained at
    the Hall 3, Unit 2 of the Qezelhesar Prison for 3 years. He was
    transferred to solitary confinement one day before his execution. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Khaleqi s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Khaleqi was announced as drug trafficking. (HRANA) The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Khaleqi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Khaleqi s
    defense. Judgment Mr. Mohammad Khaleqi was hanged, along with seven other
    individuals, at the Qezelhesar Prison yard in Karaj on February 18, 2014.
