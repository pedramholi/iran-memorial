    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Hossein Fuladi, along with three
    others, was published on the websites of the Hormozgan Provincial
    Courthouse and IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on March 8, 2014, and
    in the E temad newspaper on March 9, 2014. This case was related to the
    kidnapping and rape allegedly committed by Mr. Fuladi and another
    defendant on December 24, 2009. Arrest and detention According to the
    website of the Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse, with cooperation of the
    plaintiff with police and judicial authorities, Mr. Fuladi was identified
    and arrested in less than five days in December of 2009. The circumstances
    of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch One of the
    Hormozgan Criminal Court tried Mr. Fuladi. No information is available on
    his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Fuladi were announced
    as kidnapping and rape. According to the website of the Hormozgan
    Provincial Courthouse, quoting the Head of the Hormozgan Courthouse, on
    December 24, 2009, Mr. Fuladi, in collaboration with another person,
    kidnapped a woman on her way back from work in the evening, took her out
    of town, and raped her. He also video-recorded his crime. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Fuladi was his confession to several rapes, and the complaint by the
    plaintiff. (IRNA) International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Fuladi s defense. Judgment Branch One of the Hormozgan Criminal Court
    condemned Mr. Mohammad Hossein Fuladi to death. Branch 11 of the Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling and it was signed by the Head of Judiciary. He
    was hanged, along with three others, in public at Shahnaz Street in
    Bandar-e Abbas on March 8, 2014.
