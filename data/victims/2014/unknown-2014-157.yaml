    News of the execution of an unknown young man, along with another person,
    was published in the Khorasan newspaper on February 16, 2014, and on the
    website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on February 14,
    2014. His case was related to a murder in 2010 when he was not legally an
    adult. (Khorasan newspaper). International laws have strictly prohibited
    capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time
    of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention This defendant was detained for more
    than 3 years. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    charge brought against the defendant was announced as murder. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense This defendant was less than 18 when the murder took
    place. No information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment
    The court condemned the defendant to death and the Supreme Court confirmed
    the ruling. He was hanged, along with another person, in the presence of
    judicial authorities of the Khorasan-e Razavi province at the Vakilabad
    Prison yard in Mashhad on February 13, 2014.
