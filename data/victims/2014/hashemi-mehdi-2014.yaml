    News of the execution of Mr. Mehdi Hashemi, along with four others, was
    published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on
    August 26, 2014 and, along with 12 others, on September 21, 2015. His case
    was related to a murder that took place when he was only 14 years old.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention
    on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Hashemi was detained for 11 years. He was at the Adolescents
    Rehabilitation Center for a while and then transferred to the Bandar-e
    Abbas Prison. He was transferred from either Section One, known as the
    Alien Section, or Sections 2, 7, 8, or 11 to solitary confinement on
    August 25, 2014. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Hashemi s trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Hashemi was announced as murder. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Hashemi. Defense Mr. Hashemi was under 18 when the crime took place. No
    information is available on his defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr.
    Mehdi Hashemi to death. He was hanged in the Bandar-e Abbas Prison yard on
    August 26, 2014 in the morning.
