    News of the execution of Mr. Mohsen Rahmati, along with five others, was
    published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on
    February 19, 2014. His case was related to a murder. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of Mr. Rahmati s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Rahmati s trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Rahmati was announced as murder. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.

    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Rahmati. Defense No information is available on Mr. Rahmati s defense.

    Gohardasht Prison yard in Karaj on February 19, 2014.
