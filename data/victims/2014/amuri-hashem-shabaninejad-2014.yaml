    Information about Mr. Hashem Sha baninejad Amuri (hereinafter referred to
    as Sha bani ) was obtained from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation (ABF) with an eye witness, and member of the Al-Hiwar
    Organizatio,n and from published accounts about Mr. Sha bani, including
    the Justice for Iran organization s report (Conversation with Death,
    February-March 2013), Amnesty International s Bulletin (December 9, 2013),
    Human Rights Watch (January 24, 2013) the United Nations Special
    Rapporteur s Report (January 24, 2013), Mr. Sha bani s letter from inside
    Karun Prison (Padmaz, May 21, 2013), and other news websites. Mr. Hashem
    Sha bani was from Ramshir (Khalafieh), a town located to the south of
    Ahvaz. He was 32 years old, married, and had a daughter. In addition to
    supporting his wife and daughter, he also supported his poverty-stricken
    family, which included his mother, his sister, and his wounded war veteran
    father. Mr. Sha bani taught Arabic language and literature at high schools
    in Ramshir, Khuzestan Province, and was simultaneously studying for a
    Master s degree in political science at Ahvaz Azad University. His poems
    were published in local publications, such as Nur, Fajr, and Asr-e Karun.
    While an [undergraduate] student at Shahid Chamran University, in Ahvaz,
    he was managing director of the Farsi language student publication Nedaye
    Bassirat and editor-in-chief of the Arabic language publication
    Al-Bassirah . At the same time, he was in charge of the political [wing]
    of the reformist students of the Faculty of Literature and Theology at the
    same university. Mr. Sha bani wrote poetry in both Farsi and Arabic. He
    has published two books of poetry in Arabic entitled, Al-E teraf
    bel-Ofoghiah (Reorganizing Ofoghi Thought) and Iqa e Mazarib oddam, (The
    Beat of the Roof Gutters of Blood.) (Mr. Sha bani s letter) Mr. Sha bani
    was also a founder of the Al-Hiwar Scientific and Cultural Organization (
    Hiwar meaning Dialogue ) in Arabic, which was inspired by former President
    Khatami s slogan Dialogue among Civilizations, ) which had obtained
    temporary authorization to operate from the offices of the National
    Organization for Youth* in 2001-2002. Al-Hiwar held cultural programs in
    Arabic, as well as cultural and educational classes for the young people
    of [the town of] Ramshir. It was also active in promoting Arabic language
    and culture, as well as women s rights. The activities of the young
    members of the organization were very well-received by the people of
    Ramshir. As a result, in the second City Council elections in 2002-2003,
    all five candidates supported by Al-Hiwar were elected. (ABF s interview)
    Subsequent to street demonstrations by Iranian Arabs residing in Khuzestan
    [Province] in 2005-2006, the Al-Hiwar Organization was declared illegal.
    Mr. Sha bani and other members, however, continued their activities by
    establishing a library and holding study [groups and] meetings at their
    homes. Continuing these cultural activities led to the members being
    summoned and interrogated by the town s security apparatus. Between 2006
    and 2009, Mr. Sha bani and the other members of Al-Hiwar were summoned and
    interrogated numerous times by the Ministry of Information. (Justice for
    Iran) The security people accused them of promoting ethnic thinking and
    demanded an end to their meetings and study sessions. As written in his
    letter from jail, during the time he was a graduate student of political
    science at Khuzestan s Science and Research University, Mr. Sha bani had
    been active in various internet websites under the pseudonym, Abol-Ala
    Al-Ofoghi, and had been publishing his writings under the title, Al-Ahwaz
    Popular Resistance and Freedom [Movement]. He was a spokesperson for the
    Movement, who also introduced himself under another false name, Abi-Walid
    Al-Ahwazi. A Summary of the Khuzestan Protests Subsequent to the
    publication of a letter dated July 24, 1998, ascribed to then-President
    Khatami s Chief of Staff, Mohammad Ali Abtahi, demonstrations protesting
    the letter broke out on Friday, April 15, 2005, first in [the city of]
    Ahvaz, and then in other cities, such as Mahshahr and Hamidideh, and
    continued for several days. The letter emphasized the modification of
    Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab population through promotion and
    encouragement of the migration of non-native populations to the province,
    [thus] reducing Khuzestan s Arab population to one third of the total
    population of the province. Although the government s spokesperson
    officially denied [the existence of] this letter on Saturday, April 16,
    the demonstrations that had been called for by the Coordination Committee
    for Popular Protests in Ahvaz continued extensively in the coming days. In
    calling for demonstrations, [the organizers]
