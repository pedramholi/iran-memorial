    News of the execution of Mr. Meysam Chanbari, along with five others, was
    published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on
    February 19, 2014. His case was related to a murder that took place when
    he was less than 18 years old. International laws have strictly prohibited
    capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time
    of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Chanbari s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Chanbari s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Chanbari was
    announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Chanbari. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Chanbari s defense. Judgment Mr. Meysam Chanbari was
    hanged, along with five others, at the Gohardasht Prison yard in Karaj on
    February 19, 2014.
