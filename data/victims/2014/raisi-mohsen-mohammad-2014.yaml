circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Mohsen (Mohammad) Ra isi, along with three
    others, was published on the website of the Hormozgan Provincial
    Courthouse, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan
    Courthouse, and IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on March 2, 2014, the
    Campaign in Defense of Civil and Political Prisoners on March 9, 2014,
    along with 11 others, and HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on
    September 21, 2015, along with 12 others. Mr. Ra isi was only 15 when the
    crime took place. (HRANA) International laws have strictly prohibited
    capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time
    of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention According to the Public Relations
    Office of the Hormozgan Courthouse, Mr. Ra isi and several others were
    passing through a secret passage from Qal eh Ganj to Rudan when ambushed
    by official agents. After a clash with agents, two of them were killed and
    the rest were arrested (Hormozgan Courthouse). Mr. Ra isi was detained for
    3 years. (HRANA) The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Rudan tried Mr. Ra isi. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Ra isi was announced as armed transportation of 966 kilograms of
    opium. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences, against their opponents (including political, civil society
    activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities).
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Ra isi. Defense Mr. Ra isi was under 18 when the
    crime took place (HRANA). No information is available on his defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Rudan condemned Mr. Mohsen
    (Mohammad) Ra isi to death. The General Public Prosecutor signed the
    ruling, and he was hanged, along with three others, in Bandar-e Abbas
    Prison on March 2, 2014.
