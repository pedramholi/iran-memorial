    Leila (Arezou) Kargar, a devoted Baha i, chose a park near the site of the
    Bab s destroyed house, for her routine walks and prayers. In one of her
    outings, she called home to say that she was late because a wellspoken
    lady was discussing religion with her and giving her fruit juice. She
    never drank fruit juices. Information about the extrajudicial killing of
    Ms. Leila (Arezou) Kargar Haji Abadi, daughter of Shir Hossein, was
    obtained from the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran
    (ABC) interview with one of Ms Kargar s relatives on April 9, 2024.
    Additional information was drawn from a speech of the commander of Fars
    Province Fajr Army , a local Revolutionary Guards security/military unit,
    published in Tanvir , the web outlet of Sepah Fajr of Fars Province, (July
    25, 2014;) Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) (May 31, 2014) republished
    by the Iran Bahai Persecution website; Iranwire article, "The Ambiguous
    Story of the Death of a Bah ' Citizen in Shiraz" (January 10, 2015), HRANA
    s report "Bahai Woman Died because of Lethal Poisoning in Shiraz" (January
    6, 2015), Richard N. Ostling s Time Magazine article (February 20, 1984),
    and Douglas Martin s Baha i Studies work (vol. 12/13, 1984). Additional
    references include reports from the Iranian Students News Agency (June 29,
    2010), Shia News Agency (January 20, 2009), and the Asoo website (October
    6, 2015). Ms. Kargar was born on March 15, 1972, although her birth was
    officially registered as August 23, 1971, to enable early school
    enrollment. She was the youngest of five siblings three brothers and one
    sister. Her Bah ' mother married a Muslim man who later converted to the
    Bah ' faith. He served as chief of the gendarmerie under the Shah s regime
    and retired shortly before the Iran-Iraq War. Leila converted to the Bah '
    faith around the age of nine, a decision that later barred her from
    attending university. She completed her education at a Bah ' school and
    worked as a private tutor in Arabic and English language. Alongside her
    older sister, she also taught music flute and bells at Nakisa Music
    School. However, after disclosing their Bah ' faith on a personal
    information form, both were dismissed and banned from the school.
    According to the director, the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance
    had threatened to smash the school s windows if they remained on the
    premises. (ABC interview with Ms. Kargar s relative, April 9, 2024) The
    Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the
    Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious
    community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300
    thousand members in 1979("Slow Death for Iran s Baha is", February 20,
    1984)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their
    most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under
    the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to
    it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.* Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the time
    of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified and
    institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah
    Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain instances,
    even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to Iran, in
    response to a question regarding political and religious freedom of Baha
    is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated:
    They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They will
    not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they be
    free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history
    of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the
    1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the
    country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since
    then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has
    so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in
