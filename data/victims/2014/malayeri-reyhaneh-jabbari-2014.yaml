    Reyhaneh Jabbari was 19, independent, ambitious, and daring. She could
    have become a famous decorator. Reyhaneh Jabbari Malayeri's execution was
    announced by various sources, including the public relations department of
    Tehran's Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor's Office (25 October 2014),
    Fars News (25 October 2014), her lawyer, Mr. Khoramshahi, and her mother
    in interviews ( BBC , 25 October 2014). Additional information and details
    related to the case have been taken from Ms. Jabbari's diaries (The Save
    Reyhaneh Jabbari facebook page), Ms. Jabbari's [first] lawyer's notes (Mr.
    Mostafa'i's blog and Facebook), Boroumand Foundation's interview with Ms.,
    Jabbari s mother, an interview with Mr. Tardast, the judge presiding over
    the case ( Ghanoon Media News Agency (23 April 2014), and various other
    media and other sources, including Etemad (23 November 2009), ISNA (23
    June 2014), Mehr News Agency (26 April 2014) and Fars News Agency (28
    October 2014). Ms. Jabbari was born in Tehran in 1988. She was the eldest
    child of a five-member family. She was in her third year of studying
    computer software, while working part-time in a firm of interior
    decorators. According to her relatives, Ms. Jabbari was artistically
    talented, especially in the sphere of painting and interior decorating.
    Another one of her talents was writing. In the spring of 2007, when she
    was 19 years old, she met Mr. Morteza Abolali Sarbandi, a 47-year-old
    doctor and former Intelligence Ministry employee, at an ice cream parlor.
    This acquaintance culminated in the stabbing of Dr. Sarbandi with a knife
    during an altercation between the two at his private apartment on Mirdamad
    Avenue (Tehran), on 7 July 2007. Based on available reports, Mr. Sarbandi
    died as a result of a severe hemorrhage. According to Ms. Jabbari, she had
    visited the apartment on that day, under the impression that it was a
    workplace. She went there for the purpose of designing the interior
    decoration of a surgery. She realized, however, that Mr Sarbandi intended
    to rape her; hence wounded him by stabbing him in the shoulder with a
    knife. She fled the scene after calling for an ambulance (Ms. Jabbari's
    diaries Part Two). International Protests over Ms. Jabbari's Execution A
    few years after the announcement of the final verdict in the case of Ms.
    Jabbari, the case was highlighted in the media, attracting the attention
    of numerous international human rights forums and organizations. Amnesty
    International and the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran, Dr.
    Ahmed Shaheed, cited violation of due process, described her trial process
    as "unjust", and made strenuous efforts to halt her execution. In the wake
    of Ms. Jabbari's execution, Amnesty International issued a statement,
    condemning the execution, describing it as another bloody stain on Iran's
    human rights record. (Amnesty International in English and BBC Persian 25
    October 2014) US and German authorities also expressed regret at Ms.
    Jabbari's execution and voiced concern regarding the fairness of her
    trial. ( Deutsche Welle, 25 October 2014) Arrest and detention Ms. Jabbari
    was arrested (after she was tracked via her cell phone), by Branch 10 of
    the City of Tehran's Investigation Bureau, in the early hours of 8 July
    2007. She was first taken to Abbasabad [Avenue] Police Station, Branch
    104, and the following morning to Branch 10 of the Shapur Avenue
    Investigation Bureau. Upon searching Ms. Jabbari's home, officers found a
    knife, a bloodied manteau, and a headscarf. (Investigating magistrate, Mr.
    Shamlu, Mehr news agency, 26 April 2014) According to her lawyer and
    mother, Ms. Jabbari was in solitary confinement for about two months (at
    the Shapur Avenue Investigation Bureau, for the first 10 days, and Evin's
    Ward 209, for the rest), without being allowed to see a lawyer or family
    members. From around October 2007 to 2011, when she was transferred to
    Shahr-e Rey Prison, Ms. Jabbari was kept in various wards in Evin Prison.
    In December 2007, Ms. Jabbari was taken to the Shapur Avenue Investigation
    Bureau, for 10 days, before being transferred back to Evin Prison. During
    that period, she was subjected to various kinds of psychological torture
    (humiliation, insult, obscene language, and threats; her family members
    were arrested ...), as well as physical torture (flogging, slapping,
    kicking ...). (Diaries of Reyhaneh Jabbari, Parts 1,2,3,4,7, and CNN in
    English, 25 October 2014). In one of her letters from prison, she
    described the conduct of one of her interrogators: "The chubby man pulled
    my head back, and the beardless man slapped my ears a few times: left,
    right, left, right. I experienced the first real thrashing of my life. ...
    I felt something in my back. I felt the swelling of my skin, and then ...
    rip.... my skin ruptured. I had a vision of my little sisters being made
    helpless like me. ... They bound your hands and feet. Then they hung you
