    News of the execution of Mr. Abdollah Pabandan, along with three others,
    was published on the website of the Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse,
    quoting the Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan Courthouse, and IRNA
    (Islamic Republic News Agency) on March 2, 2014, and the Campaign in
    Defense of Civil and Political Prisoners on March 9, 2014, along with 11
    others. Arrest and detention According to the Public Relations Office of
    the Hormozgan Courthouse, Mr. Pabandan and several others were passing
    through a secret passage from Qal eh Ganj to Rudan when ambushed by
    official agents. After a clash with agents, two of them were killed and
    the rest were arrested (Hormozgan Courthouse). The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Rudan tried Mr. Pabandan. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Pabandan was announced as armed
    transportation of 966 kilograms of opium. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Pabandan.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Pabandan s defense. Judgment
    The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Rudan condemned Mr. Abdollah Pabandan
    to death. The General Public Prosecutor signed the ruling, and he was
    hanged, along with three others, in Bandar-e Abbas Prison on March 2,
    2014.
