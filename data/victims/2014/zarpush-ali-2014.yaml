    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Zarpush, along with seven others, was
    published on the websites of the Human Rights Activists for Democracy in
    Iran and HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on February 18, 2014.
    According to this report, the official media in Iran did not report these
    executions. Arrest and detention According to the websites of the Human
    Rights Activists for Democracy in Iran, Mr. Zarpush was detained at the
    Hall 3, Unit 2 of the Qezelhesar Prison. He was transferred to solitary
    confinement one day before his execution. The circumstances of his arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Zarpush s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Zarpush was
    announced as drug trafficking. (HRANA) The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Zarpush. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Zarpush s defense. Judgment Mr. Ali
    Zarpush was hanged, along with seven other individuals, at the Qezelhesar
    Prison yard in Karaj on February 18, 2014. According to HRANA, his body
    was transferred to Kermanshah.
