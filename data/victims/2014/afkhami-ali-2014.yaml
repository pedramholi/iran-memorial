    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Afkhami, along with seven others, was
    published on the websites of the Human Rights Activists for Democracy in
    Iran and HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on February 18, 2014.
    According to this report, the official media in Iran did not report these
    executions. Arrest and detention According to the websites of the Human
    Rights Activists for Democracy in Iran, Mr. Afkhami was arrested when he
    was aged 20 and transferred to the Hall 3, Unit 2 of the Qezelhesar
    Prison. He was transferred to solitary confinement one day before his
    execution. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Afkhami s trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Afkhami was announced as drug trafficking.
    (HRANA) The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Afkhami. Defense No information is available on Mr. Afkhami s
    defense. Judgment Mr. Ali Afkhami was hanged, along with seven other
    individuals, at the Qezelhesar Prison yard in Karaj on February 18, 2014.
