    News of the execution of Mr. Amir Sardeha i, quoting an attorney, was
    published on the website of Gunaz.tv on June 10, 2014 and, along with
    another person, on the website of Oyannews on June 13, 2014. According to
    the existing information, his case was related to a murder in 2007 when
    Mr. Sardeha i was 17 years old. (Gunaz.tv) International laws have
    strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the
    age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the
    Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence
    committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr. Sardeha i
    was detained for seven and a half years in Tabriz Prison (Oyannews). The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 12
    of the Criminal Court of Azarbaijan-e Sharqi tried Mr. Sardeha i. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Sardeha i was announced as murder. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Sardeha i. Defense Mr. Sardeha i was less than 18 years old at the time of
    the committed crime. No information is available on his defense. Judgment
    Branch 12 of the Criminal Court of Azarbaijan-e Sharqi condemned Mr. Amir
    Sardeha i to death. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling in 2010. He was
    hanged at the Tabriz Prison yard on June 9, 2014.
