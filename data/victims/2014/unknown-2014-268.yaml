    News of the execution of an unknown woman, along with four others, was
    published on the website of the Human Rights and Democracy Activists in
    Iran on August 9, 2014. She was executed along with her son, Mr. Osman
    Dahmardeh. Her name is not mentioned in any report. Arrest and detention
    This unknown woman was arrested along with her son. She was detained in
    the Women s Section of the Zahedan Central Prison. The circumstances of
    her arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant s trial. Charges The charge brought against the defendant
    and four others was announced as possession of narcotics. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against this unknown
    woman. Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense.
    Judgment This unknown woman was hanged, along with four others, in the
    Zahedan Central Prison on August 9, 2014.
