    (Edalatnews and Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran) The Popular

    This group declared its goal as the struggle for achieving the religious
    and national rights of Baluch and Sunni people in Sistan Va Baluchestan
    province in Iran and emphasized that it is not a separatist group. In
    2005, this group began a series of military operations against Islamic
    Republic forces during which dozens of the regime s forces were captured
    or killed. In response, the Islamic Republic arrested and executed dozens
    of members of this group; military operations continue in Sistan Va
    Baluchestan. In an interview with the media outside of Iran, the leader of
    this group, Abdolmalek Rigi, rejected the government s labels of terrorist
    and foreign agent and claimed that they began their struggle against the
    Islamic Republic to replace it with a popular regime that recognizes the
    rights of all humans. The news of this arrest was published by the
    Intelligence Ministry of Iran on February 23, 2010, and the circumstance
    of his arrest is yet unknown. Abdolmalek Rigi was hanged in the Evin
    prison on June 20, 2010. Arrest and Detention Mr. Shahbakhsh was arrested
    on May 21, 2012 in Cheshmeh Ziarat, 30 kilometers from Zahedan, while,

    mortars before arresting him. Mr. Shahbakhsh was transferred to a local

    Ministry Detention Center. He was in solitary confinement for 10 months
    and in quarantine in Zahedan Prison for eight months and was not allowed
    to visit his family. According to the published testimony of Mr.
    Shahbakhsh, during his detention in solitary confinement he was tortured
    physically and psychologically to confess. His interrogators tortured him
    by flogging his waist and legs, using anelectrical prod, and connecting
    electrical current to his head. According to the same source, in 2014 Mr.
    Shahbakhsh was taken to the Intelligence Ministry Detention Center for a
    short period and threatened that he will be executed if he refused to
    collaborate with the authorities. Trial Branch One of the Islamic
