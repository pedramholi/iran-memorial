    Trial No information is available on Mr. Tahernejad s trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Tahernejad was announced as murder. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.

    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Tahernejad. Defense No information is available on Mr. Tahernejad s
    defense. Judgment Mr. Ali Tahernejad was hanged, along with five others,
    at the Gohardasht Prison yard in Karaj on February 19, 2014.
