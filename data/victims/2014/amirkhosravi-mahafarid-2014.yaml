    The Economics Minister at the time declared him the country s industrial
    hero and said that he had created 10,000 jobs in Iran. News of Mr.
    Mahafarid AmirKhosravi s execution was announced on May 24, 2014 by state
    news agencies and official sources, including the website of the
    Prosecutor General s Office. Additional information about this case was
    gathered from published reports in the press and official news agencies on
    the adjudication process, interviews given by judicial authorities,
    interviews with Mr. AmirKhosravi s attorney and his wife, published
    reports of trial sessions, and other sources.* Mr. AmirKhosravi was from
    the village of Nash of [the town of] Rudbar, married, with two children.
    His father was a well known and wealthy figure in Rudbar and owned dozens
    of acres of agricultural land. (Mehregan AmirKhosravi s letter, May 10,
    2012). According to Mr. AmirKhosravi s spouse, he was a quiet,
    introverted, and solid man. He was not after other people s [property] and
    liked helping others and the people around him. He liked creating jobs and
    hoped to one day become president. (Qanun Newspaper, April 21, 2013). Mr.
    AmirKhosravi had been a civil engineering student at [the city of] Zanjan
    Islamic Azad University. He did not finish college and started his
    business activities in the early 1990 s by buying and selling agricultural
    products. He expanded his activities by starting a cattle farm,
    establishing Rasekh Chub Company in [the village of] Siahkal in 1996-97,
    the Loshan Steel and Iron Company in 2002-2003, and Damash Spring Water
    Company in 2002-2003, with his brothers. They started the Amir Mansur Arya
    Investment Company in 2006-2007 with a 50 million Tuman initial capital
    investment, which had increased to 20 billion Tuman by 2008-2009. In the
    years that followed, Amir Mansur Arya Investment Company started or
    acquired close to 40 companies and manufacturing and investment complexes.
    For instance, in 2010-2011, in the course of privatization of state-owned
    companies, Mr. AmirKhosravi acquired 94.96 percent of Machine Sazi
    Lorestan s stock, 95.2 percent of Fulad Iran Industrial Group s stock, 95
    percent of Railroad Line Engineering and Technical Structures (Traverse)
    stock, and 39.5 percent of Khuzestan Fulad Exin, as well as contracts for
    tens of major governmental projects, and was thus able to acquire great
    wealth and have the support of high-ranking government authorities and
    members of parliament. (Hamshahri Online, May 24, 2014). In 2013, Forbes
    Magazine ranked Mr. AmirKhosravi the 290thwealthiest man in the world.
    (Jahan News, May 24, 2014). The Ahmadinejad administration s Economics
    Minister declared him the country s industrial hero and said that he had
    created 10,000 jobs in Iran. (Kalemeh, May 24, 2014). Case Summary In
    July-August 2011, a case was opened in [the city of] Ahvaz Prosecutor s
    Office regarding embezzlement at Ahvaz Bank Saderat, resulting in the
    arrest of the Bank Saderat s branch manager as well as Amir Mansur Arya
    Investment Company s chief [in-house] legal counsel and his deputy. These
    arrests constituted the start of a case that was labeled the most
    unprecedented financial embezzlement and corruption case in the history of
    Iran, and received extensive national and international coverage. As the
    case picked up steam, it was transferred to the Tehran Prosecutor s
    Office, and judicial investigations continued. Issuing special orders, the
    Head of the Judiciary put the country s Prosecutor General in charge of
    supervising the investigation, and designated Judge Seraj, the Prosecutor
    General s Security Deputy, as the special investigating judge. According
    to the case file, 2,800 billion Tuman were embezzled from the country s
    banking network between 2009 and 2011-12. These acts of embezzlement had
    been conducted by Bank Saderat Iran and also involved six other banks
    (Bank Melli, Bank Saman, Bank Sepah, Bank of Industry and Mine, Bank
    Parsian, and the about to be established Bank Arya). In the course of
    investigations, Khavari, Bank Melli Iran s president, left Iran before he
    could be arrested, and Bank Saderat s president was fired. According to
    people in charge of the case, at least 500 individuals, including 200
    accused, were investigated, resulting in at least 50 arrests. In the
    course of investigations, the names of many high-ranking officials and
    members of parliament were mentioned as accused, witnesses, or people with
    information, including the head of the Inspection Organization, the former
    Head of the Judiciary, the Expediency Council Secretary, the
    then-President s Chief Administrator, the former Minister of
    Transportation and Roads, the former Minister of Industries, the Deputy
    Minister of Industries, the former Deputy President of the Central Bank,
    the former Deputy Minister of Economics, the former Deputy Minister of
    Transportation and Roads, several members of the Islamic Consultative
    Assembly ( Majless or Parliament), and the children of several other
    members
