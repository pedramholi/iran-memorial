    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan Gholami, son of Gholam, was published
    on the websites of Fedaghnews, the official popular website of the Fedagh
    Rural District, on March 2 and 3, 2014, and Larestannews on March 3, 2014.
    He was from the Khalili Village in Fars province. His case was related to
    the murder of his uncle during a fight in 2006, when Mr. Gholami was only
    14 years old. International laws have strictly prohibited capital
    punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr. Gholami was detained for 7 years
    in various prisons in Shiraz. The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Gholami
    s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Gholami was announced as
    murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Gholami. Defense Mr. Gholami was less than 18 when
    arrested. No information is available on his defense. Judgment Mr. Hassan
    Gholami was hanged in Shiraz on March 2, 2014. The execution took place
    without informing his family. After the execution, his family was
    contacted to receive the body in Shiraz. They took the body from Shiraz to
    the Khalili Village for burial.
