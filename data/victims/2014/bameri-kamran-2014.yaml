    News of the execution of Mr. Kamran Bameri, along with four others, was
    published on the website of the Human Rights and Democracy Activists in
    Iran on August 9, 2014. Arrest and detention Mr. Bameri was detained for
    more than 2 years in Section 7 of the Zahedan Central Prison. He had been
    transferred, along with five other prisoners, to solitary confinement in
    the Quarantine Section on August 7, 2014. The circumstances of his arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Bameri s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Bameri was
    announced as possession of narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Bameri. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Bameri s defense. Judgment Mr. Kamran
    Bameri was hanged, along with four others, in the Zahedan Central Prison
    on August 9, 2014.
