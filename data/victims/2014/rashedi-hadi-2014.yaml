    He was forty, a chemistry teacher who volunteered to teach destitute
    children Information about Mr. Hadi Rashedi was obtained from an interview
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) with an eye
    witness, and member of the Al-Hiwar organization and through a report of
    the Justice for Iran organization (Conversation with Death, February-March
    2013); Amnesty International s Bulletin (December 9, 2013); a Human Rights
    Watch report (January 24, 2013); the United Nations Special Rapporteur s
    Report (January 24, 2013); and from news websites, including HRANA (HRANA,
    December 30, 2013), as well as from a letter written from inside Karun
    Prison by Mr. Hashem Sha baninejad (Mr. Rashedi s friend, colleague, and
    co-defendant.) Mr. Hadi Rashedi was from Ramshir (Khalafieh), a town
    located to the south of Ahvaz. He was 40 years old, a [high school]
    chemistry teacher, and an Arab activist of Khuzestan [Province]. He held a
    Master s degree in applied chemistry and taught chemistry at Doctor
    Hessabi High School in the town of Sarbandar. One of his educational
    activities was to hold free classes for Arab students who were held back
    due to language differences, [not being Farsi speakers]. Mr. Rashedi was
    frail and thin and suffered from heart disease. He had, therefore, been
    exempted from performing [mandatory] military service. Mr. Rashedi was
    also a founder of the Al-Hiwar Scientific and Cultural Organization (
    Hiwar meaning Dialogue ) in Arabic, which was inspired by former President
    Khatami s slogan Dialogue among Civilizations, ) which had obtained
    temporary authorization [to operate] from the [offices of the] National
    Organization for Youth* in 2001-2002. Al-Hiwar held cultural programs in
    Arabic, as well as cultural and educational classes for the young people
    of [the town of] Ramshir. It was also active in promoting Arabic language
    and culture, as well as women s rights. The activities of the young
    members of the organization were very well-received by the people of
    Ramshir. As a result, in the second City Council elections in 2002-2003,
    all five candidates supported by Al-Hiwar were elected. (ABF s interview)
    Subsequent to street demonstrations by Iranian Arabs residing in Khuzestan
    [Province] in 2005-2006, the Al-Hiwar Organization was declared illegal.
    Mr. Rashedi and other members, however, continued their activities by
    establishing a library and holding study [groups and] meetings at their
    homes. Continuing these cultural activities led to the members being
    summoned and interrogated by the town s security apparatus. Between 2006
    and 2009, Mr. Rashedi and the other members of Al-Hiwar were summoned and
    interrogated numerous times by the Ministry of Information. (Justice for
    Iran) The security people accused them of promoting ethnic thinking and
    demanded an end to their meetings and study sessions. A Summary of the
    Khuzestan Protests Subsequent to the publication of a letter dated July
    24, 1998, ascribed to then-President Khatami s Chief of Staff, Mohammad
    Ali Abtahi, demonstrations protesting the letter broke out on Friday,
    April 15, 2005, first in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in other cities,
    such as Mahshahr and Hamidideh, and continued for several days. The letter
    emphasized the modification of Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab population
    through promotion and encouragement of the migration of non-native
    populations to the province, [thus] reducing Khuzestan s Arab population
    to one third of the total population of the province. Although the
    government s spokesperson officially denied [the existence of] this letter
    on Saturday, April 16, the demonstrations that had been called for by the
    Coordination Committee for Popular Protests in Ahvaz continued extensively
    in the coming days. In calling for demonstrations, [the organizers]
    highlighted various factors, including the central government s policies
    in expropriating Arab farmers lands for various projects such as sugar
    cane development, and marginalization of, as well as profound discontent
    among, Khuzestan s Arab [population], as a result of the regime s efforts
    to obliterate Arab identity. The demonstrations that had started in
    Shelangabad (Da ereh), one of [the city of] Ahvaz s poor neighborhoods,
    quickly spread to the center of Ahvaz and to the cities of Mahshahr and
    Hamidieh. Citing Ahvaz News (a regional news organization) and
    eyewitnesses at the scene, the Ahvaz Human Rights Organization s bulletin,
    dated April 15, 2005, stated, Around three thousand Arab people of Ahvaz
    have gathered together and started extensive but peaceful demonstrations
    in Kordovani Street and Square, along with thousands of others in
    neighborhoods such as Shelangabad, Malashieh, Ameri, and Kut Abdollah,
    among others. Security forces are attacking the demonstrators, first with
    tear gas, and are subsequently firing on them in Da ereh and Malashieh
    neighborhoods. The degree of violence resorted to by security and police
    forces in quashing the demonstrations was such
