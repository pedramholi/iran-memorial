    News of the execution of Mr. Yaser Abdi (Eidi), along with three others,
    was published on the website of the Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse,
    quoting the Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan Courthouse, and IRNA
    (Islamic Republic News Agency) on March 2, 2014, the Campaign in Defense
    of Civil and Political Prisoners on March 9, 2014, along with 11 others,
    and HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on September 21, 2015,
    along with 12 others. Mr. Abdi (Eidi) was from Minab and only 16 when the
    crime took place. (HRANA) International laws have strictly prohibited
    capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time
    of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention According to the Public Relations
    Office of the Hormozgan Courthouse, Mr. Abdi (Eidi) and several others
    were passing through a secret passage from Qal eh Ganj to Rudan when
    ambushed by official agents. After a clash with agents, two of them were
    killed and the rest were arrested (Hormozgan Courthouse). Mr. Abdi (Eidi)
    was detained for 3 years. (HRANA) The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Rudan
    tried Mr. Abdi (Eidi). No information is available on his trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Abdi (Eidi) was announced as armed
    transportation of 966 kilograms of opium. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Abdi
    (Eidi). Defense Mr. Abdi (Eidi) was under 18 when the crime took place
    (HRANA). No information is available on his defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Rudan condemned Mr. Yaser Abdi (Eidi) to death. The
    General Public Prosecutor signed the ruling, and he was hanged, along with
    three others, in Bandar-e Abbas Prison on March 2, 2014.
