    News of the execution of two men and a woman from Delfan including Ms./Mr.
    R. H., a resident of the Golestaneh Village in the Kakavand District, was
    published on the websites of Arshnews and Delfanemrooz on January 26,
    2014. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on Ms./Mr. R.
    H. s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on Ms./Mr. R.
    H. s trial. Charges The charges against Ms./Mr. R. H. were announced as
    "transportation and possession of 6 kilograms of heroin." The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against Ms./Mr. R. H.
    Defense No information is available on Ms./Mr. R. H.'s defense. Judgment
    Ms./Mr. R. H. was hanged in Delfan in January of 2014. No specific
    information is available about the defendant s execution.
