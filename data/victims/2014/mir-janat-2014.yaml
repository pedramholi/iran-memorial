    News of the execution of Mr. Janat Mir, along with five other Afghan
    citizens, was published on the websites of Azadiradio on May 5, and 8am on
    April 20, 2014. Additional information was taken from the websites of the
    BBC on April 19, Armanemeli on April 26, Gandhara on December 5, the
    Committee for Defense of Human Rights in Iran on June 26, and Tolonews on
    April 21, 2014. According to Tolonews, the speaker for the Afghanistan
    Foreign Ministry expressed concerns regarding the increase in the
    execution of Afghans in Iran and stated that Iran should consult
    Afghanistan about decisions on Afghan prisoners, and allow them to benefit
    from their country s consular services. Afghanistan has requested several
    times that Iran reduce the death sentence of Afghans to life imprisonment.
    According to the Gandhara website, Amnesty International, based in London,
    also expressed concern regarding the increase in the execution of Afghans
    in Iran and reported that at least 700 Afghan citizens had been executed
    in Iran in 2013. This is an increase compared to 544 executions in 2012.
    In addition, 250 individuals were executed during the first four months of
    2014. Mr. Janat Mir was from Volsovali Kolfgan in Takhar, Afghanistan.
    According to Azadiradio, quoting his brother, Mr. Janat Mir went to school
    until ninth grades and went to Iran in search of work in 2012. During this
    interview his brother stated Mr. Janat Mir s age as 15; however, according
    to the Committee for Defense of Human Rights in Iran, he was 17 years old
    when executed. International laws have strictly prohibited capital
    punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and Detention According to the Gandhara website,
    the Iranian authorities informed Mr. Janat Mir s family of his sentence a
    few months after he entered Iran. According to Azadiradio, quoting his
    brother, Mr. Janat Mir was detained for two years at the Dastgerd Prison
    in Esfahan. During his radio interview, he went to Iran to visit his
    brother; however, he was not allowed to visit him during the two months
    period that he stayed. There is no specific information on the defendant s
    arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on Mr. Janat Mir s
    trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Janat Mir was announced as "drug
    trafficking." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Janat Mir. Defense During an interview with
    Azadiradio, Mr. Janat Mir s brother stated that his brother had no
    attorney and did not benefit from a fair trial. No information is
    available on his defense. A Summary of the Legal Defects in the
    Adjudication of Mr. Jannat Mir s Case According to certain reports, Jannat
    Mir committed the alleged crime at the age of 15. Pursuant to Iran s
    Islamic Penal Code, the age of criminal responsibility is when an
    individual reaches puberty. Furthermore, if Jannat Mir s age at the time
    of commission of murder was between 15 and 18, investigations should have
    been conducted as to his mental development. By way of explanation, Jannat
    Mir was executed on April 15, 2014, when the new Islamic Penal Code had
    already been passed (April 2013) and was in force. Pursuant to the
    previous Islamic Penal Code which was in force at the time of the
    commission of the crime, the punishment for young adults (that is, boys)
    who have reached the age of 15, was no different than the one for adults.
    The Islamic Penal Code was changed, however, on April 21, 2013, and
    prescribed different rules for crimes committed by individuals under the
    age of 18. Although the new Code provides the same punishment for crimes
    that are subject to Hadd and Qesas for adults as well as for individuals
    under 18 who have attained puberty, if the individual under the age of 18
    is not aware of the nature of the crime, and there is doubt
