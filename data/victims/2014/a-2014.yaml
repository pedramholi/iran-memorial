    News of the execution of Mr. A., along with another person, was published
    in the Khorasan newspaper on February 22, 2014. He was married and his
    case was related to murdering a man and injuring his own wife by blows of
    a knife because of his suspicion of their affair in 2007. Arrest and
    detention Mr. A. was arrested by police at his house. He was detained for
    six years. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Branch Five of the Criminal Court of Khorasan tried Mr. A. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges According to the report,
    the charge brought against Mr. A. was announced as murder. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. A.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. A. s defense. Judgment Branch
    Five of the Criminal Court of Khorasan condemned Mr. A. to death. The
    Supreme Court and the Head of Judiciary confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged, along with another person, in the presence of the judge of
    Sentence Enforcement and other officials at Mashhad Central Prison on
    February 19, 2014.
