    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Feizollahi, along with another person,
    was published on the website of Oyannews on June 13, 2014. According to
    the existing information, he was from Meshkin Shahr and his case was
    related to a murder in 2008. Arrest and detention Mr. Feizollahi was
    detained for 6 years in Tabriz Central Prison. The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No other information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Feizollahi
    was announced as murder. According to the report, since there was not
    enough evidence presented against Mr. Feizollahi, the court found the case
    to be lowth . Pursuant to the judges request, the plaintiff introduced 50
    people to the court, all of whom swore qassameh * oaths to prove Mr.
    Feizollahi s murder charge. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Feizollahi s defense. Judgment On the basis of qassameh alone, the judges
    issued a death sentence ( qesas-e nafs ) for Mr. Ali Feizollahi.
    Accordingly, Mr. Ali Feizollahi was hanged at the Tabriz Central Prison
    yard on June 7, 2014. ---------------------------------------- * Qassameh
    means an oath taken by a group of people. It is one of the ways that a
    defendant s guilt or innocence can be proven for both intentional and
    non-intentional offenses. Per Iran s Islamic Penal Code, qassameh is
    carried out in instances where a crime has occurred and no convincing
    evidence or witnesses exist which could prove the defendant s guilt, and
    where a judge has doubt about the defendant s guilt based solely on
    circumstantial evidence a circumstance referred to in religious
    jurisprudence as lowth. Where lowth obtains, the judge is bound to ask the
    defendant to produce evidence disproving the charge. If the defendant
    demonstrates his innocence in this way, he is acquitted. Failing this, the
    plaintiff may perform qassameh in order to prove the defendant s guilt, or
    request that the defendant perform qassameh to disprove the charges. This
    procedure, which requires a defendant to prove his innocence, is contrary
    to the principle of presumption of innocence and violates the defendant s
    right to remain silent. The principle of the presumption of innocence -
    recognized in Iran s constitution, Code of Criminal Procedure, and
    international agreements to which Iran is signatory holds that all persons
    are to be considered innocent until proven guilty. A defendant should not
    be made to prove his own innocence. Proving the charges made against the
    defendant by presenting adequate evidence and witnesses is the duty of the
    prosecuting authority (in the Iranian context, the public prosecutor or a
    private plaintiff.) The right to remain silent is among the defendant s
    rights of defense, affording him the right to refrain from answering
    questions regarding the charges entered against him. Such silence may not
    be treated as an indication or evidence of guilt or innocence. In order to
    substantiate a charge of homicide through qassameh, an oath is required
    from 50 male relatives of the plaintiff. For the charge to be dismissed,
    fifty male relatives of the defendant must swear to his innocence. Should
    the number of male relatives taking the oath be less than 50, the
    defendant may repeat the oath himself in order to meet the required number
    of swears. In homicide cases, it is not possible for a plaintiff to repeat
    the oath in this way. It is not necessary for those taking the oath to
    have witnessed the commission of the crime themselves. In Hanafi
    jurisprudence, qassameh can only be carried out to disprove charges
    against a defendant, and a plaintiff may not use it to substantiate a
    defendant s guilt. In Shi a jurisprudence, however, qassameh is carried
    out in the first stage by the plaintiff to prove the charges against the
    defendant. Only where the plaintiff foregoes qassameh and requests that
    the defendant perform it himself, can the defendant use qassameh to see
    his charges dismissed.
