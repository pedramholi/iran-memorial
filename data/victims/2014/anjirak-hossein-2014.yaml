    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Anjirak, along with three others, was
    published on the website of the Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse, quoting
    the Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan Courthouse, and IRNA (Islamic
    Republic News Agency) on March 2, 2014, and the Campaign in Defense of
    Civil and Political Prisoners on March 9, 2014, along with 11 others.
    Arrest and detention According to the Public Relations Office of the
    Hormozgan Courthouse, Mr. Anjirak and several others were passing through
    a secret passage from Qal eh Ganj to Rudan when ambushed by official
    agents. After a clash with agents, two of them were killed and the rest
    were arrested (Hormozgan Courthouse). The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Rudan
    tried Mr. Anjirak. No information is available on his trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Anjirak was announced as armed transportation
    of 966 kilograms of opium. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Anjirak. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Anjirak s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Rudan condemned Mr. Hossein Anjirak to death. The
    General Public Prosecutor signed the ruling, and he was hanged, along with
    three others, in Bandar-e Abbas Prison on March 2, 2014.
