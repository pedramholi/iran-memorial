    News of the execution of Mr. Osman Dahmardeh, along with four others, was
    published on the website of the Human Rights and Democracy Activists in
    Iran on August 9, 2014. He was less than 18 years old at the time of the
    committed crime. International laws have strictly prohibited capital
    punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr. Dahmardeh was arrested, along
    with his mother, when he was only 17 years old. He was detained for more
    than 2 years in Section 1, known as the Youth Section, of the Zahedan
    Prison. He had been transferred, along with five other prisoners, to
    solitary confinement in the Quarantine Section on August 7, 2014. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Dahmardeh s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Dahmardeh was announced as possession of narcotics.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Dahmardeh. Defense Mr. Dahmardeh was less than 18
    when arrested. No information is available on his defense. Judgment Mr.
    Osman Dahmardeh was hanged, along with four others, in the Zahedan Central
    Prison on August 9, 2014. His mother was executed along with him.
