    News of the execution of Mr. Rahim Nurollahzadeh, along with four others,
    was published on the website of Campaign in Defense of Civil and Political
    Prisoners and, along with another person, on the website of
    Nafas-dar-Qafas on November 30, 2014. His case was related to the murder
    of his friend during a street fight in 2009 when he was under 14 years
    old. International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment
    against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the
    crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
    Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid
    capital punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen.
    Arrest and detention According to the website of Nafas-dar-Qafas, Mr.
    Nurollahzadeh was detained for five years. The Campaign in Defense of
    Civil and Political Prisoners reported that he was tortured physically and
    psychologically. However, the circumstances of his arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Nurollahzadeh s
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Nurollahzadeh was announced
    as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Nurollahzadeh. Defense Mr. Nurollahzadeh was under
    18 when the crime was committed. No information is available on his
    defense. Judgment Mr. Rahim Nurollahzadeh was hanged at Tabriz Central
    Prison on November 25, 2014. No specific information is available about
    this execution.
