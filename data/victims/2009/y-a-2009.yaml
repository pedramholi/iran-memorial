    The execution of Mr. A.Y. was reported by Kayhan Newspaper (February 17,
    2009) and Ettehad-e-Jonoub News and Commentary Website (February 18,
    2009). According to available information, Mr. A.Y. s case was related to
    a murder. Arrest and detention According to available information, the
    police arrested Mr. A.Y., when a body was discovered in one of the
    villages near Borazjan (Kayhan Newspaper). However, the detailed
    circumstances of Mr. A.Y. s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on this trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. A.Y. was murder in the first degree . He was accused of killing Mr.
    Amru llah M.Y. , because of a financial dispute. He had taken this man to
    one of the villages around Borazjan, killed him, and abandoned the victim
    s car in the streets of Borazjan (Kayhan Newspaper). There is no
    information on the details of these charges. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to available records, the
    verdict against Mr. A.Y. was his own confession, elicited during police
    interrogation and investigation (Kayhan Newspaper). The report of this
    execution does not contain any information regarding other evidence
    providedagainst the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    A.Y. s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr. A. Y. to death by hanging
    (Retribution) (Kayhan Newpaper). Mr. A. Y. was executed on the morning of
    February 17, 2009, at the Central Prison of Bushehr. The family of the
    victim were in attendance. There is no information on the details of the
    verdict leading to this execution.
