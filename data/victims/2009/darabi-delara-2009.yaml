    News of the execution of Ms. Delara Darabi on May 1, 2009, was announced
    on the official news agencies ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) and IRNA
    (Islamic Republic News Agency) and most newspapers in Iran such as E temad
    , Khabar-e Jonub , Iran , Kayhan , Sarmayeh , and E temad-e Melli .
    Additional information was taken from interviews and articles published by
    Abdolsamad Khorramshahi and Mohammad Mostafa i, Ms. Darabi s attorneys,
    and Asieh Aminin, a journalist who followed this case closely. These
    reports were reflected in various media, such as BBC , Radio Farda , Radio
    Zamaneh, and their personal weblogs. (The full list of resources is at the
    bottom.) Ms. Delara Darabi was born in Rasht on September 29, 1986. She
    was an artist who began painting when she was ten years old. Before her
    arrest, at the age of seventeen, she was a pre-college student. During Ms.
    Darabi s detention period, many artists and civil and human rights
    activists organized a campaign to free her. They asked the head of the
    Judiciary (Head of Iran s Judiciary) to prevent her death, due to her age,
    her psychological condition, and various ambiguities of the case. An
    exhibition of this young woman s paintings in September of 2006 attracted
    more attention to her case and increased the demand to nullify the death
    penalty ruling. In a statement published on May 1, 2009, Amnesty
    International considered the execution of Ms. Darabi in violation of
    international standards and norms. Arrest and detention Ms. Delara Darabi
    was arrested by police and transferred to the Rasht prison on December 28,
    2003, at night. According to various reports, on this day, Ms. Darabi and
    her boyfriend, Amirhossein Sotudeh, entered a house belonging to a cousin
    of Ms. Darabi s father, for robbery. The landlord was murdered by several
    blows of a knife after receiving a knockout blow by a baseball bat. Ms.
    Darabi and Mr. Sotudeh escaped after robbing the safe of the house.
    However, Ms. Darabi left her bag there, and her boyfriend refused to
    return to the victim s house and take it. Therefore, she called her
    ex-suitor, Sa id, for help. Sa id went to the house and brought back the
    bag, but he also contacted Ms. Darabi s father, who called the police.
    Finally, both Delara and Amirhossein were arrested. The case of Ms. Delara
    Darabi was sent to Branch 10 of the Rasht Courthouse for arraignment the
    next day, December 29, 2003. Reconstruction of the murder scene took place
    on December 30, 2003. She was denied access to an attorney during the
    first days of her detention. Ms. Delara Darabi had several physical and
    psychological problems while in detention for years. Once, she attempted
    suicide in February of 2007. According to her family, all requests to
    treat her physically and psychologically outside of the prison were
    rejected. Trial Ms. Delara Darabi was tried in various courts. Her first
    trial took place at Branch 10 of the Rasht Courthouse on January 15, 2004,
    only 18 days after her arrest. The court condemned her with an unusual
    expediency that was rare at the time. Ms. Darabi s father hired a
    well-known attorney in Rasht for the first trial. However, the attorney
    was not present during the first session, where all other defendants and
    their attorneys were present, in addition to the victim s family. Ms.
    Darabi s case was sent to various courts to be investigated. The Supreme
    Court confirmed the ( first trial) court ruling for the first time on
    September 3, 2004. However, in order to investigate the pills taken by the
    defendant and the fact that she was under 18 years old, the Supreme Court
    referred the case to Branch 107 of the Public Court of Rasht ( Juvenile s
    Branch). This branch investigated the case in two sessions. The first
    session took place on December 6, 2004, and Ms. Darabi s attorney was not
    present. The next session, with her attorney present, took place on
    February 9, 2005. ( Iran newspaper: December 24, 2005) The second hearing
    of Ms. Darabi s case took place at Branch 107 of the Public Court of Rasht
    (Juvenile s Branch) presided by Judge Javidnia on June 15, 2006. Charges
    The charges against Ms. Delara Darabi were, the murder of Mahin Darabi on
    December 28, 2003, robbing her house, and having an illicit relationship.
    Evidence of guilt According to the head of Public Relations of Gilan
    Courthouse, Delara Darabi was condemned to death for committing murder,
    confessing to it, and recovering bloody money under her bed. (IRNA, Gilan,
    May 5, 2009) Defense A few days after her arrest, while waiting for her
    trial, Ms. Delara Darabi wrote a letter to the case judge and claimed her
    innocence. She wrote, I accepted the responsibility for the murder only
    because of my feeling for Amir and all his promises. I don t believe in
    any of my statements. ( Iran newspaper on December 24, 2005) She also
    rejected all her previous confessions about the murder during the court
    session on January 15, 2004. She claimed that Amirhossein had given her
    some tranquilizing pills,
