    The execution of Mr. Esma il Qaderi, along with another person, was
    reported by the Ministry of Justice of the Province of Sistan va
    Baluchestan Website (June 20, 2009) and Radio Baluchi. According to
    available information, Mr. Qaderi s case was related to drugs. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Qaderi s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial The Zahedan Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal put Mr. Qaderi on
    trial (Ministry of Justice of the Province of Sistan va Baluchestan). No
    information is available on this trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Qaderi was transportation and possession of narcotics, specifically
    heroin . The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence providedagainst the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Qaderi s defense. Judgment The Zahedan Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Qaderi to death by hanging . This
    verdict was approved by the Supreme Court (Ministry of Justice of the
    Province of Sistan O Balechustan). Mr. Qaderi, along with another person,
    was executed on the morning of Saturday June 20, 2009.
