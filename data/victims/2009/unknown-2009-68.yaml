    The news of the execution of an unknown individual along with two others
    was announced by the website of the provincial Ministry of Justice office
    in Khuzestan on February 19, 2009. According to the available information,
    this unknown individual s case pertains to murder. Arrest and Detention
    There is no information available on the details of this unknown

    by the Public Court of Khuzestan Province. However, there is no
    information available on the session or sessions of his trial. Charges
    This unknown individual was charged with murder. However, there is no
    information available on the details of his charge. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence entered against this unknown individual.
    Defense There is no information available on the details of this unknown
    individual s defense. Judgment The Khuzestan court sentenced this unknown
    individual to death. This unknown individual was hanged in Ahvaz Central
    Prison on March 20, 2009.
