    was shot and died during clashes following the presidential election of
    2009. Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Mr. Sa'id Abbasi
    Fargolchi, son of Sattar, was obtained from the website of HRANA - Human
    Rights Activists News Agency (June 21, 2009). Additional information was
    gathered from the websites of the Iranian Association of Political
    Prisoners (July 16, 2009), Green Wave of Freedom (July 28, 2009),
    Parliament News (November 7, 2009), Radio Farda (July 13, 2014), and a
    post by user Farshad on the X platform (April 8, 2019). According to
    available information, Mr. Sa'id Abbasi Fargolchi was a 24-year-old single
    young man who lived in the Punak neighborhood of Tehran. He owned and ran
    a bag and shoe store named "Aram" on South Rudaki (Salsabil) Street,
    Daneshgah Street, with his father (HRANA, June 21, 2009; Iranian
    Association of Political Prisoners, July 16, 2009). After the outbreak of
    the protests known as the "Green Movement" following Iran's 2009
    presidential election, Mr. Abbasi Fargolchi joined demonstrators on Rudaki
    Street in Tehran. 2009 Election - Background Election returns from Iran s
    June 12th, 2009, presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
    re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote. Following the announcement,
    citizens disputing these official results demonstrated in the streets.
    Text messaging services were disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night
    before the election and remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until
    July 1st. On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a
    ban on any gathering of presidential candidates supporters throughout the
    country. The same evening, security forces made a show of strength,
    increasing their presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security
    at polling stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting
    results soon after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the
    Interior that the first returns would not be announced until after the
    morning prayer (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential
    candidates came out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were
    made public, to protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election.
    Candidates Mir Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i,
    Ahmadinejad s competitors in the race, contested the election, alleging
    many instances of fraud. They filed complaints with the Council of
    Guardians, the constitutional body charged with vetting candidates before
    elections take place and approving the results afterwards, requesting an
    annulment and calling for a new election. Before the Council of Guardians
    could review their claims, however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah
    Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad on his re-election. In the meantime,
    many people active in Karubi s and Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On
    June 15th, unprecedented demonstrations filled the streets of central
    Tehran, in which an estimated three million protestors participated,
    according to statements attributed to the mayor of Tehran. As the
    demonstrations were ending, paramilitary forces attacked the marchers,
    injuring and killing several people. To prevent such news from being
    broadcast, the Iranian government expelled foreign journalists from the
    country and banned news agencies from reporting on the events. Over the
    next three days, protesters took part in peaceful demonstrations in
    Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on June 19th after Ayatollah
    Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced his support for
    Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were responsible for any
    disorder and its consequences. Amnesty International stated that the
    speech gave legitimacy to police brutality. The next day and thereafter,
    police and plainclothes paramilitary groups attacked the protesters.
    Public gatherings of any kind were declared illegal, and police,
    motorcycle-riding special units wearing black uniforms and helmets, and
    plainclothes agents brutally enforced this restriction. Individuals in
    civilian clothing, commonly referred to as plainclothes forces, are used
    in the Islamic Republic to disrupt political and trade union activities,
    student events and gatherings, electoral initiatives, and protests. Armed
    with sticks and clubs, and sometimes with chains, knives, batons, or
    firearms, they emerge when the state decides to suppress dissent. These
    plainclothes forces move about freely, violently beating protesters and
    arresting them, while the police passively look on or actively cooperate
    with them. There is little information on the command structure and
    organization of such groups, whose members wear ordinary clothing rather
    than official uniforms and may be affiliated with the ministry of
    information, influential political groups, or the armed forces. Following
    the post-election demonstrations in June 2009, pictures of some
    plainclothes agents were posted on internet websites. Internet users
    helped to identify some of them and provided
