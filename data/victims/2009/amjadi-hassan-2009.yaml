    The news of the execution of Mr. Hassan Amjadi along with the three other
    defendants in this case was announced by the websites of Iran Human Rights
    (April 28, 2009) and Kurdistan Media (January 27, 2009). Additional
    information regarding this case was obtained from the interview conducted
    by Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with a former fellow inmate of the
    executed individual. Mr. Amjadi was from Hamadan. According to the
    available information, his case pertains to abduction and rape (Kurdistan
    Media, January 27, 2009). Arrest and Detention There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Amjadi s arrest and detention. He spent
    five years in prison (Kurdistan Media, January 27, 2009). Trial There is
    no information available on the session or sessions of Mr. Amjadi s trial.
    Charges According to the available information, Mr. Amjadi was charged
    with abduction and rape (Kurdistan Media, January 27, 2009). However,
    there is no information available on the details of the charges brought
    against him. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no
    information available on the details of the evidence entered against Mr.
    Amjadi. Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr.
    Amjadi s defense. Judgment Mr. Hassan Amjadi was hanged along with the
    three other defendants in this case in Sanandaj Central Prison some time
    during the winter of 2009 (Iran Human Rights, April 28, 2009; Kurdistan
    Media, January 27, 2009). However, there is no information available on
    the exact date of this execution.
