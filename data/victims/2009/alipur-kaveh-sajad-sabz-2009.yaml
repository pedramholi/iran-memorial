    Kaveh Sabz Alipur s father: "My son was not a Basij member. He was just an
    ordinary citizen who dreamed of becoming an actor. Unfortunately, he
    became a victim of political games. Information regarding the arbitrary
    execution of Mr. Kaveh (Sajad) Sabz Alipur, son of Yusef, has been
    gathered from reports published in The Wall Street Journal (June 23,
    2009), Jaras (Green Path of Hope) (July 5, 2010), Rooz Online (June 15 and
    20, 2010), Radio Farda (November 29, 2013), Sarmayeh Newspaper (May 19 and
    26, 2009), Where Is My Vote website (April 25, 2010), ILNA News Agency
    (May 19, 2009), Fars News Agency (June 11, 2010), HRANA (July 28, 2009),
    and the Ebtekare Sabz blog (September 19, 2014). Mr. Kaveh (Sajjad) Sabz
    Alipur was born in 1985 and lived in Tehran. He was the eldest of three
    children, with two younger sisters. His father was a disabled veteran of
    the Iran-Iraq War and worked as a janitor in a building with physicians'
    offices on Vali-e Asr Street. The family lived in the basement of the same
    building. (Radio Farda, November 29, 2013). Kaveh was shy, polite, and
    energetic. He often wore colorful, stylish outfits that matched his taste.
    He was passionate about cinema and aspired to become an actor. During his
    military service, he took acting courses and appeared in several
    television productions that had not aired by the time of his death.
    According to his family, he was only one week away from his wedding when
    he was killed. (The Wall Street Journal, June 23, 2009; Green Initiative
    Blog, September 19, 2014). Mr. Sabz Alipur was socially and politically
    active. On May 1, 2009, he participated in the International Workers Day
    rally at Laleh Park in Tehran, where he was arrested. In the days leading
    up to the June 2009 presidential election, he and his sisters were seen
    wearing green wristbands in support of opposition candidate Mir-Hossein
    Mousavi. According to his mother, he approached the demonstrations with
    indescribable enthusiasm. At the beginning of the public protests against
    the election results, he joined some of the gatherings with his father.
    However, as the security forces' crackdown intensified, his family
    prevented him from continuing to participate. (Jaras, July 5, 2010;
    Sarmayeh Newspaper, May 19, 2009; Where Is My Vote?, April 25, 2010). 2009
    Election - Background Election returns from Iran s June 12 th , 2009,
    presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63
    percent of the vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing these
    official results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging services were
    disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the election and
    remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st. On Election
    Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any gathering
    of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country. The same
    evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing their
    presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
    reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protesters took part in
    peaceful demonstrations in Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on
    June 19th after Ayatollah Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced
    his support for Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were
    responsible for any disorder and its consequences . Amnesty International
    stated that the speech gave legitimacy to police brutality. The next day
