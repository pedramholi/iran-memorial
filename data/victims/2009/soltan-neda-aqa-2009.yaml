Her mother says that Ms. Aqa-Soltan was a rebel. From the age of three, she never accepted control. She fought with the school authorities not to wear a chador and she won that battle... She was tormented that she couldn t swim in the sea and be herself in the street. She really suffered because of that forced hejab. She was courageous and frank. She loved Arab dancing, western and Turkish pop music and especially music of Googoosh, an Iranian pop singer (HBO documentary). She also liked to read. Her music teacher remembers that She was a person full of joy She was a beam of light. According to those close to her, Travel was her passion She took private classes to become a tour guide, including Turkish-language courses, friends said, hoping to someday lead groups of Iranians on trips abroad (LA Times). Ms. Aqa-Soltan studied Islamic philosophy at Tehran Azad University but she dropped out after only two semesters. Her sister explains, She used to say that the God they are teaching at these universities is different from the God I worship. The professor taught them about a vengeful God but Neda said, This is not my God. The God I worship, is a compassionate and loving God (HBO documentary). She thought that the 2009 presidential election would be futile. Only after seeing televised debates between the candidates, did she think the stakes were high and decided to vote. On election day (June 12, 2009), she went to three different polling stations, and saw that only representatives of Mr. Ahmadinejad were present. She protested and said that representatives of other candidates should also be present. She did not cast a vote. Once the election result were announced, she participated in demonstrations protesting the results. On June 20, 2009, Ms. Neda Aqa-Soltan was shot and killed by a plain-clothes agent on a motorcycle at 7:20 p.m. in the Kargar neighborhood of Tehran. That day, Ms. Aqa-Soltan attended the demonstration along with her music instructor. According to an eyewitness a medical doctor who was standing by her at the time of the shooting she was shot in the heart and died instantaneously, as bystanders filmed her death on cell phone cameras. Dr. Hejazi told a BBC reporter We heard that there were things going on in the street nearby; and there were protests going on. So we decided to go out and take a look. We walked through an alley called Khosravi to the main street Kargar where the protests were going on and the anti-riot police was coming by motorcycle towards the crowd... Neda and [a] man... were staying there among the crowd. All of a sudden, everything turned crazy because the anti-riot police threw tear-gases [sic] among people and the motorcycle started rushing towards people. People ran through the Khosravi Alley. We too, with my friends... ran to the intersection, the other end of the alley, the intersection with Salehi Street... And there, people were just standing. They did not know what to do, either to scatter, to leave, or to wait and see what happens. We heard a gunshot. Neda was standing one meter away from me... All of a sudden, I turned back and saw blood gushing out of Neda s chest... We had the impression that it [the bullet] had come from a rooftop. But later on... some people... actually took someone with a Basij card, and they said that he was on a motorcycle coming from the other way, hiding in the corner. Some people shouted that we caught him, we caught him. People went towards him and they disarmed him, and took out his identity cards, which was a Basij member. And he was shouting, because people were furious, and he was shouting I didn t want to kill her ... They just got him and they didn t know what to do with him. Some people said don t harm him; we are not killers, like them ... They said we can t even give him back to the police because they would just let him go He was just crying So they let him go They took his identity cards... I noticed that some people were taking photos of him (BBC, June 25, 2009). Large crowds attended Neda s memorial service on July 30, 2009 and gathered at her grave at Behesht-e Zahra Cemetery in Tehran. Po
