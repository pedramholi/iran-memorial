    The execution of Mr. Sa id, as the main defendant in two cases, along with
    four other people, was reported by the Iranian Student Correspondents
    Association-ISCA News, on October 21, 2009. Additional information was
    collected from ISCA News Website (February 5, 2008). According to
    available information, Mr. Sa id s case was related to a murder in
    Esfahan, in 2002, and a murder in Tehran, in 2005. Arrest and detention
    According to available information, Mr. Sa id was pursued and arrested in
    Shiraz, following an incident of murder (ISCA News, February 5, 2008). The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial Section 71
    of the Criminal Court of Tehran put Mr. Sa id on public trial. He was the
    main defendant in two cases of murder in the first degree. The trial was
    conducted by four judges and the District Attorney (ISCA News, February 5,
    2008). No information is available on this trial. Charges Section 71 of
    the Criminal Court of Tehran charged Mr. Sa id with two counts of murder
    in the first degree . He was accused of killing an 18-year-old victim with
    knife blows to the stomach, on July 22, 2002. He had approached this
    person and lured them to the deserted areas outside of Esfahan, where the
    murder was committed. He was also accused of being the main perpetrator in
    the murder of a 25-year-old man. His accomplice was the wife of this man.
    The murder took place in a building on Resalat Street in Tehran, in 2005
    (ISCA News, February 5, 2008). The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to available information, the basis for the sentence issued
    against Mr. As id was his confession. In court, he confessed to one count
    of murder in Esfahan, and another murder in Tehran. Also, a printout of
    the conversations between Mr. Sa id and the victim s wife was presented as
    evidence against him (ISCA News, February 5, 2008). Defense According to
    available information, in his own defense, Mr. Sa id testified that he had
    killed the victim in Esfahan, because he had molested his half-sister. The
    motive for the second murder was stated as revenge . According to reported
    information, the victim s wife and Mr. Sa id had grown up together, and
    were in love. However, her family had forced her to marry the victim. No
    information is available on his defense. Judgment Section 71 of the
    Criminal Court of Tehran sentenced Mr. Sa id to two executions . Section
    11 of the Supreme Court approved this verdict. Mr. Sa id was executed in
    Evin Prison, on the morning of Wednesday, October 21, 2009 (ISCA News,
    February 5, 2008 ??) There is no information on the verdict leading to
    this execution. The court also sentenced the wife of Mr. Malik iddin , as
    the accomplice, and for having a secret relationship with Mr. Sa id, to 10
    years in prison (ISCA News, February 5, 2008).
