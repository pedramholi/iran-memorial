    He had a high school diploma and was a mason s helper. News of Mr. Shuresh
    Mehdikhani s execution was published by the Human Rights Activists in Iran
    s (HRANA) website (August 12, 2009) and Kurdistan s Azarmehr Women s
    Association (July 31, 2009). Additional information about this case was
    obtained through Boroumand Center research and an interview with a person
    close to Mr. Mehdikhani and from Kurdistan Human Rights Organization s
    official website, Ensaniat (February 16, 2009). Mr. Shuresh Mehdikhani,
    child of Sa eed, was 26 years old, single, a Sunni Kurd, and resided in
    the city of Sanandaj s Namaki neighborhood. He had a high school diploma
    and worked with his father as a mason s helper. According to a person
    close to him, Mr. Mehdikhani was a religious man and an adherent of the
    Shafe i* branch of Islam, but did not belong to a particular group or
    organization. He was a quiet man and had a pleasant demeanor with his
    friends and family. Mr. Mehdikhani had ordinary and temperate religious
    views and did not argue about his beliefs with anyone; he simply invited
    people to read the Koran and study Sunni beliefs (Boroumand Center
    interview). Arrest and detention According to a person with knowledge of
    the case, on December 1, 2007, the police arrested Mr. Mehdikhani in Bimeh
    Iran Alley, next to Sanandaj s Azadi Square Bank Sepah, after he was
    wounded by the explosion of a sound bomb he had been carrying on his
    motorcycle. He spent twelve days at Sanandaj s Be sat Hospital after his
    arrest. Mr. Mehdikhani, who had lost one of his kidneys as a result of the
    explosion and had not completely recovered and was still reeling from his
    wounds, was then transferred to Sanandaj Information Administration
    Detention Center where he spent nine months. He first got a chance to
    contact his family very briefly three months after his arrest. During his
    detention, Mr. Mehdikhani rarely contacted his family, and visited his
    family only a few times, each time for less than 30 minutes and in the
    presence of the Information Administration forces. According to a person
    with knowledge of the case, he had become extremely weak during detention
    (Boroumand Center interview). He lost one of his kidneys because of the
    explosion Mr. Mehdikhani was transferred to Tehran s Evin Prison in August
    2008. He was subsequently transferred to Sanandaj Central Prison in
    November 2008 and was then able to retain an attorney (Boroumand Center
    interview). According to a person close to Mr. Mehdikhani, on the day of
    his arrest, Sanandaj Information Administration forces went to his home
    without prior notice and without showing a search warrant and confiscated
    his religious books and CDs after turning the house upside down. After
    searching the house, Information agents disrespected Mr. Mehdikhani s
    family and beat his father, and then arrested his younger brother and
    sister without an arrest warrant and took them to Sanandaj Information
    Administration. Mr. Mehdikhani s brother and sister were released without
    trial after two months and 15 days, respectively. Another brother of Mr.
    Mehdikhani s was arrested a short time after his arrest and was detained
    for 45 days (Boroumand Center interview). Trial Sanandaj Islamic
    Revolutionary Court Branch Two tried Mr. Mehdikhani in mid-December 2008.
    The trial was convened in the presence of Mr. Mehdikhani s attorney and
    lasted only 15 minutes (Boroumand Center interview and research). He was
    tried in 15 minutes Charges The Court charged Mr. Mehdikhani with
    Moharebeh and Efsad fel-Arz (Boroumand Center interview). According to a
    person close to Mr. Mehdikhani, possession of explosive materials,
    studying religion, and inviting people to Sunni beliefs, were among the
    charges brought against Mr. Mehdikhani (Boroumand Center interview). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations allude to reports according to
    which, in certain cases, the Islamic Republic of Iran s officials bring
    false charges against their opponents (including political, civil, and
    union activists, as well as ethnic and religious minorities) such as drug
    trafficking or commission of public or sexual crimes, and execute them
    along with other regular criminals. Hundreds of people are sentenced to
    death in Iran every year; however, the number of those who are sentenced
    to death based on these false charges is not known. Evidence of guilt
    According to a person with knowledge of the case, Mr. Mehdikhani s
    production of the sound bomb that went off while he was transporting it on
    his person, was among the evidence presented against him (Boroumand Center
    interview). There are no details of other evidence presented against him
    in court. Defense Based on available information, Mr. Mehdikhani s
    attorneys pointed to the following in their brief to the appellate court:
    He was subjected to and was influenced by misguided r
