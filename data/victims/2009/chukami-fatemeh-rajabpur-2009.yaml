    According to an eyewitness, "The gunfire directed at the kindergarten was
    so continuous and relentless that people fled in fear to nearby streets
    and couldn t stay beside the mother and daughter who had been shot to help
    them." Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Ms. Fatemeh
    Rajabpur Chukami has been obtained from the website of the Islamic
    Revolution Document Center (June 15, 2017), Iran Newspaper (June 18,
    2009), Fars News Agency (June 17, 2009), ISNA (October 12, 2009), and ILNA
    (August 26, 2009). Her name appears on several lists of those killed
    during the 2009 post-election protests. Details of the shooting at the
    Ashura Basij base on June 15, 2009, were also obtained through an
    interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC) with an
    eyewitness who was present at the scene. Additional information was
    gathered from Javan Online (January 15, 2011), Fars News Agency (June 17
    and 18, 2009), Green Path Movement (Jaras, July 16, 2010), Tasnim News
    Agency (December 30, 2014), Radio Farda (December 20, 2014), and the
    archived website Shams - Martyrs of the Green Movement. Ms. Fatemeh
    Rajabpor was a graduate student pursuing a master s degree in Educational
    Technology. She worked as an employee and teacher at the Avaye Baran
    kindergarten in Tehran. (Javan Online, January 15, 2011) No detailed
    information about Ms. Rajabpor s childhood or early life has been
    published. Ms. Rajabpor was the daughter of Ms. Sorur Borumand Chukami,
    another victim of the 2009 post-election protests. Her mother also worked
    at the same kindergarten. (Iran Newspaper, June 18, 2009; Fars News
    Agency, June 17, 2009) She came from a six-member family and had one
    sister and two brothers. (Javan Online, January 15, 2011) According to
    some pro-government sources, Ms. Rajabpor was a devout believer and went
    beyond her professional duties to support children at the kindergarten.
    "She didn t charge some families. For some, she even bought clothes. When
    some children got sick, she took them to the doctor at her own expense."
    (Javan Online, January 15, 2011) 2009 Election Protests Election returns
    from Iran s June 12th, 2009, presidential election declared Mahmoud
    Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote. Following the
    announcement, citizens disputing these official results demonstrated in
    the streets. Text messaging services were disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m.
    on the night before the election and remained unavailable for nearly three
    weeks, until July 1st. On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police
    announced a ban on any gathering of presidential candidates supporters
    throughout the country. The same evening, security forces made a show of
    strength, increasing their presence in Tehran s public squares to
    reinforce security at polling stations. Officials at election headquarters
    began reporting results soon after midnight, despite a statement from the
    Minister of the Interior that the first returns would not be announced
    until after the morning prayer (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of
    other presidential candidates came out into the streets on June 13th, once
    the results were made public, to protest what they believed to be a
    fraudulent election. Candidates Mir Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and
    Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors in the race, contested the
    election, alleging many instances of fraud. They filed complaints with the
    Council of Guardians, the constitutional body charged with vetting
    candidates before elections take place and approving the results
    afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for a new election. Before
    the Council of Guardians could review their claims, however, the Supreme
    Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad on his re-election.
    In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and Musavi s campaigns
    were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented demonstrations filled the
    streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated three million protestors
    participated, according to statements attributed to the mayor of Tehran.
    As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary forces attacked the
    marchers, injuring and killing several people. To prevent such news from
    being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled foreign journalists from
    the country and banned news agencies from reporting on the events. Over
    the next three days, protesters took part in peaceful demonstrations in
    Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on June 19th after Ayatollah
    Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced his support for
    Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were responsible for any
    disorder and its consequences. Amnesty International stated that the
    speech gave legitimacy to police brutality. The next day and thereafter,
    police and plainclothes paramilitary groups attacked the protesters.
    Public gatherings of any kind were declared illegal, and police,
    motorcycle-riding special units wearing black uniforms and helmets, and
    plainclothes agents brutally enforc
