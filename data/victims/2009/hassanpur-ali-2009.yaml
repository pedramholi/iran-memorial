    He worked hard, reflecting the pride he took in his family. His
    accountancy was in Tehran, where he also participated in a demonstration
    opposing the presidential election results. Information about Mr. Ali
    Hassanpur s killing was taken from an interview with his wife on Rooz
    Online on April 25, 2010, and eyewitness reports sent to Rooz Online on
    April 27, 2010, responding to Mr. Hassanpur s wife s demand to clarify the
    incident. The information regarding the shooting by the Ashura Basij Base
    on June 15, 2009, was taken from an interview by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation (ABF) with an eyewitness who was present at the scene. Mr.
    Hassanpur, son of Ja far, was born on March 5, 1961. He was an accountant
    and had two children. According to his wife, he was a hard working man and
    worked two shifts. He loved his family and his country and was a good
    human being. On June 15, 2009, he was shot in the head and died on Azadi
    Street in Tehran. According to eye-witness reports, he was shot near the
    Basij Base of Ashura, Battalion 117. On June 15, 2009, a demonstration to
    protest the result of the presidential election took place in Tehran.
    Several people were killed or injured by paramilitary forces of the Basij
    as the demonstration came to an end and people began to disperse. The
    Basij forces of Ashura, Battalion 117, opened fire on protesters from the
    rooftop and through the windows of their building located at the beginning
    of the Mohammad Ali Jenah Highway on the north side of Azadi Square. Video
    clips of these shootings, posted on YouTube, showed tens of protesters in
    front of this Basij building chanting slogans. Direct clashes between
    people and Basij forces were not seen in these clips. However, the videos
    clearly showed the Basij members shooting at people from the rooftop and
    through the windows; and gunshot noises could be heard as well as scenes
    of civilians moving injured people. During an interview with the ABF, an
    eyewitness present at the time of these shootings by Basij forces stated:
    The crowd was so huge that a large demonstration took place everywhere
    people went. Around 7:00 p.m., I walked north from Azadi Square towards
    the Ariashahr neighborhood. The crowd was chanting slogans We went far
    away from Azadi Square. The number of military forces on the streets
    wearing multi-colored clothes gradually increased. Black clothed agents
    were also present on the streets. There was a limited number of police. We
    walked for about 800 meters or a kilometer when I heard a noise. People
    said it was the sound of shooting. We turned around. It was not evident
    where the noise came from I heard the sound of a machine gun shooting a
    round of bullets and then heard single shots being fired. The crowd
    pointed towards one place. I saw a building that was crowded On the
    rooftop, Basij members were moving about, but it was not very clear what
    was going on. I turned back and saw a young boy who was shot in his side
    and was bleeding severely. This eyewitness emphasized that people nearby
    the Basij building were not armed. The exact number of victims in this
    incident is unknown. According to his wife, on the day of the incident,
    Mr. Hassanpur participated in a demonstration protesting the result of the
    presidential election. According to reports sent to Rooz Online by
    eyewitnesses on April 27, 2009, There were shots coming from the Basij
    building. Some people were shot and we were all running. We were running
    from the shooting when we heard a shot behind us. When we turned back, we
    saw that three individuals were shot. One of them was Ali. Two other
    eyewitnesses confirmed that three were shot. According to one of them, Mr.
    Hassanpur, whose picture was published as one of the first victims [of
    this incident], was shot in his face. He fell down, moving his fingers for
    an instant, and died quickly. Another eyewitness who, along with others,
    carried Mr. Hassanpur s body, stated: I did not see how he died. When I
    saw people trying to move him, I helped. We carried him until a taxi took
    him away along with another person who was also shot. But I don t know
    where and what happened next. The body of Mr. Hassanpur was given to the
    coroner three days after the incident on June 18, 2009. Authorities did
    not offer any explanation to the family regarding these three days.
    According to Rooz Online , on April 25, 2009, his naked body was given to
    the coroner and identified as an unknown person. Mr. Hassanpur s body was
    given to his family 104 days later. Mr. Hassanpur s wife stated that: A
    bullet hit his head. It entered below his right eye, at his cheek bone,
    and exited above his left ear. An autopsy was done but I objected since
    the bullet had [clearly] hit his head. But they [the officials] stated
    that this was routine and they had to perform the autopsy. In the morgue,
    Ali s body was naked except for the knee brace which he wore for knee
    pain. Officials Reaction On October 12, 2009, during an official ceremony,
