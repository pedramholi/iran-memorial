    Mr. Tufanpur father, husband, and motorcyclist approached the clashes in
    Azadi Square, leaving his brother on the outer edges. The family lost
    contact with him. Information about Mr. Amir Hossein Tufanpur was taken
    from websites of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on July 21,
    2009 and Radio Farda, quoting the website of Green Freedom Wave on July
    30, 2009. Mr. Tufanpur is also included on the list of Names and
    Specifications of 72 Martyrs of The Green Movement published by the top
    advisor of Mr. Mirhossein Musavi, the presidential candidate, on the Noruz
    website on September 4, 2009. Mr. Tufanpur, 32, was married and had a
    seven-year-old daughter. According to the published reports, on June 15,
    2009 around 8:30 p. m., he and his brother were passing by the Azadi
    Square riding a motorcycle. When Mr. Tufanpur saw the crowd and street
    clashes, he separated from his brother to find out what was happening. His
    brother, hearing the shootings, kept his distance from the crowd and went
    back home after waiting for awhile. He tried unsuccessfully to call his
    brother s cell phone. Hours later, an unknown person called the family of
    Mr. Tufanpur from the latter cell phone and informed them of the fact that
    he had been shot and transferred to the Rasul Hospital (Green Freedom
    Wave). According to the available information, after days of distress and
    checking various hospitals, including Rasul Hospital, Mr. Tufanpur s
    family finally identified his body at the forensic office in Kahrizak on
    June 19, 2009 (Green Freedom Wave). Mr. Tufanpur s body had various
    injuries including bullet wounds in the arm, side, and back. Also, his arm
    was broken and the back of his neck was black and blue. A deep wound in
    the back of his head, filled with cotton, was also reported (Names and
    Specifications of 72 Martyrs of the Green Movement). No information is
    available about how Mr. Tufanpur was killed after he was shot in his arm.
    Officials offered his family no information in this regard. He was buried
    in the Beheshte-Zahra cemetery in Tehran on June 21, 2009. Officials
    Reaction The Revolutionary Court officials first refused to return Mr.
    Tufanpur s body. According to his family, they asked for the payment of 5
    to 10 million Tomans as the bullet fine . Then, after efforts and follow
    up by Mr. Tufanpur s mother, officials accepted that he had not been
    political and only a passerby, and gave his body to the family without
    payment. According to Green Freedom Wave website, Mr. Tufanpur s body was
    given to his family with the condition of having no ceremonies at home or
    in any mosque. Officials from the judiciary promised Mr. Tufanpur s family
    that they would investigate the murderer or murderers crime. The family
    was also led to believe that they might even get Diyeh [blood money] if
    they content themselves to only followi the legal paths and (Green Freedom
    Wave) Background Election returns from Iran s June 12th, 2009,
    presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63
    percent of the vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing these
    official results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging services were
    disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the election and
    remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st. On Election
    Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any gathering
    of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country. The same
    evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing their
    presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
