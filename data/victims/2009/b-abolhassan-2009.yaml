    confess to the murder during the initial phase of police investigation and
    interrogation, nor did he make such a confession in court . According to
    the available information, during the court proceedings Mr. Abolhassan B.
    stated that the bullet he had fired had not hit the victim, and he
    therefore was not the murderer. He also added that during the dispute, his
    nephew had also been present with a gun, and that he might have been the
    one who murdered the victim. Judgment Branch Two of the Public Court of
    Firouzabad sentenced Mr. Abolhassan B. to death. Branch 26 of the Supreme
    Court approved the verdict. After the permission of the high-level
