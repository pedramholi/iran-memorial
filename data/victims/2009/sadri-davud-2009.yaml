    Security forces were visibly present at the hospital. Later, Davud Sadri s
    family was informed of his death. However, the authorities refused to
    release his body. Information regarding arbitrary execution of Davud
    Sadri, son of Ali Akbar, was gathered from the websites of Radio Farda
    (November 9, 2013), the Islamic Revolution Documents Center (June 15,
    2017), Amir Kabir Newsletter (July 30, 2009), the Human Rights Activists
    News Agency HRANA (July 30, 2009), Rooz Online (July 29, 2009, and June
    23, 2010), and the Green Path of Hope website quoting Saham News (July 30,
    2009), as well as videos posted on YouTube. Mr. Sadri s name also appears
    on numerous lists of people killed during the 2009 post-election protests.
    Information about the shootings at Basij Base No. 117 in Tehran s Meqdad
    District on June 15, 2009, was obtained through an ABC interview with an
    eyewitness who saw Mr. Sadri being shot at the scene. According to
    available information, Davud Sadri was born in Tehran in August 1983. He
    worked as an electrical technician at a pharmaceutical company on Fatemi
    Street in Tehran (Green Movement, July 16, 2010; Islamic Revolution
    Documents Center, June 15, 2017). He served as a warehouse and
    distribution supervisor at a pharmaceutical company. (Fars News Agency,
    June 30, 2009) Mr. Sadri s father, a retired employee of the Aerospace
    Industries Organization, said he was bedridden because of illness. He
    mentioned that his son Davud was the family s biggest support and "their
    entire world" (Green Movement, July 16, 2010). Mr. Sadri s mother recalled
    that they were a hardworking family, not involved in politics, and focused
    solely on their daily lives: "I raised my son through hardship" (Rooz
    Online, June 23, 2010). On June 15, 2009, Mr. Sadri participated in the
    protests in Tehran against the contested presidential election results.
    Event background ( 2009 Election) Election returns from Iran s June 12 th
    , 2009, presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with
    62.63 percent of the vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing
    these official results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging
    services were disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the
    election and remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st.
    On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any
    gathering of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country.
    The same evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing
    their presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
    reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protesters took part in
    peaceful demonstrations in Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on
    June 19th after Ayatollah Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced
    his support for Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were
    responsible for any disorder and its consequences . Amnesty International
    stated that the speech gave legitimacy to police brutality. The next day
    and thereafter, police and plainclothes paramilitary groups attacked the
    protesters. Public gatherings of any kind were declared illegal, and
    police, motorcycle-riding special units wearing black uniforms and
    helmets, and plainclothes agents brutally enforced this restriction.
    Individuals in civilian clothing, commonly referred to as plainclothes
    forces , are used in the Islamic Republic to disrupt political and trade
