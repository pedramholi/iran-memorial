    Ali Rajabpur Chukami, Sorur Borumand Chukami's son: "After entering
    kindergarten, I found my mother lying prostrate - already gone. My sister
    had collapsed nearby, her broken glasses still clinging to her face. They
    had been killed in silence, with no one there to help them." Information
    regarding the arbitrary execution of Ms. Sorur Borumand Chukami has been
    obtained from the website of the Islamic Revolution Document Center (June
    15, 2017), Iran Newspaper (June 18, 2009), Fars News Agency (June 17,
    2009), ISNA (October 12, 2009), and ILNA (August 26, 2009). Her name
    appears on several lists of those killed during the 2009 post-election
    protests. Details of the shooting at the Ashura Basij base on June 15,
    2009, were also obtained through an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center (ABC) with an eyewitness who was present at the scene.
    Additional information was gathered from Javan Online (January 15, 2011),
    Fars News Agency (June 17 and 18, 2009), Green Path Movement (Jaras, July
    16, 2010), Tasnim News Agency (December 30, 2014), Radio Farda (December
    20, 2014), and the archived website Shams - Martyrs of the Green Movement.
    Sorur Borumand Chukami was an employee and preschool teacher at Tehran's
    "Avaye Baran" kindergarten. No detailed information about her childhood,
    education, or personal life has been published. She was the mother of Ms.
    Fatemeh Rajabpur Chukami, another victim of the 2009 protests, who also
    worked at the same kindergarten (Iran, June 18, 2009; Fars News Agency,
    June 17, 2009). Ms. Borumand Chukami was married and had four children
    (Javan Online, January 15, 2011). Background Election returns from Iran s
    June 12 th , 2009, presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
    re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote. Following the announcement,
    citizens disputing these official results demonstrated in the streets.
    Text messaging services were disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night
    before the election and remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until
    July 1 st . On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced
    a ban on any gathering of presidential candidates supporters throughout
    the country. The same evening, security forces made a show of strength,
    increasing their presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security
    at polling stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting
    results soon after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the
    Interior that the first returns would not be announced until after the
    morning prayer (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential
    candidates came out into the streets on June 13 th , once the results were
    made public, to protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election.
    Candidates Mir Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i,
    Ahmadinejad s competitors in the race, contested the election, alleging
    many instances of fraud. They filed complaints with the Council of
    Guardians, the constitutional body charged with vetting candidates before
    elections take place and approving the results afterwards, requesting an
    annulment and calling for a new election. Before the Council of Guardians
    could review their claims, however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah
    Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad on his re-election. In the meantime,
    many people active in Karubi s and Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On
    June 15 th , unprecedented demonstrations filled the streets of central
    Tehran, in which an estimated three million protestors participated,
    according to statements attributed to the mayor of Tehran. As the
    demonstrations were ending, paramilitary forces attacked the marchers,
    injuring and killing several people. To prevent such news from being
    broadcast, the Iranian government expelled foreign journalists from the
    country and banned news agencies from reporting on the events. Over the
    next three days, protesters took part in peaceful demonstrations in
    Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on June 19 th after Ayatollah
    Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced his support for
    Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were responsible for any
    disorder and its consequences. Amnesty International stated that the
    speech gave legitimacy to police brutality. The next day and thereafter,
    police and plainclothes paramilitary groups attacked the protesters.
    Public gatherings of any kind were declared illegal, and police,
    motorcycle-riding special units wearing black uniforms and helmets, and
    plainclothes agents brutally enforced this restriction. Individuals in
    civilian clothing, commonly referred to as plainclothes forces, are used
    in the Islamic Republic to disrupt political and trade union activities,
    student events and gatherings, electoral initiatives, and protests. Armed
    with sticks and clubs, and sometimes with chains, knives, batons, or
    firearms, they emerge when the state decides to suppress dissent. These
    plainclothes forces move about freely, violently beating pr
