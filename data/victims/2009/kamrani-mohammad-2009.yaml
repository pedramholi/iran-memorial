    Young Mr. Kamrani, 18 years of age, getting ready for Azad University s
    entrance exam for med students. People who knew him under pressure admired
    his calm. Information about Mr. Mohammad Kamrani s death in detention was
    taken from websites of Iran Tabriz News on July 19, Association of Iranian
    Political prisoners (in Exile) on July 18, BBC Persian and the Committee
    of Human Rights Reporters on July 20, the E temad Melli newspaper on July
    23, the Kayhan newspaper on July 25, and ISNA (Iranian Students News
    Agency) on July 22 and 27, 2009. Additional information regarding
    detainees transferred to the Kahrizak prison was taken from an interview
    with an eyewitness. Mr. Mohammad Kamrani, an eighteen-year-old student who
    was going to participate in the Medical Entry Examination of the Azad
    University, was arrested during the protest demonstration in July 9, 2009.
    Mr. Kamrani s family finally was informed of his promised release on July
    15; however, when they went to the prison to take him, they were told that
    he had been transferred to the Loqman Hospital because of his injuries.
    The family went to this hospital but, according to a family member, they
    faced a half-dead body of Mohammad. Due to the family s insistence,
    officials escorted Mohammad to the Mehr Hospital but he died on the
    hospital bed several hours later. (BBC report) Arrest and detention
    According to Mr. Kamrani s family, he was arrested near Vali asr Square in
    Tehran during the clashes of July 9. He did not participate in protest and
    was only arrested when passing by a street. After his arrest, Mohammad,
    along with some other detainees, was transferred to the Kahrizak prison.
    His family had no information about him and his whereabouts during first
    few days. Several days later, officials of the Evin prison published a
    list of detainees who were transferred to the Evin prison from Kahriza and
    Mohammad Kamrani s name was among them. During an interview with ABF, an
    eye-witness said: Mohammad Kamrani was also a prisoner among us. We were
    all in Andarzgah, Section One. Kamrani was in room 5 on the second bed. He
    was nauseated. He was in a very bad condition and sick every day. Two days
    after we were taken to the Evin, he had been unconscious. You could see
    the black and blue marks on his body, his hands, and his arms. His
    shoulder was injured and infected. They took him to the Evin clinic. When
    we asked about him, they said he is in the clinic. I pretended to be sick
    and went to the clinic. Doctor said that he had died. They took him to a
    hospital and he died there. Kamrani was very calm and polite. He probably
    was 19 years old. This eye-witness added: when he and other detainees
    reached the Kahrizak prison, the prisoners were very thin and hungry and
    he was witness to the death of a prisoner. He was also hung by feet and
    beaten. This person described his observations as following: [When
    entering Kahrizak], they searched us and we entered the yard. They wrote
    down our names and forced us to take all our clothes off. We were all
    naked. They forced us to put our clothes in a garbage can. After 30
    minutes waiting naked, they began to beat us with a large hose and a stick
    in the yard It hurt a lot. Around 6 or 7 in the evening, they took us to
    Quaran [Quarantine] One. We were able to take a piece of clothing and put
    it around our waists. There were already people there [in the Kahrizak
    prison]. Some of them looked like starved Biafrans. They were very thin
    and hungry. There were so many of us and the capacity of the place was 20
    and we were about 160 people. So we couldn t sit. We had to sleep
    standing. Half of us sat and half of us stood. We were not allowed to go
    to the toilet. We all passed out several times. It was hot. There was a
    very small aeration opening and at night the smell of diesel came in.
    There were no windows. We banged on the door to get air and instead, they
    sent diesel in. We were very thirsty. Detainees asked for water but we
    only got 1 or 2 glasses of water every day. We got a little piece of bread
    and less than a quarter of a potato once a day. At 4:00 a. m. they would
    pour in and push us to the courtyard and beat us with the hoses. The third
    or the fourth day around 12 p.m., they took us to the courtyard. They made
    half of us to move on all fours around the courtyard while carrying the
    other prisoners on our backs. We had to carry them in a circle around the
    courtyard. The ground was so hot that we were burning. After five minutes
    I only saw blood on the ground from other people s knees and hands . We
    circled the courtyard maybe twenty or twenty-five times. If we stopped, we
    were being beaten. Everyone had fractured bones in different parts of
    their bodies . The environment was so dirty and hot that any injury got
    infected immediately. Everyone had infections . Guards had masks because
    of the smell . In Kahrizak, several people were unconscious. Officials
    could see that we may not survive. When detainees of July 9 entered the
    prison
