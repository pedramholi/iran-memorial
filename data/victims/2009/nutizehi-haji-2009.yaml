    was behind bars when a deadly explosion rocked a Zahedan mosque. He was
    put to death just hours later News of the execution of Mr. Haji Nutizehi,
    child of Esmail, and two other defendants in the case, was published by
    numerous sources, including the Sistan and Baluchestan Province Judiciary
    s website (June 1, 2009); the Islamic Republic of Iran Police Force news
    website (May 30, 2009); and Iranian Students News Organization (ISNA),
    Fars News Agency, and Taftan News Agency on May 30, 2009. Additional
    information about this case was obtained from Iran newspaper, Jam-e Jam
    online, and Radio Farda on May 30, 2009, and from other sources.* Based on
    available information, Mr. Nutizehi s case related to an explosion at the
    Imam Ali Mosque** in the city of Zahedan on May 28, 2009. Arrest and
    detention Information Administration agents arrested Mr. Nutizehi at
    Zahedan s Imam Ali Mosque on May 26, 2009 (BBC Persian and Jam-e Jam
    online, June 1, 2009, and Donyaye Eghtesad newspaper, May 31, 2009).
    Details of his arrest and detention are not available. Trial Mr. Nutizehi
    and his co-defendants were tried between Thursday night, May 28, and
    Saturday morning, May 30, 2009. The trial took place in the presence of
    his court-appointed attorney and the session was videotaped (ISNA, May 30,
    2009). No information is available about the details of the trial
    session/s. Haji Nutizehi was tried, sentenced to death, and executed in
    less than two days. Were judicial officials after justice, or revenge?
    Charges Mr. Nutizehi s trial was a mass trial with the other defendants in
    the case in which they were charged with complicity in the bombing of
    Zahedan s Imam Ali Mosque, complicity in the bombing of the Sarallah bus
    in 2006-07, complicity in the bombing of University Boulevard in 2006-07,
    attempted unsuccessful bombing of the February 10, 2009 demonstrations,
    explosion of a bomb in Zahedan s Alghadir Mosque in February 2009,
    complicity in the March 2009 operations in the Lar region, complicity in
    four counts of armed hostage-taking for purposes of extortion on behalf of
    the Rigi gang, planning eight counts of unsuccessful terrorist and
    hostage-taking operations, and procuring a team house in Zahedan to carry
    out various operations (Sistan and Baluchestan Province Judiciary, June 1,
    2009). No information is available about charges brought against Mr.
    Nutizehi individually. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    allude to reports according to which, in certain cases, the Islamic
    Republic of Iran s officials bring false charges against their opponents
    (including political, civil, and union activists, as well as ethnic and
    religious minorities) such as drug trafficking or commission of public or
    sexual crimes, and execute them along with other regular criminals.
    Hundreds of people are sentenced to death in Iran every year; however, the
    number of those who are sentenced to death based on these false charges is
    not known. Evidence of guilt Mr. Nutizehi s confession was the basis of
    his conviction and sentence (Iran-e Asr, May 30, 2009). The security
    forces investigations and reports were also among evidence presented him.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense Mr. Nutizehi had been arrested two days prior to the
    bombing. Furthermore, based on published reports, the perpetrator of the
    bombing was killed in the explosion (Iran newspaper, May 30, 2009).
    Baluchestan Popular Movement (Jondollah) *** issued a statement following
    the bombing claiming responsibility, and stated that it did not know Mr.
    Nutizehi, that he had no connections whatsoever with Jondollah, and that
    he had played no role in the Imam Ali Mosque bombing (Taftan, May 30,
    2009). Mr. Nutizehi s case was adjudicated within 30 hours of the
    explosion and his trial took place outside the legal framework of
    adjudication procedures. He was denied an attorney of his choosing and of
    sufficient time to prepare a defense. No information is available on Mr.
    Nutizehi s defense at trial. A Summary of the Legal Defects in the
    Adjudication of Mr. Haji Nutizehi s Case It can be said with utmost
    certainty that this case is one of the most flagrant cases of disregard
    for the principles of a fair trial. The defendant in the case was arrested
    on May 26, 2009. The bombing occurred on May 28, and the defendants were
    executed on May 30. The judicial authorities charged the defendants with
    complicity in the bombing of Zahedan s Imam Ali Mosque, complicity in the
    bombing of the Sarallah bus in 2006-07, complicity in the bombing of
    University Boulevard in 2006-07, attempted unsuccessful bombing of the
