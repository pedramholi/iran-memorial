    On Ashura Day, Ms. Sohrabi invited friends over to the house. She went out
    to collect provisions for the meal they would all share, maybe a lamb
    stew, some sweets. News of the killing of Ms. Shabnam Sohrabi, 34, was
    published on the Raye Ma Kojast website on May 12, 2010. The same report
    was also published on various websites. Ms. Sohrabi was run over by a
    security force vehicle during a street demonstration on Ashura Day,
    December 27, 2009. According to the Raye Ma Kojast report, an eyewitness
    was quoted as saying, A police vehicle hit Shabnam at a high speed and ran
    over her stomach several times. On December 27, 2009, Ms. Sohrabi and her
    friends were at her home on Shadman Street. According to a friend, Ms.
    Sohrabi went out around noon to buy the traditional food eaten on Ashura
    Day. Her friend left the house to go look for Ms. Sohrabi after she had
    not returned home by 5:00 p.m. After inquiring about Ms. Sohrabi, she
    found out that a woman with a similar build had been run over by a
    security force vehicle. When she went to the local police station, she
    confirmed that the victim was in fact Ms. Sohrabi. Ms. Sohrabi's friend,
    with the help of Ms. Sohrabi s six-year-old daughter, found Ms. Sohrabi s
    mother s house to inform her of her daughter s death. Ms. Sohrabi s mother
    was intimidated into silence by security forces for several months, but
    finally came out and stated: I went everywhere, including hospitals, and
    found out that Shabnam was transferred to the Rasul Hospital. But I heard
    no news of her and nobody was responsive until after twenty days they
    [authorities] called us at home and told us that my daughter s body was in
    the Kahrizak morgue. Ms. Sohrabi s body was then buried in Section 86 of
    the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery under tight security measures. The family was
    intimidated by security forces during the burial ceremony. According to
    her mother, Police surrounded Section 86 during the burial ceremony and
    reminded me several times that I should not say a word about Shabnam s
    killing. That was why I remained silent. According to the above report,
    Shabnam s death certificate stated the cause of death as, several injuries
    due to collision with a hard object and the subsequent side effects.
    Efforts by Shabnam s mother to identify this hard substance produced no
    result for months. She said: They ran over my daughter with a police
    vehicle but wrote the cause of death as collision with a hard substance .
    I want to know the name of this hard substance. She continued: They
    trampled over my daughter s body and now only God will answer my demands
    for Shabnam s rights. All my efforts to identify my daughter s murderer
    have had no result I know well that some day my daughter s killers will be
    identified and that day my pain and suffering might be assuaged. According
    to her mother, Ms. Sohrabi loved to travel and had travelled to many
    cities in Iran. Her mother remembers that, Shabnam liked to live. She had
    just completed her carpet knitting courses and had plans for her life. But
    they did not let her live. Shabnam had separated from her husband. She is
    survived by her six-year-old daughter, who lives with her grandmother now.
    Ms. Sohrabi s mother spoke about her granddaughter, saying: These days,
    she asks When will Mommy return? What answer can I offer her except to say
    that she has gone to heaven? She looks back at me with her sad eyes and
    says: Heaven is so far [away]. Officials Reaction No official has
    confirmed or denied the beating and killing of Ms. Sohrabi by the
    anti-riot police. Background Following the presidential election of June
    2009 and the widespread protests against its result, the government tried
    to prevent demonstrations by labeling them illegal and by violently
    suppressing demonstrators. Despite the intimidating circumstances,
    protesters poured into the streets on various religious and official
    anniversaries Qods Day, Ashura Day, the anniversary of the Iranian
    Revolution (February 11), and that of the occupation of the U.S. Embassy
    (November 14) rallying and marching to show discontent with the regime. On
    the Day of Ashura (December 27, 2009), protests in Tabriz and Tehran
    turned violent, and at least eight individuals were killed. State-run news
    agencies, such as Fars and Mehr, reported that banks and other public and
    private property were destroyed and burned. The Tehran Police Department
    issued a statement on the same day stating, unfortunately a limited number
    of conspirators disrupted public order through their presence in the
    streets during the religious ceremonies while chanting denigrating
    slogans. In an interview with the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation, an
    eyewitness who participated in the Ashura demonstration stated, The night
    before, we contacted friends to see who would come to the demonstration
    the next day. We did not expect that anyone would be killed on that day
    because of its religious significance. Compared to the first days after
    the election, some people were afraid
