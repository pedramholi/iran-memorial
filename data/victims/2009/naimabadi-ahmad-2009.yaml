    Mr. Na imabadi was twenty-two and back in school, following his mandatory
    military service. He enrolled in film and animation studies and kept up,
    some, with politics. Information about Mr. Ahmad Na imabadi was obtained
    from an interview with his mother on Rooz Online (June 1, 2010).
    Additional information was obtained from the Human Rights Activists in
    Iran News Agency website (July 21, 2009); the list of 72 Martyrs of the
    Green Movement by Ali Reza Beheshti (a campaign manager for the 2009
    presidential candidate Mir Hossein Musavi), which was published on the
    Norooz website on September 4, 2009; the list of the casualties of the
    post-2009 presidential election unrest posted on the Parcham website
    (October 3, 2009); and from Ms. Ma sumeh Ebtekar s blog (September 24,
    2009). Mr. Na imabadi was born on March 22, 1987. He was in his first year
    at university, studying film production and animation. He had completed
    his compulsory military service. On June 15, 2009, Mr. Na imabadi
    participated in a demonstration protesting the presidential election
    results. He was shot by the Basij forces of Ashura, Battalion 117, near
    Azadi Square in Tehran. He died in his brother s presence soon after being
    shot. He was 22 years old. On June 15, 2009, a demonstration to protest
    the result of the presidential election took place in Tehran. Several
    people were killed or injured by paramilitary forces of the Basij as the
    demonstration came to an end and people began to disperse. The Basij
    forces of Ashura, Battalion 117, opened fire on protesters from the
    rooftop and through the windows of their building located at the beginning
    of the Mohammad Ali Jenah Highway on the north side of Azadi Square. Video
    clips of these shootings, posted on YouTube, showed tens of protesters in
    front of this Basij building chanting slogans. Direct clashes between
    people and Basij forces were not seen in these clips. However, the videos
    clearly showed the Basij members shooting at people from the rooftop and
    through the windows; and gunshot noises could be heard as well as scenes
    of civilians moving injured people. During an interview with the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation, an eyewitness present at the time of
    these shootings by Basij forces stated: The crowd was so huge that a large
    demonstration took place everywhere people went. Around 7:00 p.m., I
    walked north from Azadi Square towards the Ariashahr neighborhood. The
    crowd was chanting slogans We went far away from Azadi Square. The number
    of military forces on the streets wearing multi-colored clothes gradually
    increased. Black clothed agents were also present on the streets. There
    was a limited number of police. We walked for about 800 meters or a
    kilometer when I heard a noise. People said it was the sound of shooting.
    We turned around. It was not evident where the noise came from I heard the
    sound of a machine gun shooting a round of bullets and then heard single
    shots being fired. The crowd pointed towards one place. I saw a building
    that was crowded On the rooftop, Basij members were moving about, but it
    was not very clear what was going on. I turned back and saw a young boy
    who was shot in his side and was bleeding severely. This eyewitness
    emphasized that people nearby the Basij building were not armed. The exact
    number of victims in this incident is unknown. Mr. Na imabadi s body was
    taken to the Rasul Akram Hospital. Hospital personnel stated that they had
    to deliver his body along with eight other bodies to the Ministry of
    Intelligence. Mr. Na imabadi s family located his body a week later when a
    person from the coroner s office contacted the family and asked them to
    visit the office at the Kahrizak coroner s office to identify it. At the
    Kahrizak coroner s morgue, the Na imabadi family saw a pile of
    blood-stained clothes in a corner of the room. Mr. Na imabadi s body was
    bare and his family members saw stitches on his body ( Rooz Online ). Mr.
    Na imabadi s belongings were not returned to the family. A pair of shoes
    was given to his mother, who says, We were given shoes that did not belong
    to my son The officials did not return his mobile phone, wallet, or
    clothes. I wanted to keep those things to remember him by, but we were
    even denied that. On their second visit, the family members were told that
    the clothes they had seen piled up on the ground were destroyed. Officials
    Reaction Mr. Na imabadi s family s house was under state surveillance from
    the time of his death until his body was returned to the family. According
    to Mr. Na imabadi s mother, if anyone wanted to come to our house, an
    agent would stop them and ask numerous questions. The family was not
    allowed to hold a ceremony at the burial. A memorial service was held at a
    mosque the day after the burial, but the family was given a document that
    stated that they could only say religious prayers and could not speak
    about Mr. Na imabadi. His mother says that the banners and signs put up to
    convey condolences to the family were
