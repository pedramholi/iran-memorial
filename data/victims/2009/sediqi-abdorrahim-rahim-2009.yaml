    was executed on the charge of kidnapping only on the testimony of
    witnesses. Information about the execution of Mr. Abdorrahim (Rahim)
    Sediqi, son of Abdolkarim, was obtained through Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center interviews with his brother, Abdul Nasser Sediqi, on June 22 and
    24, 2016, April 7, 2017, May 2 and 19, 2018. Mr. Sediqi was married with
    three children. He was born to an Afghan father and an Iranian mother in
    the Pahwaz camp located in Birjand County, Southern Khorasan Province. Mr.
    Sediqi was a livestock farmer in Tighab village, Faraah province in
    Afghanistan. He was very interested in sports, especially soccer. Mr.
    Sediqi died at the age of 26. According to interviewee, Mr. Sediqi had an
    Iranian birth certificate and traveled to Iran regularly to visit his aunt
    and uncle who resided in Iran. His last trip to Iran was due to the
    purchase of an apartment unit in Birjand and the legal affairs related to
    the registration of its deed. Arrest and detention According to available
    information, Mr. Sediqi arrested in Birjand County. No information is
    available on the date and manner of his arrest. During the detention, Mr.
    Sediqi only made one telephone call to his family, and his only visit to
    his mother occurred five months after his arrest and was carried out
    behind a glass divider. Mr. Sediqi s brother believes that he was tortured
    during his detention. Trial No information is available on Mr. Sediqi's
    trial. Charges Mr. Sediqi was charged with kidnapping . The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Each
    year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence According to interviewee, Mr. Sediqi was
    innocent and he was convicted only on the testimony of witnesses. One of
    the witnesses who testified against Mr. Sediqi was the person who was in
    the apartment with him for the transfer of the deed and received 150
    million Rials from Mr. Sediqi and later claimed that he was kidnapped by
    Mr. Sediqi. Because Mr. Sediqi s family were in Afghanistan, they sold
    their sheep and paid 800 million Rials to a person to hire an attorney for
    Mr. Sediqi in Iran. Not only did he fail to hire a lawyer for Mr. Sediqi,
    but he also himself testified as one of the witnesses against Mr. Sediqi.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Sediqi s defense. A Summary of
    the Legal Defects in the Adjudication of Mr. Abdorrahim Sediqi s Case
    Pursuant to Article 621 of the Islamic Penal Code, anyone who personally
    or through a third person, kidnaps or hides another for the purpose of
    demanding money or property, getting revenge, or for any other purpose, by
    force or by way of threats, trickery, or by any other means, shall be
    sentenced to five to fifteen years imprisonment In view of the provisions
    of this Article, the sentence of death issued in Mr. Sediqi s case was
    unlawful if the sole charge brought against him was kidnapping. In certain
    cases, however, it has been observed that the defendant is charged with
    other crimes such as [sexual] harassment of the victim in addition to
    kidnapping, or use of weapons in the commission of the crime of
    kidnapping; said defendant is then tried on the charge of Moharebeh (
    waging war with God ) and Efsad fel-Arz ( spreading corruption on Earth )
    and sentenced to death based on that theory. The Islamic Penal Code
    defines Moharebeh as the use of weapons for the purpose of causing
    apprehension and fear in the public. These types of crimes, that is,
    crimes that lack a specific definition and well-defined parameters
    regarding [the particular] criminal conduct, are contrary to the Principle
    of Legality and contrary to the principles of criminal law. The result of
    the existence of such [broadly defined] crimes in Iranian law is that
    Judgment Mr. Abdorrahim (Rahim) Sediqi was sentenced to death by a court
    in Birjand County. Mr. Sediqi was executed on May 10, 2009. There is no
    information available on the exact location of his execution. Several days
    after Mr. Sediqi's execution, his body was handed over to his family and
    was buried in a village called Jarg in Faraah province in Afghanistan.
