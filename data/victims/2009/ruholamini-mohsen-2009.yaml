    A student of information technology, he would later prompt the closing of
    a notorious detention center. Mohsen had questions, his father said, that
    cannot be answered through brutality. Information about Mr. Mohsen
    Ruholamini s death in detention was gathered from the following websites:
    HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on July 24, 26, and 27, 2009;
    the Association of Combatant Clerics on July 24; Khabar Online on July 26;
    Tabnak on July 29; the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on July 30; and the
    Ebtekar and Khorasan newspapers on August 5 and September 1, 2009.
    Additional information was taken from an interview with an eyewitness who
    was a cellmate of Mr. Ruholamini in the Kahrizak detention center. Mr.
    Mohsen Ruholamini was an information technology student at the School of
    Engineering of Tehran University, who was arrested in July 2009 and died
    in custody a few days later. He was the son of Dr. Abdolhossein
    Ruholamini, former head of the Pasteur Institute of Iran, Secretary
    General of the Justice and Development Party, and an advisor to Mr. Mohsen
    Reza i, a presidential candidate. Dr. Ruholamini described his son as,
    Pure, kind, and with no attachment to this world. He was always in search
    of the truth with great curiosity. He was not easily convinced, unlike
    other members of the new generation He was not satisfied with the clich
    responses that we offer our youth ( Jomhuri Eslami , July 30, 2009). The
    killing of the son of a prominent official of the Islamic Republic was
    national news and led to an open discussion among the ruling elite. After
    reports of violence and torture in the Kahrizak detention center, leading
    to the death of at least three men, were widely publicized, the Supreme
    Leader, Ayatollah Khamene i, ordered the closure of the Kahrizak detention
    center and spoke of Mr. Ruholamini s death at a gathering of university
    employees, which Mr. Ruholamini s father attended ( Khorasan , September
    1, 2009). Arrest and detention Mr. Ruholamini was arrested during a
    demonstration on July 9, 2009. He was transferred to the Kahrizak
    detention center where he was beaten and severely tortured. Mohsen s
    father explained the arrest and death of his son as follows: On July 9,
    Mohsen was arrested by plainclothes individuals and transferred to the
    headquarters of the Tehran Metropolitan Police Department located on
    Kargar Street near Enqelab Square, along with other detainees. On the
    morning of July 10, they were transferred in two buses to Evin Prison or
    the Kahrizak detention center. During an interview with the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation, an eye-witness confirmed the information above and
    described the torture of prisoners in detention as follows: [When entering
    Kahrizak], they searched us, and then we entered the courtyard. They took
    our names and made us take all our clothes off. We were all naked. They
    forced us to throw our clothes in a garbage bin. After keeping us naked
    for 30 minutes in the courtyard, they started beating us. They had thick
    hoses and batons It hurt a lot. Around 6:00 or 7:00 p.m., they took us to
    Qaran [Ward] 1. We were able to grab a piece of clothing, anything we
    could put our hands on, and put it around our waists. There were already
    people there. Some of them looked like people [who had starved in] Biafra.
    They were thin and hungry. There were so many of us. The place was [meant
    for about] 20 people, but we were about 160. So we couldn t sit down. We
    had to sleep standing up. Half of us sat, and half of us stood. We were
    not allowed to go to the toilet. Each of us passed out numerous times. It
    was very hot. There was a very small air vent, and at night the smell of
    gasoline came in. There were no windows. We banged on the door to get air,
    and instead, we had gasoline through the vent Detainees asked for water,
    but we only got one or two glasses of water a day We got a little piece of
    bread and less than a quarter of a potato, once each day. During the time
    we were in Kahrizak, they would storm in sometimes at 4:00 a.m. and push
    us into the courtyard and beat us with the hoses The third or fourth day
    [July 13th or 14th], around 12:00 p.m., they took us to the courtyard.
    They made half of us crawl on our hands and knees around the courtyard
    while carrying the other prisoners on our backs. We had to carry them in a
    circle around the courtyard. The ground was so hot, we were burning. After
    five minutes, I only saw blood on the ground from other people s knees and
    hands We circled the courtyard maybe twenty or twenty five times. If we
    stopped, they beat us. Everyone had fractured bones and injuries in
    different parts of their bodies. The environment was so dirty and hot that
    any injury got infected immediately. Everyone had infections. [The guards]
    had to use masks because of the smell In Kahrizak, several people were
    unconscious. Officials Mr. Mohsen Ruholamini s cellmate who has since left
    Iran after being released spoke about the grave condition of Mr.
    Ruholamini in prison
