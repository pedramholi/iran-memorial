    Information about Mr. Mehdi Farhadirad (Bala i) was taken from the
    websites of The Green Movement on December 28, 2009, IRNA (Islamic
    Republic News Agency) on December 27 and 29, 2009, ISNA (Iranian Students
    News Agency) on December 30, 2009, Fars news agency on December 27 and 29,
    2009, the Information Base of the Islamic Republic Security Forces on
    December 29, 2009, and RAHANA (Reporters And Human Rights Activists New
    Agency) on February 15, 2010. Mr. Farhadirad was born on July 28, 2971
    into a well-respected family in Shahr-e Ray, was killed by two bullets,
    one in his chest and the other in his head, during an attack by police and
    plain-clothed agents on December 27, 2009, the Ashura Day. Officials
    Reaction According to the existing information, on the eve of Ashura,
    officials took Mr. Farhadi s family to the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery by car
    and showed them his body being buried. They ordered the family not to have
    any ceremony. When locals put a stone with the name of Martyr Mehdi
    Farhadi on his grave, authorities objected and removed the stone few days
    later. Background Following the presidential election of June 2009 and the
    widespread protest against its result, the government tried to prevent
    demonstrations by labeling them illegal and by violently suppressing
    demonstrators. Despite the intimidating circumstances, protesters poured
    into the streets on various religious and official anniversaries Qods Day,
    Ashura, the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution (February 11) and that
    of the occupation of the U.S. Embassy (November 4) rallying and marching
    to show discontent with the regime. On the Day of Ashura (December 27,
    2009), protests in Tabriz and Tehran turned violent, with at least eight
    individuals killed. State-run news agencies, such as Fars and Mehr,
    reported that banks and other public and private property were destroyed
    and burned. The Tehran Police Department issued a statement on the same
    date stating, unfortunately a limited number of conspirators disrupted
    public order through their presence in the streets during the religious
    ceremonies while chanting digressional slogans. In an interview with
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation, an eyewitness who participated in the
    Ashura demonstration stated, On the night before, we contacted friends to
    see who would come for the demonstration the next day. We did not expect
    killing, due to the honor accorded to this day. Compared to the first days
    after the election, some people were afraid, having seen the victims and
    heard about torture in the prisons. People were more careful not to be
    arrested. At 10 a.m., we went to such streets as Hafez, Taleqani, and
    Enqelab and stayed there until 1 p.m. Most of the clashes took place on
    those three streets. Police started the violence. At one point, we were
    walking on Taleqani Street, when a police vehicle came and passed some
    protesters. We thought that they were going toward Vali asr Square, but
    [the vehicle] stopped a hundred meters ahead of us. The police officers
    got out and began shooting tear gas at people. In the past, the police
    would wait for people to become a crowd and then shoot at them, but this
    time, they did not wait, at all. Demonstrators were moving toward Vali asr
    Street, but the police began shooting immediately, to prevent the crowd
    from arriving there. However, the people were ready for violence this
    time. When police began attacking, people first fled but then started to
    throw stones at the police. The destruction was greater on the Day of
    Ashura [than on previous days]. Protesters did not damage buildings much,
    but garbage cans were set on fire in the middle of the streets. A police
    vehicle was also set on fire, which had happened before. Many people in
    the streets were religious people who were mourning, beating their chests,
    and chanting slogans against the government at the same time. Around 2 o
    clock in the afternoon, my friend s cousin informed us that a person had
    been thrown off Hafez Bridge and that shooting had been heard from Vali
    asr Square. When the number of protesters gradually diminished in the
    afternoon, the pro-government forces increased and controlled Hafez
    Street. Then, about fifty covered women appeared, chanting slogans in
    support of the government. Several video clips posted to YouTube and to
    other websites showed victims being killed. On one of these clips, a
    police vehicle was shown running over a protester several times. Names of
    at least five individuals who were run over by vehicles and died have been
    reported. High ranking police officers made confusing statements about the
    number of casualties on Ashura. They denied that police vehicles ran over
    protestors. Deputy Chief of Police confirmed, however, that 300 persons
    were arrested on that day. A Tehran Police Department statement emphasized
    that police forces will harshly counter any infringement of religious
    dignity and principles, of values of the Islamic Republic s holy regime,
    and of beliefs deeply rooted
