    The news of the execution of an unknown individual along with nine others
    was announced by the websites of the Iranian Students News Agency, ISNA,
    (March 2, 2009) and Kermanshah Post (March 2, 2009). Additional
    information regarding this execution was obtained from ISNA on February
    28, 2009. The case of this unknown individual pertains to drug
    trafficking. According to the announcement of the Public and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor of Kermanshah, this unknown individual and the nine others who
    were executed along with him had criminal records and some of them had
    been lifers who, after receiving pardon and gaining their freedom, went
    back to working for drug cartels. However, in the report of this
    execution, the specific criminal record of this unknown individual is not
    clear. Arrest and Detention There is no information available on the
    details of this unknown individual s arrest and detention. Trial According
    to the available information, this unknown individual was tried by one of
    the branches of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Kermanshah. However,
    there is no information available on the session or sessions of this
    unknown individual s trial. Charges This unknown individual and the nine
    others who were executed along with him were collectively charged with
    drug trafficking. However, the details of the charges that were brought
    against them individually are not clear. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no information available on the
    details of the evidence entered against this unknown individual. Defense
    There is no information available on the details of this unknown
    individual s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Kermanshah sentenced this unknown individual to death. According to the
    available information, the court rejected this unknown individual s
    request for appeal due to his previous criminal record. After the verdict
    had been approved by the Supreme Court, this unknown individual was hanged
    in the presence of the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Kermanshah
    Province on March 1, 2009. According to the available information, the
    head of the provincial Ministry of Justice office in Kermanshah Province,
    when announcing the news of this execution, also mentioned that some
    executions are not carried out publicly due to restrictions. There is no
    information available on the details of this verdict and the exact
    location of this execution.
