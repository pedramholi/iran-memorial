    The news of the execution of Mr. V. Ch. along with three other individuals
    was announced by the website ofKhabar-e Jonoub daily (March 5, 2009). The
    case of Mr. V. Ch., a young man from Shiraz, pertains to a murder during a
    group fight. Arrest and Detention Mr. V. Ch. was arrested in his sister s
    place by theagents of Police Station 25 in the Amirkabir Township of
    Shiraz at 1 AM on September 10, 2005. Three hours after the murder of a
    young man during a group fight in Amirkabir Township s bazaar at 10 PM on
    September 9, 2005, the police force arrested Mr. V. Ch. as the suspect and
    moved him to the Judiciary Police Station of Shiraz for investigation and
    interrogation. During the initial phase of police investigation, Mr. V.
    Ch. stated that at the night of the incident, when he was about to exit
    Amirkabir Township, a few people, including the victim, had attacked and
    beat him. However, according to his own statements during the
    interrogation sessions, he had drunk alcohol a few hours before the
    incident took place and then had gone to the bazaar in Amirkabir Township
    of Shiraz. When he arrived there, he noticed that a few people, including
    the victim, were having a fight with knives, daggers, and nunchucks. When
    he wanted to inquire about the reason for the fight, Mr. V. Ch. was
    inadvertently drawn in and received a nunchuck hit to the arm, and then
    slipped and fell to the ground. Half lying on the ground, Mr. V. Ch. took
    up a knife and escaped while his clothes were soaked with blood and the
    victim was staggering backwards. The victim was wounded due to the
    stabbing, and died of his severe wounds soon after he had been moved to
    hospital. Mr. V. Ch. spent four years in prison. Trial Mr. V. Ch. was
    tried by Branch Five of the Public Court of Fars Province. The court
    proceedings were held in the presence of the representative of the public
    prosecutor, the first-degree blood relatives of the victim, and Mr. V. Ch.
    s lawyers. Both the representative of the public prosecutor and the
    first-degree blood relatives of the victim asked the court for an
    execution verdict. Charges The court charged Mr. V. Ch. with murder. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of Guilt The court issued its verdict on the basis of Mr. V. Ch.
    s confessions during the different stages of investigation and
    interrogation. However, no information is available on the details of the
    evidence that was brought against him. The corpse of the victim was among
    the pieces of evidence entered against Mr. V. Ch. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    During the court proceedings, Mr. V. Ch. defended himself by saying that
    he had not gone to the bazaar to get involved in a fight. He claimed that
    he only defended himself after the victim had hit him with nunchucks. He
    appealed for amnesty during the trial. In addition, his defense lawyers
    stated that because Mr. V. Ch. had only intended to defend himself during
    the fight, he could not be held responsible for the murder of the victim.
    According to the published report, during the initial phase of court
    investigation, one of the residents of Amirkabir Township had testified
    that immediately before the fight he had heard the victim along with a few
    others say that they were going to teach [someone] a lesson. However, the
    witness had also added that he did not know who actually started the
    fight. Judgment Branch Five of the Public Court of Fars Province, at the
    request of the first-degree blood relatives of the victim, sentenced Mr.
    V. Ch. to death. Branch 42 of the Supreme Court overturned the ruling of
    the initial court and referred Mr. V. Ch. s case back to that court for
    reassessment. Branch Five tried him again and for a second time ruled for
    his execution. This time Branch 42 approved the verdict. Mr. V. Ch. was
    hanged in Adelabad Prison in Shiraz on the morning of March 4, 2009.
