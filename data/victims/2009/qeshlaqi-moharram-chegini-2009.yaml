    He had aspirations, which he shared with his wife: a peaceful life, to
    travel, to become parents. With the number of victims rising, his mother
    wondered why the world community was so quiet. Information about the death
    of Mr. Moharram Chegini Qeshlaqi was collected from reports of the Where
    Are Our Votes website (January 13, 2010; February 4, 2010; May 19, 2010)
    as well as Rooz Online (June 14, 2010), where interviews with Mr. Chegini
    Qeshlaqi s brother, mother, and wife are posted. His name is also
    mentioned as a casualty of post-election protests on the lists posted on
    the Iran News Agency s site (June 28, 2009), the Human Rights Activists in
    Iran website (July 21, 2009), and the Parcham website (October 3, 2009).
    The Behesht-e Zahra cemetery s site states that he is buried there. Mr.
    Chegini Qeshlaqi, son of Mirza Qoli, was born on October 2, 1975.
    According to his wife, he had many dreams. The couple wanted to have a
    child, travel, and lead a peaceful life. On June 15, 2009, Mr. Chegini
    Qeshlaqi participated in a demonstration to protest the result of the
    presidential election. Around 7 or 8 in the evening, he was shot in the
    head and killed in front of Meqdad Base of the Basij s Ashura 117
    Battalion, near the Azadi Square. That day, someone called his wife from
    the Rasul Akram Hospital and said that he was shot in the leg. When his
    family members went to the hospital, they could not find any information
    about Mr. Chegini Qeshlaqi; however, they found out that at least eight
    individuals were killed that day. Family members also visited other
    hospitals in Tehran, but did not find any other information about him. On
    June 15, 2009, a demonstration to protest the result of the presidential
    election took place in Tehran. Several people were killed or injured by
    paramilitary forces of the Basij as the demonstration came to an end and
    people began to disperse. The Basij forces of Ashura, Battalion 117,
    opened fire on protesters from the rooftop and through the windows of
    their building located at the beginning of the Mohammad Ali Jenah Highway
    on the north side of Azadi Square. Video clips of these shootings, posted
    on YouTube, showed tens of protesters in front of this Basij building
    chanting slogans. Direct clashes between people and Basij forces were not
    seen in these clips. However, the videos clearly showed the Basij members
    shooting at people from the rooftop and through the windows; and gunshot
    noises could be heard as well as scenes of civilians moving injured
    people. During an interview with the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation, an
    eyewitness present at the time of these shootings by Basij forces stated:
    The crowd was so huge that a large demonstration took place everywhere
    people went. Around 7:00 p.m., I walked north from Azadi Square towards
    the Ariashahr neighborhood. The crowd was chanting slogans We went far
    away from Azadi Square. The number of military forces on the streets
    wearing multi-colored clothes gradually increased. Black clothed agents
    were also present on the streets. There was a limited number of police. We
    walked for about 800 meters or a kilometer when I heard a noise. People
    said it was the sound of shooting. We turned around. It was not evident
    where the noise came from I heard the sound of a machine gun shooting a
    round of bullets and then heard single shots being fired. The crowd
    pointed towards one place. I saw a building that was crowded On the
    rooftop, Basij members were moving about, but it was not very clear what
    was going on. I turned back and saw a young boy who was shot in his side
    and was bleeding severely. This eyewitness emphasized that people nearby
    the Basij building were not armed. The exact number of victims in this
    incident is unknown. On June 17, family members saw video footage of Mr.
    Chegini Qeshlaqi being shot and killed. The Where Are Our Votes website
    reported that the video of Moharram being shot clearly shows that the
    bullet was shot from the direction of the Basij Base. Mr. Chegini Qeshlaqi
    s bag was found at the location where he was shot in central Tehran and
    returned to his family. On June 22, someone called Mr. Chegini Qeshlaqi s
    brother from the Kahrizak coroner and asked them to visit the coroner s
    office. There, family members identified Mr. Chegini Qeshlaqi s pictures
    among photographs of the casualties of post-election protests. The
    officials told them to go to the Detective Police station in Shahriar (a
    city in the suburbs of Tehran). The police told the family that Mr.
    Chegini Qeshlaqi s body was found at 6 a.m. on June 16 on a street in
    District Four of the Andisheh neighborhood in Shahriar. His brother
    stated: His body and three other bodies were abandoned in Shahriar ( Where
    Are Our Votes , February 4, 2010). The authorities returned to the family
    only on the condition that they would not publicize his death ( Rooz
    Online ). Mr. Chegini Qeshlaqi was buried at the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery,
    in Tehran. Officials Reaction According to Mr. Che
