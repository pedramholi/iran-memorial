    Ashkan Sohrabi, a 20-year-old from Tehran, was killed by security forces
    during one of the most violent days of the 2009 protests. Information
    regarding the arbitrary execution of Mr. Ashkan Sohrabi, son of Gholamreza
    and Ms. Zahra Nik Peyma, was obtained from Rooz Online (October 22, 2009;
    March 3, 2010), BBC Persian (July 26, 2009), HRANA (December 17, 2010),
    Iran-Dokht (July 23, 2009), Radio Farda (December 23, 2013), the Agh
    Bahman blog (September 17, 2009), the Ashkan Sohrabi Memorial Facebook
    page (January 31, 2014), Tehran Report (October 3, 2010), and the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center archives (March 6, 2012). Mr. Ashkan Sohrabi
    was born on January 30, 1990, in Tehran, where he grew up with his family
    in the Salsabil neighborhood. He was the second child in a family with two
    sisters. The Sohrabi family belonged to the religious, culturally inclined
    middle class. Mr. Sohrabi s father volunteered as a Basij member at the
    front during the Iran Iraq War. His uncle was a war veteran who was
    injured, and his cousin was killed during the same conflict. His mother
    worked at Tarbiat Modares University in Tehran. (Rooz Online, July 2009).
    Mr. Sohrabi studied IT engineering at Qazvin Islamic Azad University.
    Friends and family described him as a polite, intelligent, and highly
    motivated young man with a cheerful, good-humored personality who was
    serious about his studies. His family said he was his mother s "closest
    companion" and always sought to make others happy. (Ebtekar-e Sabz; Radio
    Farda, December 23, 2013). From a young age, Mr. Sohrabi was passionate
    about art and sports. He was a professional taekwondo athlete, held a
    second-degree black belt, and won many championship titles. Mr. Sohrabi
    also enjoyed painting and was a dedicated supporter of the Persepolis
    football team. He was especially a big fan of Ali Karimi, the team s
    captain at the time. After Ashkan was killed, Karimi donated the jersey he
    wore during the European Club Champions League to the Sohrabi family. (BBC
    Persian, July 26, 2009; Radio Farda, December 23, 2013). 2009 Election -
    Background Election returns from Iran s June 12th, 2009, presidential
    election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63 percent of the
    vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing these official
    results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging services were
    disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the election and
    remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st. On Election
    Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any gathering
    of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country. The same
    evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing their
    presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
    reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protesters took part in
    peaceful demonstrations in Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on
    June 19th after Ayatollah Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced
    his support for Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were
    responsible for any disorder and its consequences. Amnesty International
    stated that the speech gave legitimacy to police brutality. The next day
    and thereafter, police and plainclothes paramilitary groups attacked the
    protesters. Public gatherings of any kind were declared illegal, and
    police, motorcycle-riding special units wearing black uniforms and
    helmets, and plainclothes agents brutally enforced this
