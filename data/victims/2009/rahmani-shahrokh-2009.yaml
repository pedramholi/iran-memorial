    What the authorities wanted from Mr. Rahmani s family was to declare them,
    the police, harmless, after their vehicles spent part of the Day of Ashura
    driving over people. Information about Mr. Shahrokh Rahmani, son of Hamzeh
    and born on August 16, 1984, was gathered from the following sources: the
    Islamic Republic News Agency (December 27 and 29, 2009), the Islamic
    Students News Agency (December 30, 2009), the Fars News Agency (December
    27 and 30, 2009), the Police News Center (December 29, 2009), the Rahe
    Sabz website (December 31, 2009), the website of the Behesht-e Zahra
    cemetery in Tehran, as well as the video clip of the Voice of America
    interview with Mr. Rahmani s brother (January 6, 2010), which was posted
    to YouTube. On Sunday, December 27, 2009, Mr. Rahmani was run over and
    killed by a police vehicle near the Azadi Square in Tehran. The police
    called Mr. Rahmani s brother and informed him of his brother s death. The
    police asked his brother to visit the coroner s office to identify the
    body. On December 28, Mr. Rahmani s brother went to the Kahrizak coroner s
    office. Mr. Rahmani s body was returned to his family on the condition
    that they would not speak publicly about him. The death certificate stated
    that the cause of death was to be determined. The police threatened the
    Rahmani family and stated that they should proclaim that Mr. Rahmani died
    in a regular car accident [not related to the police]. The memorial
    ceremony for Mr. Rahmani took place at the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery on
    December 30, 2009. Shahrokh Rahmani was 24. Background Following the
    presidential election of June 2009 and the widespread protests against its
    result, the government tried to prevent demonstrations by labeling them
    illegal and by violently suppressing demonstrators. Despite the
    intimidating circumstances, protesters poured into the streets on various
    religious and official anniversaries Qods Day, Ashura Day, the anniversary
    of the Iranian Revolution (February 11), and that of the occupation of the
    U.S. Embassy (November 14) rallying and marching to show discontent with
    the regime. On the Day of Ashura (December 27, 2009), protests in Tabriz
    and Tehran turned violent, and at least eight individuals were killed.
    State-run news agencies, such as Fars and Mehr, reported that banks and
    other public and private property were destroyed and burned. The Tehran
    Police Department issued a statement on the same day stating,
    unfortunately a limited number of conspirators disrupted public order
    through their presence in the streets during the religious ceremonies
    while chanting denigrating slogans. In an interview with the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation, an eyewitness who participated in the Ashura
    demonstration stated, The night before, we contacted friends to see who
    would come to the demonstration the next day. We did not expect that
    anyone would be killed on that day because of its religious significance.
    Compared to the first days after the election, some people were afraid [on
    Ashura Day], having seen the victims and heard about torture in the
    prisons. People were more careful not to be arrested. At 10 a.m., we went
    to the streets, such as Hafez, Taleqani, and Enqelab streets, and stayed
    there until 1 p.m. Most of the clashes took place on these three streets.
    Police started the violence. At one point, we were walking along Taleqani
    Street, when a police vehicle passed by some protesters. We thought that
    they were going toward Vali asr Square, but [the vehicle] stopped a
    hundred meters ahead of us. The police officers got out of the car and
    began shooting tear gas at people. In the past, the police would wait for
    people to form a crowd before shooting at them, but this time the police
    did not wait at all. Demonstrators were moving toward Vali asr Street, but
    the police began shooting [tear gas] to prevent the crowd from reaching
    [Vali asr Street]. However, people were prepared for violence this time.
    When the police began attacking, people at first fled but then started to
    throw stones at the police. The destruction on the Day of Ashura was
    greater [than during previous days]. Protesters did not damage buildings
    much, but garbage cans were set on fire in the middle of the streets. A
    police vehicle was also set on fire, which had happened before. Many
    people in the streets were religious people who were mourning, beating
    their chests, and chanting slogans against the government at the same
    time. Around 2 o clock in the afternoon, my friend s cousin informed us
    that a person had been thrown off the Hafez Bridge and that people heard
    the sound of shooting around Vali asr Square. In the afternoon, when the
    number of protesters gradually diminished, the pro-government forces
    increased and controlled Hafez Street. Then, about fifty veiled women
    appeared and chanted slogans in support of the government. Several video
    clips posted on YouTube and to other websites showed victims being killed.
    In one of these clips, a police vehicle i
