    Mr. Tahmasbi was beaten by armed agents in Kermanshah, just days after
    election ballots were totaled. His family had ideas for the service for
    their son, but most were rejected. News of the killing of Mr. Hossein
    Tahmasbi was published on the websites of Association of Political
    Prisoners in Exile, quoting the Human Rights Activists in Iran on July 5,
    2009 and Ensaniat, quoting Human Rights Watch in Kurdestan on July 19,
    2009. Mr. Hossein Tahmasbi s name appeared on the list published by the
    Human Rights Activists in Iran containing victims information from June 12
    to July 3, 2009. According to this list, Hossein Tahmasbi, 25, was
    attacked by official armed agents in Nobahar Street in Kermanshah on June
    15, 2009. He died due to blows that he received. According to the Human
    Rights Watch in Kurdestan, authorities restricted Mr. Tahmasbi s family
    during the mourning ceremony that took place in Imam-Hossein Saloon at
    Shirokhorshid intersection in Kermanshah and did not permit them to
    distribute their announcement across the city, using the word of martyr in
    it. Also, at the end of the ceremony, the family was pressured by security
    forces to repeatedly demand that hundreds of protesters, who gathered in
    front of the Saloon and cried Allah-o-Akbar [God is great], end their
    gathering and leave. Background Election returns from Iran s June 12th,
    2009, presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with
    62.63 percent of the vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing
    these official results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging
    services were disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the
    election and remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st.
    On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any
    gathering of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country.
    The same evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing
    their presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
    reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protesters took part in
    peaceful demonstrations in Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on
    June 19th after Ayatollah Khamenei s Friday sermon. The speech was
    understood by many, including Amnesty International, as giving legitimacy
    to police brutality. The next day and thereafter, police and plainclothes
    paramilitary groups attacked the protesters. Public gatherings of any kind
    were declared illegal, and police, motorcycle-riding special units wearing
    black uniforms and helmets, and plainclothes agents brutally enforced this
    restriction. Individuals in civilian clothing, commonly referred to as
    plainclothes forces, are used in the Islamic Republic to disrupt political
    and trade union activities, student events and gatherings, electoral
    initiatives, and protests. Armed with sticks and clubs, and sometimes with
    chains, knives, batons, or firearms, they emerge when the state decides to
    suppress dissent. These plainclothes forces move about freely, violently
    beating protesters and arresting them, while the police passively look on
    or actively cooperate with them. There is little information on the
    command structure and organization of such groups, whose members wear
    ordinary clothing rather than official uniforms and may be affiliated with
    the ministry of information, influential political groups, or the armed
    forces. Following the post-election demonstrations in June 2009, pictures
