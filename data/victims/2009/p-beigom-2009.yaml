    The news of Ms. Beigom P. s execution, along with two other persons, was
    published by Keyhan newspaper (November 18, 2009) and Nesfe Jahan
    newspaper (November 19, 2009). According to available information, Ms.
    Beigom P. s case was related to drug offences. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Ms. Beigom P. s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    The Revolutionary Court of Isfahan tried Ms. Beigom P. No information is
    available on her trial. Charges Ms. Beigom P. was charged with addiction
    and participating in drug transport . She was accused of transporting 500
    grams of crack cocaine to Isfahan after swallowing them. There is no
    detailed information about her charges. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against Ms. Beigom P. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Defense No
    information is available on Ms. Beigom P. s defense. Judgment Isfahan
    Revolutionary Court sentenced Ms. Beigom P. to execution. According to
    available information, Ms. Beigom P. had twice requested pardon and
    mitigation of her punishment from execution to life in prison, but her
    requests were rejected by the Amnesty and Forgiveness Commission of
    Isfahan province (Nesfe Jahan newspaper, November 19, 2009). Her sentence
    was upheld by the Supreme Court. On Monday morning, November 16, 2009, Ms.
    Beigom P. was hanged in Isfahan Central Prison.
