    Zabihollah Narue ei was tried and sentenced to death in a mass trial that
    took only 30 hours. What did judicial officials pursue: justice or
    revenge? News of the execution of Mr. Zabihollah Naru i, child of Rassul,
    and two other defendants in the case, was published by numerous sources
    including Sistan and Baluchestan Province Judiciary s website (June 1,
    2009); Islamic Republic of Iran Police Force news website (May 30, 2009);
    Iranian Students News Organization (ISNA), Fars News Agency, and Taftan
    News Agency (June 1, 2009). Additional information about this case was
    obtained from Iran newspaper, Jam-e Jam online, and Radio Farda (May 30,
    2009), and from other sources. * Mr. Naru i was a member of the cultural
    wing of the Iran Popular Resistance Movement (Jondollah)**, and was active
    in the distribution of CDs, film, announcements, and flyers for the
    Movement (Taftan News Agency, May 29, 2009). Based on available
    information, Mr. Naru i s case was related to an explosion at the Imam Ali
    Mosque*** in the city of Zahedan on May 28, 2009. Arrest and detention
    Information Administration agents arrested Mr. Naru i at Zahedan s Imam
    Ali Mosque on May 26, 2009 (BBC Persian and Jam-e Jam online, June 1,
    2009, and Donyaye Eghtessad newspaper, May 31, 2009). No information is
    available about the details of his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Naru i
    and his co-defendants were tried between the night of Thursday, May 28,
    and the morning of Saturday, May 30, 2009. The trial took place in the
    presence of his court-appointed attorney and the session was videotaped
    (ISNA, May 30, 2009). No information is available about the details of the
    trial session/s. Charges Mr. Naru i s trial was a mass trial with the
    other defendants in the case in which they were charged with complicity in
    the bombing of Zahedan s Imam Ali Mosque, complicity in the bombing of the
    Sarallah bus in 2006-07, complicity in the bombing of University Boulevard
    in 2006-07, attempted unsuccessful bombing of the February 10, 2009
    demonstrations, explosion of a bomb in Zahedan s Alghadir Mosque in
    February 2009, complicity in the March 2009 operations in the Lar region,
    complicity in four counts of armed hostage-taking for purposes of
    extortion on behalf of the Rigi gang, planning eight counts of
    unsuccessful terrorist and hostage-taking operations, and procuring a team
    house in Zahedan to carry out various operations (Sistan and Baluchestan
    Province Judiciary, June 1, 2009). No information is available about
    charges brought individually against Mr. Naru i. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations cite reports according to which, in certain cases,
    officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran bring false charges against
    their opponents (including political, civil, and union activists, as well
    as ethnic and religious minorities) such as drug trafficking or commission
    of public or sexual crimes, and execute them along with other regular
    criminals. Hundreds of people are sentenced to death in Iran every year;
    however, the number of those who are sentenced to death based on these
    false charges is not known. Evidence of guilt Mr. Naru i s confession was
    the basis of his conviction and sentence (Iran-e Asr, May 30, 2009). The
    security forces investigations and reports were also among evidence
    presented against him. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Naru i had been arrested
    two days prior to the bombing. Furthermore, based on published reports,
    the perpetrator of the bombing was killed in the explosion (Iran
    newspaper, May 30, 2009). Following the bombing, the Baluchestan Popular
    Movement (Jondollah) issued a statement claiming responsibility and stated
    that Mr. Naru i had only cooperated with Jondollah in cultural areas such
    as distributing CDs, film, announcements, and flyers, and had played no
    role in the Imam Ali Mosque bombing (Taftan, May 30, 2009). Mr. Naru i s
    case was adjudicated within 30 hours after the explosion and his trial
    took place outside the normal and legal framework of adjudication
    procedures. He was denied an attorney of his choosing and was not given
    sufficient time to prepare a defense. No information is available on Mr.
    Naru i s defense at trial. A Summary of the Defects of Mr.Naru i s Legal
    Proceedings It can be said with utmost certainty that Mr. Naru i s is a
    flagrant case of disregard for the principles of fair trial. The defendant
    in the case was arrested on May 26, 2009. The bombing occurred on May 28,
    and the defendants were executed on May 30. The judicial authorities
    charged the defendants with complicity in the bombing of Zahe
