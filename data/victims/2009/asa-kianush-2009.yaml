    Mr. Asa was shot during the post-presidential election protests in Iran on
    June 15, 2009. He was born into a Kurdish family from the Sanjabi tribe in
    Kermanshah. The members of this tribe are mostly "Ahl-e Haq religion or
    Yarsan (1) (Committee of Human Rights Reporters, 21 March 2010). Mr Asa
    graduated from the Razi University of Kermanshah in chemical engineering
    with a concentration in gas and petro chemistry and was enrolled in a
    masters program at the Elm-o San at University of Tehran. He was planning
    to finish his thesis during the summer of 2009. He left Kermanshah for
    Tehran before the election day and told his family that his trip to Tehran
    was necessary to take care of some administrative issues related to his
    thesis (ABF interview). Mr. Asa was known as a responsible and intelligent
    person who particularly valued education. He had found a job to suport his
    family financially after his graduation in order to make it possible for
    his older brother who had to leave school after their father s death to go
    back to school. He also was an active member of civil society, especially
    focused on environmental activism. He was a member of many groups and
    clubs such as the Technical School of Razi University, Kurd Youth, Youth
    of Kermanshah and Shajarian. He was also a member of the Association of
    the Green Front and participated in its activities, such as cleaning up
    trash from the mountains (ABF interview with one of Mr. Asa s relatives).
    Mr. Asa did not belong to any political party, yet, according to the
    interviewee, he did not believe in apathy. He was interested in political
    and social issues and brought the university publications home and
    encouraged others to read them. Before the presidential election of 2009,
    he was a member of Mehdi Karoubi s campaign. He used to discuss his
    support for Mr. Karoubi openly at his university (ABF interview). Mr. Asa
    also liked reading books, especially history books. He was interested in
    drawing. He used to play the tanbour, a traditional Iranian music
    instrument (Roozonline, 28 May 2009; ABF interview with one of Mr. Asa
    relatives). Death Mr. Asa was shot on 15 June 2009, during massive
    demonstrations related to the Green Movement, but the exact date of his
    death remains unclear, the reasons for which are described below.
    According to one his relatives, Mr. Asa left his dormitory at around 2:00
    or 3:00 P.M. on 15 June in order to attend a rally in favor of the Green
    Movement. He also brought along several students. On Azadi Street in
    Tehran, 2 or 3 kilometers from Azadi Square, his friends left him one by
    one despite Mr. Asa s insistance on continuing to the rally. Based on the
    available information, Mr. Asa heard the leaders of the Green Movement,
    walked towards the sounds and left his friend. That was the last time his
    friend saw him alive (ABF interview). According to the interviewee,
    eye-witnesses said that he was shot once in the side. He was moving his
    hands, legs and neck and even turned his head. Other protesters picked him
    up and put him in a car (ABF interview). On the morning of 17 June 2009,
    after several unsuccessful calls to his cell phone, Mr. Asa s brother and
    sister went from Kermanshah to Tehran to find him. At first they went to
    the Rasul Akram Hospital, where some of the wounded protesters of 17 June
    but they were not allowed to enter the hospital. They were shown a list of
    wounded, but Mr. Asa s name was not among them. They were told that the
    security forces took most of the wounded and all the dead from the
    hostpital two days prior. They also went to Evin Prison every day and to
    Kahrizak Center without success. In the following days, they searched for
    Kianoosh unsuccessfully. They went to the Revolutionary Tribunal, the
    Shapour Police Station, the NAJA Intelligence Service, the Security Police
    and other places where they guessed Mr. Asa might be (ABF interview).
    Finally, on Wednesday 25 June, they went to the Forensic Office and found
    their brother s picture among photographs of people who had been killed
    but remained unidentified (ABF interview). On Mr. Asa had been shot twice.
    Once in his side as reported by eye witnesses and once in the neck (ABF
    interview and Committee of Human Rights Reporters, 19 August 2009). The
