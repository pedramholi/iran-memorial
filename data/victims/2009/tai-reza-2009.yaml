    The information about Mr. Reza Ta i, son of Aziz, has been drawn from an
    article by Mr. Hamed Knani, published on the Akhbar Rooz website on
    November 19, 2009. Iran News Agency reported this event on November 16,
    2009, but referred to the victim as Reza Mahavandi. Mr. Ta i resided in
    Ahvaz. He was a 22 year old university student. According to information
    available, on November 13, 2009, Mr. Ta i was driving his car on a highway
    in Ahvaz when he reached a checkpoint. He stopped the car and got out. A
    police officer shot him from close range and killed him. Iran News Agency
    reported that after the shooting, security agents patrolled the
    neighborhood where Mr. Ta i lived, in order to prevent provocation of
    people s feelings and politicizing his death. The reason for the shooting
    is not known. Mr. Knani only refers to a broadcasting company s interview
    with Mr. Ta i s father. A few months prior to Mr. Ta i s death, an
    interview with his father was televised in a program covering the unrest
    following the contested presidential election of 2009. The interview took
    place in an underprivileged neighborhood in Ahvaz. Mr. Ta i s father was
    wearing clothing traditional of the Arab minority. The interviewer asked,
    what is your message for the authorities? The old man said, I ask the
    government of the Islamic Republic to reflect on our youth, [and the]
    disadvantaged [status] and unemployment in the Arab community. I ask them
    to look after our children. Background Election returns from Iran s June
    12th, 2009, presidential election declared Mahmud Ahmadinejad to have been
    re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote. Following the announcement,
    citizens disputing these official results demonstrated in the streets.
    Text messaging services had been disrupted since 11:00 p.m. on the night
    before the election and remained unavailable until July 1st. On Election
    Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any gathering
    of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country. On the same
    evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing their
    presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. At election headquarters, the head official began reporting
    results soon after midnight, despite a statement from the Interior
    Minister that the first returns would not be announced until after the
    morning prayer (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential
    candidates came out into the streets on June 13th, once the results had
    been made public, to protest what they believed to be a fraudulent
    election. Candidates Musavi, Karubi, and Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians [the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards], requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people who had been active in
    Karubi s and Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations were held on the streets of central Tehran, in which an
    estimated three million protestors participated, according to statements
    attributed to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending,
    paramilitary forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several
    people. To prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government
    expelled foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies
    from reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protesters took
    part in peaceful demonstrations in Tehran. After Ayatollah Khamenei s
    Friday sermon on June 19th, which Amnesty International said gave
    legitimacy to police brutality, the repression entered a new phase. The
    next day and thereafter, police and plainclothes paramilitary groups
    confronted the protesters, resulting in casualties. Public gatherings of
    any kind were declared illegal, and police and plainclothes agents
    brutally enforced this restriction. Paramilitary plainclothes groups are
    used in Iran to disrupt political and trade union activities, student
    events and gatherings, electoral initiatives, and protests. There is
    little information on the command structure and organization of such
    groups, whose members wear ordinary clothing rather than official
    uniforms. Armed with sticks and clubs, and sometimes with chains, knives,
    batons, or firearms, they emerge when the state decides to suppress
    dissent. Police forces either passively observe their conduct and do not
    react, or they may actively cooperate with the plainclothes forces, who
    move freely about, violently beating protesters, including when the police
    are present. Following the post-election demonstrations of June 2009,
    pictures of some plainclothes agents were posted on internet websi
