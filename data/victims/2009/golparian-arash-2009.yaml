    The news of the execution of Mr. Arash Golparian along with the three
    other defendants in this case was announced by the websites of Iran Human
    Rights (April 28, 2009) and Kurdistan Media (January 27, 2009). Additional
    information regarding this case was obtained from the interview conducted
    by Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with a former fellow inmate of the
    executed individual. Mr. Golparian was from Hamadan. According to the
    available information, his case pertains to abduction and rape (Kurdistan
    Media, January 27, 2009). Arrest and Detention There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Golparian s arrest and detention. He spent
    five years in prison (Kurdistan Media, January 27, 2009). An eyewitness
    who was in detention in Sanandaj Prison in the second half of 2007
    testified to Mr. Golparian s presence in the prison as an inmate during
    that time. According to this eyewitness, Mr. Golparian used to work in the
    prison infirmary while in detention there (ABC interview). Trial There is
    no information available on the session or sessions of Mr. Golparian s
    trial. Charges According to the available information, Mr. Golparian was
    charged with abduction and rape (Kurdistan Media, January 27, 2009).
    According to the statements of an individual who used to be in detention
    in Sanandaj Prison at the same time, Mr. Golparian and the three other
    individuals incriminated in this case had been charged with raping a
    female student in the city of Hamadan (ABC interview). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence entered against Mr. Golparian. Defense There
    is no information available on the details of Mr. Golparian s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Arash Golparian was hanged along with the three other
    defendants in this case in Sanandaj Central Prison some time during the
    winter of 2009 (Iran Human Rights, April 28, 2009; Kurdistan Media,
    January 27, 2009). However, there is no information available on the exact
    date of this execution.
