    "A pious, humble, cheerful, warm-hearted, modest, kind, and moral young
    man - one whom all his friends described as truly admirable." Information
    regarding the arbitrary execution of Mostafa Ghanian, the son of Mohammad
    Taqi, was obtained from HRANA (June 19, 2009) and from an electronic form
    submitted to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center by one of his close
    acquaintances (June 11, 2010). Additional information was gathered from
    the websites of the Committee of Human Rights Reporters (June 21, 2009),
    IRNA (July 1, 2009), Iran newspaper (August 9, 2009), Association of
    Iranian Political Prisoners (August 11, 2009), Sarmayeh (August 31, 2009),
    Iran-e Sabz (April 19, 2010), Daneshjoo News (June 15, 2010), Jaras (June
    19, 2010), Norooz (June 20, 2010), and Radio Farda (January 24, 2014). Mr.
    Ghanian was born in Mashhad on June 24, 1983. He was single and a
    university student. He earned an associate degree from Islamic Azad
    University in Birjand and was pursuing a bachelor's degree in agriculture
    at Azad University, Roudehen Branch. He lived in an apartment in
    Saadatabad, Tehran. According to a friend, despite his family's wealth,
    Mostafa was modest and down-to-earth, always present among friends and
    never drawing social distinctions between people. He loved music -
    especially the classics of Shamaeezadeh and Hayedeh - as well as rap. He
    subscribed to Mashin magazine and had a special passion for classic
    American cars. He also served as a judge for the Automobile and Motorcycle
    Federation. (Electronic form, June 11, 2010) According to his close
    friend, Mostafa was extremely polite and conscientious in social
    situations. If he sensed that someone was upset with him, he would go out
    of his way to make amends. He was known to be shy and overly considerate -
    he never liked to impose on anyone. His home in Tehran became a meeting
    place and shelter for friends. When his friends from Mashhad came to
    visit, he would drop everything to welcome and care for them. His friend
    said, "I have never found a friend like Mostafa in my life." (Electronic
    Form, June 11, 2010) His father, Mohammad Taqi Ghanian, described him as
    "a pious, humble, cheerful, warm-hearted, modest, kind and moral young man
    - someone whom all his friends described as truly admirable. He added that
    although Mostafa was unhappy with the state of the country and well aware
    of the injustices perpetrated by the authorities, he never participated in
    political activities. (Radio Farda, January 24, 2014) Mr. Ghanian
    disagreed with the outcome of the 2009 presidential election and believed
    it was rigged. He learned through social media that a nightly campaign of
    chanting "Allahu Akbar" from rooftops had begun in protest, so he decided
    to join. (Radio Farda, January 24, 2014) 2009 Election - Background
    Election returns from Iran s June 12 th , 2009, presidential election
    declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote.
    Following the announcement, citizens disputing these official results
    demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging services were disrupted
    starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the election and remained
    unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st. On Election Day, the
    deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any gathering of
    presidential candidates supporters throughout the country. The same
    evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing their
    presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
