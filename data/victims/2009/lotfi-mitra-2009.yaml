    Ms. Lotfi pursued her studies close to the Straits of Hormuz. She and
    others from Bandar Abbas Azad University faced a security crackdown, which
    led to a disappearance. News of the killing of Ms. Mitra Lotfi was
    published by various media including websites of Payam on June 26, 2009,
    and the Kordistan Democratic Party of Iran on June 22, 2009. According to
    the Payam website, Ms. Lotfi was severely injured, as security forces
    brutally attacked the students of Bandar Abbas Azad University, who
    demonstrated against the presidential election results. She died. The
    Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran website confirmed that a female
    student, who was beaten and disappeared in front of Bandar Abbas Azad
    University, had died during the attack. According to this source, In order
    to block the news and avoid the reaction of angry protesters, suppressive
    agents and officials took the body of this victim and did not inform her
    family about her death. Background Election returns from Iran s June 12th,
    2009, presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with
    62.63 percent of the vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing
    these official results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging
    services were disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the
    election and remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st.
    On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any
    gathering of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country.
    The same evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing
    their presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
    reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protesters took part in
    peaceful demonstrations in Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on
    June 19thafter Ayatollah Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced
    his support for Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were
    responsible for any disorder and its consequences. Amnesty International
    stated that the speech gave legitimacy to police brutality. The next day
    and thereafter, police and plainclothes paramilitary groups attacked the
    protesters. Public gatherings of any kind were declared illegal, and
    police, motorcycle-riding special units wearing black uniforms and
    helmets, and plainclothes agents brutally enforced this restriction.
    Individuals in civilian clothing, commonly referred to as plainclothes
    forces, are used in the Islamic Republic to disrupt political and trade
    union activities, student events and gatherings, electoral initiatives,
    and protests. Armed with sticks and clubs, and sometimes with chains,
    knives, batons, or firearms, they emerge when the state decides to
    suppress dissent. These plainclothes forces move about freely, violently
    beating protesters and arresting them, while the police passively look on
    or actively cooperate with them. There is little information on the
    command structure and organization of such groups, whose members wear
    ordinary clothing rather than official uniforms and may be affiliated with
    the ministry of information, influential political groups, or the armed
    forces. Following the post-election demonstrations in June 2009, pictures
    of some plainclothes agents were posted on internet websites. Internet
    users helped to identify some of them and provided evidence that these
    individuals were affiliated with the Basij paramilitary groups, the
    Revolutionary Guard Corps, and state intelligence forces
