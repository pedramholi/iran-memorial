    Ramin Ramezani was on medical leave from military service when he joined
    the protests and lost his life. Information regarding the arbitrary
    execution of Mr. Ramin Ramezani, son of Mehdi and Zahra, was gathered from
    Iran Khabar Agency (June 28, 2009), Ebtekare Sabz (August 11, 2009), Rooz
    Online (April 6, September 26, November 27, 2010, and January 11, 2011),
    Association in Support of the Families of Victims (January 31, February 1,
    and March 18, 2010), Iran Press News (January 28, 2010), Agh Bahman blog
    (January 11, 2010), Where Is My Vote (March 27 and 30, 2010), Green Path
    of Hope (November 28, 2010), and Reporters Without Borders (March 17,
    2013). Ramin Ramezani was born on June 21, 1987 in Tehran. He finished
    secondary school with a focus on computer studies and, after receiving his
    diploma, worked for a time in a computer-hardware shop. He was an artist
    who painted, even as he prepared for compulsory military service. Although
    he was reluctant to serve, he decided to do so on his family s advice to
    keep better job opportunities open. He completed Air Force basic training
    at a Semnan garrison and was then posted to Zahedan. There, he served for
    nearly seven months near the Zabol border as a second sergeant in air
    defense unit. (Association in Support of Families of the Dead and
    Detainees, February 2, 2010, and June 22, 2010; Masoumeh Ebtekar s blog,
    August 11, 2009) His family remembers him as calm, composed, and
    responsible. His father said, If he weighed fifty kilos, he had fifty
    kilos of courage. Of all my children, Ramin was different principled and
    full of passion, someone who couldn t remain indifferent to what was
    happening in society. (Where Is My Vote, March 27, 2010; Association in
    Support of Families of the Dead and Detainees, June 22, 2010; Rooz Online,
    April 6, 2010; CNN, March 18, 2010) During the post-presidential election
    unrest in 2009, Ramin was on medical leave from his military service. His
    family noted that although he was not politically active, his sense of
    justice drew him to participate in protests against the election results.
    (Green Path of Hope, November 28, 2010) "Ramin voted for Mr. Musavi," his
    mother recalled. He wasn t involved in politics, but he cared about what
    was right. He went into the streets to defend his vote and stood with the
    people. He always insisted that we are Iranian and must not depend on
    foreigners. (Association in Support of Families of the Dead and Detainees,
    June 22, 2010) On June 15, 2009, around noon, as the demonstrations were
    gaining momentum, he left home to visit his sister near Sadeghiyeh Square.
    Unlike his usual farewells, he told his father something the family would
    never forget: "If you don't see me again goodbye." At around 7:30 p.m., he
    called his mother to say he was on his way home. It was the last time they
    heard his voice. (Rooz Online, April 6, 2010) 2009 Election - Background
    Election returns from Iran s June 12 th , 2009, presidential election
    declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote.
    Following the announcement, citizens disputing these official results
    demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging services were disrupted
    starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the election and remained
    unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st. On Election Day, the
    deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any gathering of
    presidential candidates supporters throughout the country. The same
    evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing their
    presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
