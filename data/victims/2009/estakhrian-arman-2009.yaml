    Estakhrian s arbitrary execution According to existing information, Mr.
    Arman Estakhrian participated in a demonstration at Molasadra Street on
    June 24, 2009. During this protest, plain-clothes forces and anti-riot
    police blockaded the street at both ends and attacked people. During this
    clash, Mr. Arman Estakhrian was hit with a baton. People transferred him
    to Namazi Hospital near the clash location. He went into coma due to a

    in Shiraz on July 21, 2009. Officials Reaction No official confirmed or
    denied the beating and death of Mr. Arman Estakhrian by the anti-riot
    police. Mr. Arman Estakhrian s family kept silence about his killing and
    its connection to the anti-government demonstration. According to the
    interviewee, the reason for this silence was their family relationship
    with an influential official. The latter had reportedly claimed that Mr.
    Estakhrian s death was due to injuries caused by a car accident at
    Molasadra Street. This source rejected the possibility of such an accident
    as the cause of death for several reasons including the fact that the
    street was closed due to the demonstration so there was no traffic. It is
    said that after the rushed burial, his family, who lived in a low income
    neighborhood of Shiraz, moved to a rich neighborhood of the city that the
    family income did not allow. According to the interviewee, employees of
    the hospital where Mr. Estakhrian was kept reported to a third pary that
    no reception of any accident victim and one of them confirmed that he went
    into coma due to blows of a baton. Also, a person, who works at Molasadra
    Street in Shiraz, had witnessed him being beaten by the anti-riot police.
