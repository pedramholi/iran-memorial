    Meysam was fatally shot by a Basij militiaman merely for defending a young
    woman who was being violently beaten and arrested. He was the first victim
    of the 2009 post-election protests. Information regarding the arbitrary
    execution of Mr. Meysam Ebadi, son of Asghar, has been gathered from
    reports published in Khabar Online (May 6, 2014), IRNA (February 16,
    2014), Rooz Online (June 17, 2011; June 15, July 3, and September 27,
    2010), Kalame (May 18, 2011), HRANA (December 24, 2010), Where Is My Vote?
    (August 15, 2010); Fars News Agency (June 11, 2009); ISNA (February 9,
    2010); Etemaad-e Melli newspaper (June 16 and July 23, 2009); Green
    Movement of Freedom (July 24, 2009); Mardomsalari newspaper (June 16,
    2009); and Negah-e Sabz Blog (November 22, 2011). Meysam Ebadi was born in
    1992 and lived in the Kianshahr neighborhood of Tehran. He was the
    youngest child in a large family with three sisters and two older
    brothers. At age 16, he dropped out of school to work in a tailoring
    workshop because his father, a heavy truck driver, could no longer work
    due to cervical arthritis. Meysam s income helped support the household.
    Describing his son, Meysam s father stated, "Meysam was a good boy. He
    never complained about working. He was always content with what he had."
    He added, "If anyone in the neighborhood harassed a girl, Meysam would
    always stand up to them" (Where Is My Vote?, August 15, 2010). Following
    the announcement of the 2009 presidential election results, Meysam went to
    Vali-e Asr Square on June 14 with his friends. Then-President Ahmadinejad
    was scheduled to deliver a speech there. (Where Is My Vote?, August 15,
    2010). 2009 Election - Background Election returns from Iran s June 12 th
    , 2009, presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with
    62.63 percent of the vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing
    these official results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging
    services were disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the
    election and remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st.
    On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any
    gathering of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country.
    The same evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing
    their presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
    reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protesters took part in
    peaceful demonstrations in Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on
    June 19th after Ayatollah Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced
    his support for Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were
    responsible for any disorder and its consequences. Amnesty International
    stated that the speech gave legitimacy to police brutality. The next day
    and thereafter, police and plainclothes paramilitary groups attacked the
    protesters. Public gatherings of any kind were declared illegal, and
    police, motorcycle-riding special units wearing black uniforms and
    helmets, and plainclothes agents brutally enforced this restriction.
    Individuals in civilian clothing, commonly referred to as plainclothes
    forces, are used in the Islamic Republic to disrupt political and trade
    union activities, student events and gatherings, electoral initiatives,
    and protests. Armed with sticks and clubs, and sometimes with chains,
    knives, batons, or firearms, they emerge when the state decides to
    suppress dissent. These plainclothes forces move ab
