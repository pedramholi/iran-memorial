    Was hanged at the age of 29 for a crime he had not committed but confessed
    under severe toture Information about Mr. Heshmat Emami s execution was
    obtained through Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interview with Mr. Emami s
    attorney on August 25, 2016 (ABC interview). News regarding the execution
    was published in Iran Newspaper (January 20, 2009). Mr. Emami was born in
    1979-80 to a poor family in the village of Hajiabad in the city of
    Kazerun, Fars Province. Mr. Emami left high school when he was a sophomore
    and started working as a laborer at the age of 15. Mr. Emami s case
    pertains to the the murder of an individual on May 22, 2003, during a
    fight over financial issues. One of Mr. Emami s friends, who had lent some
    money to his uncle, asked Mr. Emami to help him recover the money he was
    owed. Mr. Emami s friend had taken a Kalashnikov rifle to intimidate the
    borrower. When the borrower refused to pay the debt, a clash took place
    between them, and a bullet was fired from the rifle. The bullet hit the
    ground, ricocheted and injured the groin area of the borrower s right
    foot, resulting in his death (ABC interview). Arrest and detention In
    June/July 2003, the city of Kazerun s police first arrested Mr. Emami s
    friend and then, based on the information they obtained from him, Mr.
    Emami (Iran Newspaper). The circumstances of Mr. Emami s arrest and
    detention are not known. During his detention, Mr. Emami was severely
    tortured for the sake of extracting a confession. According to Mr. Emami s
    attorney, during his detention at the Criminal Investigator (judiciary
    police) s detention facility in the city of Kazerun, Mr. Emami was
    severely tortured for the sake of extracting a confession. After some time
    and for unknown reasons, Mr. Emami was transferred from Kazerun Prison to
    Shiraz Prison and was held in Shiraz Prison until his execution (ABC
    interview). Trial According to available information, the prosecutor of
    the city of Kazerun confirmed the indictment issued against Mr. Emami and
    his friend, and the case was transferred to Branch 2 of the
    Public-Criminal Court in Kazerun. Mr. Emami did not have access to the
    lawyer until the case was transferred to the court. Mr. Emami did not have
    access to the lawyer until the case was transferred to the court. The
    Branch 2 of the Public-Criminal Court in Kazerun tried Mr. Emami and his
    friend on August 16 and November 22, 2003. The second court session for
    both defendants lasted less than 20 minutes. Charges The charge brought
    against Mr. Emami was intentional murder . Mr. Emami was accused of being
    the one who fired the rifle. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt Iran newspaper cited the
    confessions of two defendants and the crime scene reconstruction as the
    grounds for issuing a conviction verdict for Mr. Emami and his friend.
    According to oral statements made by Mr. Emami and another defendant in
    court, which was also available in the case records in writing, Mr. Emami
    s friend (the other defendant) shot the rifle. According to Mr. Emami s
    attorney, the Public-Criminal Court in Kazerun sentenced Mr. Emami based
    on testimony of witnesses . International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense In an interview with ABC, Mr.
    Emami s attorney described his defense in court as follows: 1) The
    forensic medical expert s report stated that the path of bullet in the
    victim s body goes from the bottom up, which confirms the defendants
    claims that they shot the bullet at the ground (not aiming at the victim).
    This means that the shooting was not intended to kill the victim. 2) The
    bullet hit the ground and ricocheted and accidentally injured the groin
    area of the victim s right foot. Since the victim was not the target of
    shooting, and the area where the bullet struck s not considered to be a
    vulnerable part of the body, the nature of the crime must be treated as
    involuntary manslaughter rather than intentional murder. 3) During
    interrogations, the defendants were subject to torture to elicit
    confessions of guilt. Before the shooting, Mr. Emami s friend was carrying
    the rifle. After leaving the victim s house, some of the witnesses saw the
    rifle in Mr. Emami s hand. There was serious doubt about the exact time
    when the rifle was exchanged between the two defendants, and which of the
    two defendants had shot the rifle. In order to obtain a confession, the
    defendants were severely tortured,and their confession in such
    circumstances is devoid of legal value. 4) According to oral statements
    made by Mr. Emami and another defendant in court, which was also available
    in the case records in writing, Mr. Emami s friend (the
