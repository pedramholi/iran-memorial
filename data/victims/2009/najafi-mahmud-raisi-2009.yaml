    He made it home to his wife, which was remarkable, given the touch-and-go
    situation. His bona fides as a construction worker probably helped.
    Information about Mr. Mahmud Ra isi Najafi was taken from the Saham News
    website on September 2, 2009. This website is affiliated with the Etemad
    Melli Party , which is led by Mehdi Karrubi, a candidate in the 2009
    presidential election. The report posted on this site refers to a meeting
    between Mr. Ra isi Najafi s father, wife, and Mehdi Karrubi. Mr. Ra isi
    Najafi worked in construction. He told his wife on June 15, 2009, that
    when he was returning home from work that day, he passed by Azadi Square
    in Tehran, where he saw a group of people running away from another group
    carrying arms and batons. He said, These armed forces caught me, hit me
    with batons, kicked me, and injured me badly. Mr. Ra isi Najafi lost
    consciousness. When he regained consciousness he found himself in a
    vehicle with a few other injured individuals. He believes that the other
    persons inside the vehicle were either unconscious or dead. With
    difficulty, he caught the attention of the drivers. He convinced them that
    he was simply coming back from work and was completely unaware of what was
    happening at the Azadi Sqaure. I think one of them felt sorry for me and
    he threw me out of the vehicle, Mr. Ra isi Najafi told his wife. A few
    people gathered around him, and took him home in a taxi. Mr. Ra isi Najafi
    got home at 10:30 p.m., drenched in blood and could hardly stand up.
    According to his family members, Mr. Ra isi Najafi remained alive for
    another 13 days after the assault by pro-government armed forces. His
    family did not take him to a hospital, for fear of being punished by
    government officials. His legs and stomach were very swollen. On June 27,
    2009, Mr. Ra isi Najafi s condition deteriorated and his family brought
    him to a hospital only to be told that due to a lack of beds he would have
    to go back home. He died the following morning at home. Mr. Mahmud Ra isi
    Najafi s exact cause of death is not known. Emergency paramedics took his
    body to the Forensics Office at the Kahrizak detention center. Police
    officers said that there was a bullet in his body, but did not provide any
    further clarification. According to Mr. Ra isi Najafi s father, police
    told him that he did not have the right to investigate the matter or file
    a lawsuit. The family persisted in trying to retrieve his body and bury
    him. A few days after his death and after the type of gun that shot him
    was identified the family recovered Mr. Ra isi Najafi s body from the
    Forensics Office and buried him. Fearful of state officials, the family
    did not mention the circumstances of his death in the obituary. Background
    Election returns from Iran s June 12th, 2009, presidential election
    declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote.
    Following the announcement, citizens disputing these official results
    demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging services were disrupted
    starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the election and remained
    unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st. On Election Day, the
    deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any gathering of
    presidential candidates supporters throughout the country. The same
    evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing their
    presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
    reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protester
