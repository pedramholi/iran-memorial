    At 20, he felt ready to work and moved from Lorestan Province to Tehran,
    seeking a job. His cousin, who was filming election events, took him to
    see what was going on. Information about Mr. Sajjad Qa ed Rahmati was
    taken from a letter from a person whose family lives in the same
    neighborhood as the Qa ed Rahmati family in the city of Dorud, in the
    western province of Lorestan. This person who lives outside Iran heard the
    story from Mr. Qa ed Rahmati s mother, while on a trip to Iran. The letter
    has been published on various blogs and websites including Green Iran and
    Peyk-e Iran (July 29, 2009). Mr. Qa ed Rahmati s name also appears on the
    list of casualties of the post-2009 presidential elections unrest, posted
    on the Parcham website (October 3, 2009); the list of Names of Martyred
    Workers from the Green Movement (April 27, 2010); as well as the Green
    Innocent Martyrs website. Mr. Qa ed Rahmati was born on March 21, 1989. A
    resident of the western city of Dorud, he came to Tehran to work. He and
    his cousin attended a demonstration protesting the result of the 2009
    presidential election. His cousin was filming the events at the protests.
    Video footage has been posted on various websites, including YouTube,
    which shows an injured person. The video is reportedly filmed by Mr. Qa em
    Rahmati s cousin, who stopped filming as soon as he realized the injured
    person was Sajjad. Mr. Qa em Rahmati was shot and killed at 6 p.m. near
    the Navad metro station and the Lolagar Mosque. According to the Innocent
    Martyrs of the Green Movement website, this incident happened on June 20,
    2009, although the letter from the neighbor from Dorud states that the
    incident occurred on June 21. At the time of his death, Sajjad was 20
    years old. After days of public protests against the presidential election
    result, the state s suppression entered a new phase on June 20, 2009.
    Public gatherings were violently suppressed by Basij and plain clothes
    forces in various parts of Tehran. Basij forces shot people from the
    rooftop of their base within the Lolagar Mosque, which is located at the
    intersection of Chamran and Azarbaijan streets. Several individuals were
    injured or killed. The exact number of casualties is unknown. On June 25,
    2009, footage of Basijis shooting from the rooftop of their base was
    broadcast by various news channels, including Al Jazeera. Additionally,
    there are other video clips taken with cell phone cameras posted on
    YouTube, which clearly show two persons being shot. In reaction to this
    attack, the Basij base at the Lolagar Mosque was set on fire by angry
    protesters. On June 21, state-run television reported that several
    individuals were killed due to a fire at the Lolagar Mosque started by
    rioters during early evening prayers the previous night. However, video
    footage, broadcast on Iranian television, showed that the incident
    occurred during the day. Additionally, the report of the deaths was
    refuted on the same day by Radio France Internationale (June 21, 2009).
    State officials demanded a monetary sum in order to return Mr. Qa em
    Rahmati s body to his family. The family was only able to pay this amount
    with the help of other Dorud residents. They brought his body back to
    Dorud to bury him. State authorities threatened the Qa em Rahmati family
    and warned them against publicizing their son s death. Their neighbor s
    letter says that the family did not publicize the news of Mr. Qa em
    Rahmati s death because they were afraid and because they do not know how
    to use the internet. Background Election returns from Iran s June 12th,
    2009, presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with
    62.63 percent of the vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing
    these official results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging
    services were disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the
    election and remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st.
    On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any
    gathering of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country.
    The same evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing
    their presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requestin
