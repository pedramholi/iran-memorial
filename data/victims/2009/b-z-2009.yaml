    interested in a girl to whom he had proposed a few times; however, the
    girl s father was strictly against the marriage of the two. The case of
    Mr. Z. B. pertains to the murder of the father of the girl he was
    interested in. Arrest and Detention After the Police Criminal
    Investigation Department of Shiraz had been informed via a telephone call
    of the murder of a man on August 21, 2004, Mr. Z. B. was arrested during
    the initial phase of police investigation and moved to the Police Criminal
    Investigation Department station of Shiraz. According to the available
    information, the accused admitted to the murder in the course of his
    interrogation. However, there is no information available on the details
    of his arrest and detention. Trial Branch 122 of the Public Court of Fars
    Province tried Mr. Z. B. However, there is no information available on the
    session or sessions of his trial. Charges The court charged Mr. Z. B. with
    premediated murder. He was accused of fatally shooting the father of the
    girl he was romantically interested in with four bullets. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt

    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Z. B. defended himself by
    stating that he had not intended to murder the victim, but that he only
    wanted to scare him off by showing him the Colt (Khabar-e Jonoub daily,
    January 29, 2009). He also added that the four bullets had been fired
    accidentally (E temad daily, January 31, 2009). However, there is no more

    relatives of the victim in Adelabad Prison, Shiraz on the morning of
    Wednesday, January 28, 2009.
