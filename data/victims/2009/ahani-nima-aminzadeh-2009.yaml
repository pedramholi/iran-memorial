    was fatally shot three times by officers while completely unarmed and
    unable to flee Information regarding the death of Mr. Nima Aminzadeh
    (Ahani) son of Masoumeh and Adel, has been obtained through Boroumand
    Center research and interviews with Mr. Adel Aminzadeh (September 26 and
    27, 2017) and Mr. Hamid Aminzadeh (July 19 and 31, 2017, and September 25,
    2017). Additional information in this regard was obtained through Fars
    News (February 27, 2009), Asr-e-Iran website (February 24, 2009), Laton
    News (February 27, 2009), neighbors testimony, and court documents related
    to the Aminzadeh family s lawsuits. Mr. Nima Aminzadeh was born on June
    20, 1978 in the city of Astara, Iran. He had a high school diploma and
    never married. He worked as a real estate agent. Mr. Aminzadeh's father
    described him as an honest, kind, and lively youth with an interest in
    sports. According to him, Nima was very popular among the people of Astara
    (Boroumand interview with Mr. Adel Aminzadeh, September 27, 2017).
    According to Mr. Nima Aminzadeh's brother, Nima was not involved in any
    political activity (Boroumand Center interview with Mr. Hamid Aminzadeh,
    July 31, 2017). In 1984, Mr. Aminzadeh's father changed the surname of the
    family from Ahani to Aminzadeh. Mr. Aminzadeh's Death According to
    available information, at 6:00 PM on February 24, 2009, law enforcement
    officers took action to arrest Mr. Nima Aminzadeh on Farabi Street in the
    city of Astara. While arresting Mr. Aminzadeh, the officers shot him three
    times and killed him. At the time of the arrest, Mr. Nima Aminzadeh was
    not carrying any weapons, and the bullets were shot from a very close
    distance, while he was not able to escape. A number of local residents who
    witnessed the incident signed testimony explaining the event (the
    neighbors testimony is available at the Boroumand Center). According to
    Mr. Hamid Aminzadeh, Mr. Nima Aminzadeh s brother, on the day of the
    incident Nima was in a store near their home to repair his cell phone.
    Several law enforcement officers, attempting to arrest him, forcefully
    took him out of the store. At this time, Mr. Aminzadeh started fighting
    with an officer who was pulling his clothing from behind. Mr. Hamid
    Aminzadeh quoted Nima s other brother, Mohammad, who witnessed the
    incident and said that at the time of the arrest a police officer lowered
    himself on one knee, put his gun behind Nima's legs, and shot. Nima fell
    on the ground and pulled himself into a computer game arcade. Meanwhile,
    the officer shot at Nima s waist and the bullet hit the store s security
    glass and ultimately hit the arcade s owner after injuring Nima. The
    police officer then walked into the store and fired the third bullet to
    Nima's chest. Other officers entered the store and started beating Nima
    with their boots and batons, then grabbed Nima's foot and took him to the
    sidewalk outside the store. Mr. Amin Aminzadeh, Nima s older brother, came
    out of their home after hearing the screams and gunfire and threw himself
    on Nima s injured and bloody body. At this time, police officers attacked
    Amin and after beating him, handcuffed him on the bed of the police s
    pickup truck. Police officers then put Nima s injured body in the same
    pickup truck and transferred them both to the hospital (Boroumand Center
    interview with Mr. Hamid Aminzadeh, July 19, 2017). Officials failure to
    deliver Mr. Nima Aminzadeh s body to his family and their refusal to issue
    a death certificate were among the issues that raised doubt and ambiguity
    for Aminzadeh s family regarding the exact manner and time of Nima s
    death. However, Nima s father, who was able to visit Nima in the hospital,
    stated that he had seen injuries on Nima s chest and feet and declared
    that Nima died due to these injuries and that he personally closed Nima s
    eyes after his death (Boroumand Center interviews with Mr. Adel Aminzadeh,
    September 26 and 27, 2017). According to a report by Laton News, a wounded
    Mr. Nima Aminzadeh was taken to the Mohammadzadeh Hospital in the city of
    Astara by the police. Physicians' efforts to save his life were not
    successful and he died in the hospital (Laton News, February 27, 2009).
    Mr. Nima Aminzadeh was 30 at the time of his death. Officials Reaction
    According to officials, the attempt to arrest Mr. Nima Aminzadeh was part
    of plan to deal with thugs. In their coverage of Mr. Aminzadeh s death at
    police hands during his arrest, official media outlets claimed that he was
    known as Iron Man and engaged in many criminal activities, such as armed
    extortion (Asr-e-Iran website, February 24, 2009 and Laton News, February
    27, 2009). The Imam for Friday prayers in Astara described Mr. Nima
    Aminzadeh as one of the criminals and villains of the region, and
    expressed appreciation of what police did in dealing with the city of
    Astara's thugs (Fars News, February 27, 2009). According to available
    information, police officers arrested Mr. Nima Aminzadeh s older brother
    (Amin), who was present at the scene
