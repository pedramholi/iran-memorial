    Information regarding the execution of Mr. Abodllah Farivar Moghaddam was
    obtained from numerous sources including the IRNA website, quoting
    Mazandaran Province Judiciary s Office of Public Relations (February 21,
    2009), Meydan-e Zanan ( Women s Square ) (February 19, 2009), the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand interview with the author of the Meydan-e Zanan
    report based on the court decision, the certificate of Sigheh or temporary
    marriage , and an interview with a person close to Mr. Farivar, Etemad
    newspaper (February 21, 2009), and BBC Persian (February 19, 2009).
    Additional information was obtained through other sources.* Mr. Farivar
    was 50 years old, married, with 2 children. He was a music instructor in
    the city of Sari. In 2005, Mr. Farivar entered into a temporary marriage
    with his student. According to available information, Mr. Farivar
    Moghaddam s case was related to sexual offenses . Arrest and detention
    Based on available information, following the filing of a complaint by the
    father of one of Mr. Farivar s female students at the Sari General
    Prosecutor s Office on December 5, 2004, alleging Eghfal (enticing,
    deceiving, or duping someone into engaging in sexual relations) of her
    16-year-old daughter, Mr. Farivar Moghaddam was summoned and detained by
    Sari Criminal Court Branch Two. Upon the issuance of a court order, he was
    turned over to Sari Police Force where he was kept for 21 days, from
    February 7, 2005 until February 28, 2005. During detention, Mr. Farivar
    Moghaddam was interrogated by the Police Force Information Office agents
    and was subjected to physical and psychological torture in order to
    provide a forced confession. Trial Mazandaran Province Criminal Court,
    Branch Two tried Mr. Farivar over several sessions. The sessions took
    place on March 6, April 15, and December 17, 2005. The first trial session
    convened in the presence of the Police Force Information Office agents.
    Mr. Farivar had an attorney. (Meydan-e Zanan, February 19, 2009). Charges
    The court accused Mr. Farivar Moghaddam of adultery (as a married man) .
    He was accused of having sexual relations with his student prior to
    entering into temporary marriage with her, while he was married to his
    wife. (Meydan-e Zanan, February 19, 2009). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities.) Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt Based on available information, Mr.
    Farivar Moghaddam s confessions and the complaint brought by his student s
    father formed the basis for the issuance of the sentence against him. On
    February 7, 22, and 28, 2005, while in detention, he confessed to having
    had sexual relations with his student in the city of Babol, prior to the
    temporary marriage. Furthermore, at the trial session of March 6, 2005, he
    confessed to having had sexual relations prior to marriage. (Meydan-e
    Zanan, February 19, 2009). International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense After the March 6, 2005 trial
    session, Mr. Farivar denied his previous admissions in subsequent sessions
    and stated that those confessions had been made under physical and
    emotional duress and under threats by the Police Force Information Office
    agents during detention. (Meydan-e Zanan, February 19, 2009). Two years
    before the sentence of stoning was upheld by the Supreme Court, Mr.
    Farivar sent a letter to judicial authorities in which he stated: On
    December 5, 2004, Mr. Abbas Ghannad filed a complaint with the City of
    Sari General Prosecutor s Office against me, Abdollah Farivar Moghaddam,
    alleging Eghfal [that I had enticed and duped] his daughter Naghmeh Sadat
    Ghannad, [into having sexual relations] and requested that the case be
    sent to the Sari Police Force Information Office to be investigated. On
    December 13, 2004, Mr. Ghannad stated at the Sari Police Force Information
    Office: I have a daughter who is now 21; after her treatment, and in order
    to strengthen her spirits, I sent her to learn to play keyboards with Mr.
    Abdollah Farivar Moghaddam, where my daughter learned to play keyboards.
    Recently I noticed that Mr. Farivar had taken advantage of my daughter s
