    After being released from Kahrizak, Ramin had visible signs of physical
    trauma, including bruises, leg wounds, a fractured skull, and severe
    cervical and spinal injuries. He said that he had been hung by his hands
    and beaten. Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Mr. Ramin
    Aqazadeh Qahremani was obtained from the Norooz news agency (August 5 and
    9, 2009), as well as interviews with his mother for Rooz Online (July 23,
    2011), Jaras (July 16, 2014), Radio Farda (May 2012), and an interview
    with Ramin's brother with Jaras news agency (July 22, 2011). Additional
    information was gathered from articles in Norooz News (October 2, 2009);
    Tabnak (January 27, 2010); the Analytical News Agency Alef (January 23,
    2010); Radio Farda (May 14, 2012); BBC Persian (July 2, 2012); Tasnim
    (September 12, 2016); Tribune Zamaneh (September 15, 2016); and a witness
    testimony from the Kahrizak Detention Center (December 2008). Ramin
    Aqazadeh Qahremani was born in Tehran in 1979. He lived with his family in
    the Shahrara neighborhood and had three brothers. They described him as a
    calm, harmless, apolitical young man who was closely attached to his
    family. (Norooz, August 9, 2009). 2009 Election - Background Election
    returns from Iran s June 12 th , 2009, presidential election declared
    Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote. Following
    the announcement, citizens disputing these official results demonstrated
    in the streets. Text messaging services were disrupted starting at 11:00
    p.m. on the night before the election and remained unavailable for nearly
    three weeks, until July 1st. On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian
    police announced a ban on any gathering of presidential candidates
    supporters throughout the country. The same evening, security forces made
    a show of strength, increasing their presence in Tehran s public squares
    to reinforce security at polling stations. Officials at election
    headquarters began reporting results soon after midnight, despite a
    statement from the Minister of the Interior that the first returns would
    not be announced until after the morning prayer (around 4:00 a.m.). Many
    supporters of other presidential candidates came out into the streets on
    June 13th, once the results were made public, to protest what they
    believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir Hossein Musavi, Mehdi
    Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors in the race,
    contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud. They filed
    complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional body charged
    with vetting candidates before elections take place and approving the
    results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for a new
    election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
    reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protesters took part in
    peaceful demonstrations in Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on
    June 19th after Ayatollah Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced
    his support for Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were
    responsible for any disorder and its consequences . Amnesty International
    stated that the speech gave legitimacy to police brutality. The next day
    and thereafter, police and plainclothes paramilitary groups attacked the
    protesters. Public gatherings of any kind were declared illegal, and
    police, motorcycle-riding special units wearing black uniforms and
    helmets, and plainclothes agents brutally enforced this restriction.
    Individuals in civilian clothing, commonly referred to as plainclothes
    forces , are used in the Islamic Republic to disrupt political and trade
    union activities, student events and gatherings, electoral initiatives,
    and protests. Armed with sticks and clubs, and sometimes with chains,
    knives, batons, or firearms, they emerge when the state decides to
    suppress dissent. These plainclothes forces move about freely, violently
    beating protesters and arresting them, while the police passively look on
    or actively cooperate with them. There is little information on the
    command structure and organization of such groups, whose members wear
    ordinary clothing rather than official uniforms and may be affiliated with
    the ministry of information, influential political groups, or the armed
    forces. Following the post-election demonstrations in June 2009, pictures
