    It took five days for his family to find him and to pay for his return.
    The last street he had walked past, Enqelab street, bears a message of
    Revolution. Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Hamid
    Hosseinbeig Araqi, son of Fatemeh and Majid, was obtained from interviews
    conducted with his parents by the Jaras news website (July 12 and
    September 19, 2010) and by Youth for Human Rights, quoting Jaras
    (September 17, 2011). Additional information was gathered from Iran Khabar
    Agency (June 29, 2009); Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) (August
    17, 2009); Fars News Agency (June 13, 2010); Radio Farda (June 21, 2013);
    and the official forensic certificate archived by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center (ABC). Hamid Hosseinbeig Araqi was born in 1988 and was
    the eldest child in a family of four living in District 15 of Tehran.
    (Iran Khabar Agency, June 29, 2009; Jaras, September 19, 2010). Hamid was
    an athletic, educated young man who was calm and quiet. He was deeply
    devoted to his family and, unlike many others his age, was not interested
    in spending time with friends. He preferred to spend his free time at
    home. He once told his parents: "If God gives me the chance, I have
    beautiful plans for us I want the rest of our lives to be full of joy."
    (Iran Khabar Agency, June 29, 2009; Jaras, September 19, 2010). According
    to his family, Hamid had no specific political affiliation, yet he
    participated enthusiastically in the 2009 presidential election. (Jaras,
    July 12, 2010). 2009 Election - Background Election returns from Iran s
    June 12 th , 2009, presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
    re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote. Following the announcement,
    citizens disputing these official results demonstrated in the streets.
    Text messaging services were disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night
    before the election and remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until
    July 1st. On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a
    ban on any gathering of presidential candidates supporters throughout the
    country. The same evening, security forces made a show of strength,
    increasing their presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security
    at polling stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting
    results soon after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the
    Interior that the first returns would not be announced until after the
    morning prayer (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential
    candidates came out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were
    made public, to protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election.
    Candidates Mir Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i,
    Ahmadinejad s competitors in the race, contested the election, alleging
    many instances of fraud. They filed complaints with the Council of
    Guardians, the constitutional body charged with vetting candidates before
    elections take place and approving the results afterwards, requesting an
    annulment and calling for a new election. Before the Council of Guardians
    could review their claims, however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah
    Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad on his re-election. In the meantime,
    many people active in Karubi s and Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On
    June 15th, unprecedented demonstrations filled the streets of central
    Tehran, in which an estimated three million protestors participated,
    according to statements attributed to the mayor of Tehran. As the
    demonstrations were ending, paramilitary forces attacked the marchers,
    injuring and killing several people. To prevent such news from being
    broadcast, the Iranian government expelled foreign journalists from the
    country and banned news agencies from reporting on the events. Over the
    next three days, protesters took part in peaceful demonstrations in
    Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on June 19th after Ayatollah
    Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced his support for
    Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were responsible for any
    disorder and its consequences . Amnesty International stated that the
    speech gave legitimacy to police brutality. The next day and thereafter,
    police and plainclothes paramilitary groups attacked the protesters.
    Public gatherings of any kind were declared illegal, and police,
    motorcycle-riding special units wearing black uniforms and helmets, and
    plainclothes agents brutally enforced this restriction. Individuals in
    civilian clothing, commonly referred to as plainclothes forces , are used
    in the Islamic Republic to disrupt political and trade union activities,
    student events and gatherings, electoral initiatives, and protests. Armed
    with sticks and clubs, and sometimes with chains, knives, batons, or
    firearms, they emerge when the state decides to suppress dissent. These
    plainclothes forces move about freely, violently beating protesters and
    arresting them, while the police passively look on or actively cooperate
    with them. There is little
