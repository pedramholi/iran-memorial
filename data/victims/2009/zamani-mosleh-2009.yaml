    The 17-year-old Kurd who was executed for a love affair with a 27-year-old
    woman. The execution of Mr. Mosleh Zamani was reported by several sources
    including BBC Persian (December 17, 2009), Jaras (December 18, 2009), VOA
    (December 18,2009), the United States Department of State (March 11,
    2010), and Amnesty International (December 17, 2009). Additional
    information regarding this matter was obtained from interviews of Mr.
    Zamani s family by BBC Persian, the TV program RahaiZan (The Organization
    for Emancipation of Woman,) and other sources*. Mr. Zamani was a young,
    unmarried Kurd from Dadaneh, a village in the central district of Sanandaj
    county. He was 17 years old at the time of the incident. International law
    strictly prohibits the death penalty for people who commit a crime under
    18 years of age. As a member of the International Covenant on Civil and
    Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran is
    legally obligated not to execute anyone for crimes committed as a minor.
    The issuance and execution of Mr. Zamani s sentence provoked many domestic
    and international reactions owing to his young age and the nature of the
    allegations in the case. The European Union, Amnesty International, and
    Human Rights Watch issued separate statements condemning the execution.
    Amnesty International accused Iran of violating the International Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the
    Child. In July 2007 (after the ruling became final) and in December 2009
    (before the execution), following the request of the Committee To Save
    Mosleh Zamani from Execution dozens of civil activists, citizens of
    Sanandaj, and residents of Zamani s village gathered in front of the
    Ministry of Justice building in Sanandaj holding placards. They signed a
    petition objecting to the sentence and demanded that the execution be
    overturned. (HRANA, Iranians of England) Arrest and detention Sanandaj law
    enforcement officials arrested Mr. Zamani in 2003 while he was with his
    girlfriend near Sanandaj and transferred him to Sanandaj Prison (BBC). He
    would spend six years in Sanandaj Central Prison. In December 2009, a few
    days before the execution, he was transferred to solitary confinement in
    Dizel Abad, Kermanshah (VOA). The circumstances of the defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. He was 17 at the time of his arrest. Trial
    Branch 103 of the Sanandaj Criminal Court tried Mr. Zamani in 2005.
    According to an interview with Zamani s brother, the court didn t allow
    his family to be present in the courtroom (Amnesty International). No
    information is available regarding the defendant s trial. Charges
    Available information indicates that Mr. Zamani was accused of raping his
    girlfriend (Amnesty Internation). According to his sister, the court also
    accused Mr. Zamani of sedition (Persian BBC, Amnesty International). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of basic guarantees of fair trial.
    International Human Rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against political opponents and executed them on pretexts of drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of people have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that have failed to
    meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted based
    on such fabricated charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to Mr.
    Zamani s sister, the affidavit prepared locally against Zamani by three
    villagers was the warrant for the court s verdict (Persian BBC). According
    to Amnesty International, Mr. Zamani and his girlfriend reported that that
    they had sexual intercourse with mutual consent. Mr. Zamani and his
    girlfriend had emphasized before the judge that they had sexual
    intercourse with mutual consent. The judge did not accept their claim,
    saying He should be executed to serve as a lesson for other Iranian young
    people . The report of this execution does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense According
    to a release by Amnesty International, Mr. Zamani s trial was not fair and
    judicial officials failed to allot him proper time to defend himself.
    According to his sister, Mr. Zamani s girlfriend announced to the court
    that she had no complaint against him. According to Amnesty International,
    Mr. Zamani and his girlfriend had emphasized before the judge that they
    had sexual intercourse with mutual consent. The judge did not accept their
    claim, saying He should be executed to serve as a lesson for other Iranian
    young people . On December 14, 2009, after the ruling became final, Mr.
    Zamani s girlfriend s letter of consent was presented to judicial
    authorities for the second time in order to prevent his execution. It had
    no effect. Mr. Zamani s request for pardon was rejected by the court
    (Rozhane). In an interview with th
