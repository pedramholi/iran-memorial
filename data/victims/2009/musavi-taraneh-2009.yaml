    She was learning to cut hair. She wouldn t admit her presence at
    demonstrations, though friends saw her there. News of the killing of Ms.
    Taraneh Musavi was published on the websites of Radio Zamaneh on September
    21, 2009, Students of Nushirvani Technical University in Babol on August
    25, the BBB Iran Newsletter on August 21, HRANA (Human Rights Activists
    News Agency) on July 28 and August 21, Hammihan on August 20, Jamejam on
    August 19, ILNA (Iranian Labor News Agency) on August 11, Pejvak Iran on
    July 18, and the Association of Iranian Political prisoners (in exile),
    which quoted the Zirzamin weblog on July 14, 2009. News of the
    disappearance and death of Ms. Taraneh Musavi was first published by
    weblogs inside Iran on July 14 and 18, 2009. According to Pejvak, quoting
    the Zirzamin weblog, A friend of Taraneh Musavi who wanted to remain
    anonymous stated that Taraneh had a haircut class near the intersection of
    Mirdamad and Shari ati [in Tehran] on June 28. She parked her car on a
    street near Hosseinieh Ershad and Mirdamad. When she saw people gathering
    on Qoba Street and around Hossenieh Ershad, she called a friend and said
    that they should check out the Qoba Mosque before going to the haircut
    class and set up a meeting with her friend near the Qoba Mosque. According
    to her friend, she was arrested, wearing a green manteau and green
    headscarf, by government agents at Shari ati Street, while waiting for her
    friend. This friend saw her being arrested while approaching their meeting
    location. Taraneh was taken away in a van. The evidence of her arrest was
    not limited to this report. Some of those who were arrested during the
    Qoba Mosque incident contacted her family and informed them of her arrest.
    While in detention, Taraneh Musavi gave her home phone number and the
    phone number of a friend to some of the detainees and asked them to inform
    her family of her arrest in case they were released. Those [detainees],
    who were transferred, along with Taraneh, to a building near Pasdaran
    [Avenue], stated that she was crying and saying repeatedly that she had
    not been there to participate in the demonstration but merely to attend
    her haircut class. However, some of her friends stated that Taraneh had
    been present during peaceful demonstrations on June 15, 16, and 17, 2009
    and that even before the election, she had participated in the Green Chain
    to express her support for reform and freedom in Iran. According to the
    Pejvak website, on July 17, a friend of Taraneh Musavi called her parents
    house to ask about her, but received the news of her death and discovery
    of her burned body on a road between Karaj and Qazvin. The family avoided
    speaking about the time and place of her burial ceremony and stated that
    they could not offer more explanation. After many calls and follow up
    attenmpts by friends of Taraneh, her family demanded that her friends not
    call anymore and that it was best for them to be silent. HRANA on July 28,
    2009, quoted the International Committee Against Capital Punishment
    saying, Taraneh Musavi, according to several detainees, was seen last at
    the Basij Base where she was interrogated. Basij agents separated this
    young girl from the other detainees and raped her. Taraneh Musavi was
    raped brutally several times by several Basij agents. She lost
    consciousness due to severe injuries of her uterus and vagina. Noticing
    her grave condition, Basiji agents took her to the Imam Khomeini Hospital
    in Karaj, hoping to relate the injuries of her uterus, vagina, and anus to
    a driving accident. At the hospital, however, the physician s examination
    indicated that the cause of injuries had been rape and not an accident.
    With coordination and advice of their higher ranking officials, Basiji
    agents, who became confused and worried, took the unconscious and
    half-dead body of Taraneh from the hospital and ordered hospital personnel
    to remain silent about this incident. A nurse, who wants to remain
    anonymous, however, identified Taraneh Musavi. According to the BBB Iran
    Newsletter, the Head of Basij personally interrogated some of the
    detainees from the Qoba Mosque gathering on June 28, 2009. According to
    this site, the detention site was separate from the interrogation and
    torture rooms. Detainees were handed over to interrogators at the entrance
    of the interrogation room and no guard or other personnel, except
    interrogators, could enter this building. They did not even know what
    happened beyond those walls and what techniques were used for torture. Ms.
    Musavi was seen last by those who worked in the complex when she was taken
    to the interrogation building. Unlike other prisoners, who were returned
    to the detention center after torture and interrogation, she never
    returned from the interrogation building. According to this website, with
    the order of the head of Basij, Ms. Musavi s name was dropped from the
    detainees list the next day. This was against regulations and without
    justification. According to this source, there ar
