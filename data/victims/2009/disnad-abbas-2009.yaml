    He was a business owner. His shop stood on Karun Street, within walking
    distance of home. Life with the family was good, in spite of an injury
    from the Iran-Iraq war. Information about Mr. Abbas Disnad s death was
    taken from interviews with his wife by Saham News* (August 20, 2009) and
    by Rooz Online (April 12, 2010). His name is mentioned in the list of 72
    Martyrs of the Green Movement by Ali Reza Beheshti (a campaign manager for
    the 2009 presidential candidate Mir Hossein Musavi), which was published
    on the Norooz website on September 4, 2009, and the list Names of Martyred
    Workers of the Green Movement (April 27, 2010). Mr. Disnad was born on
    December 20, 1961. He owned a store on Karun Street in Tehran. He was
    married and had two children. During the Iran-Iraq War (September 1980
    August 1988), he fought on the frontlines and was injured. On June 20,
    2009, Mr. Disnad closed his store around 5:00 p.m. and was on his way home
    when he was hit in the head with a baton by security forces. His family
    was unaware of what happened to him until late in the evening when someone
    contacted them from the Shahriar hospital. According to the information
    available, three persons who were injured that day died at the Shahriar
    hospital that same day. Mr. Disnad died in the hospital on June 24, 2009.
    After days of public protests against the presidential election result,
    the state s suppression entered a new phase on June 20, 2009. Public
    gatherings were violently suppressed by Basij and plain clothes forces in
    various parts of Tehran. Officials Reaction According to Mr. Disnad s
    wife, a resident of Karun Street (where Mr. Disnad s store is located)
    stated that when he was hit and fell to the ground, state agents prevented
    passers-by from taking him to a hospital and he laid on the ground for
    hours. Doctors from the Shahriar Hospital told his wife that if he been
    taken to a hospital earlier, the chances of his survival would have been
    much greater. The state agents returned Mr. Disnad s body to the family on
    the condition that the family proclaim he had died of a heart attack. The
    coroner s death certificate was not given to the family. Based on the
    information available, officials did not investigate Mr. Disnad s death.
    His son says, we have followed up but nobody gives us an answer. They tell
    us to go and come back later. We ask when we should come back, they say
    they do not know (Saham News). Family s Reaction After Mr. Disnad s
    burial, his family filed a complaint at the criminal prosecution office.
    His wife says that after some time, someone contacted her from the
    governor s office and said, it has been proven that your husband was
    innocent. She says that she will follow up on the case. Her son states, My
    father was innocent when he was killed. We just do not want his life to go
    to waste (Rooz Online). Background Election returns from Iran s June 12th,
    2009, presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with
    62.63 percent of the vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing
    these official results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging
    services were disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the
    election and remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st.
    On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any
    gathering of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country.
    The same evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing
    their presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
