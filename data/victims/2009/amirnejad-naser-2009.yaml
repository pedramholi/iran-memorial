    72 Martyrs of the Green Movement," a list compiled by a senior advisor to
    presidential candidate Mir Hossein Musavi and published on the Norooz
    website on September 4, 2009. Additionally, information about the shooting
    from the Ashura Battalion base on June 15, 2009 was obtained through an
    interview conducted by the Boroumand Foundation with an eyewitness who was
    present at the scene. Mr. Amirnejad was born in Mahmudabad, a village near
    Yasuj. He was 26 years old, single, and a senior aerospace engineering
    student at the Science and Research Branch of Islamic Azad University in

    friend of his recalled: "June 12, 2009 arrived, and Naser, like many of
    his classmates, entrusted his vote to people he trusted. But what
    misplaced trust it was!" He continued: "I clearly remember how excited
    Naser was about the elections. Despite his simplicity, he participated in
    meetings and entered the political arena. He was a young man who just
    wanted his country to prosper. He knew nothing about political divisions
    or the darkness of politics" (Negin Taj Blog, June 2010 June 2011). Mr.
    Amirnejad and his friends participated in the large Tehran rally on June
    15, 2009, protesting the election results. 2009 Protest - Background
    Election returns from Iran s June 12 th , 2009, presidential election
    declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote.
    Following the announcement, citizens disputing these official results
    demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging services were disrupted
    starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the election and remained
    unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st. On Election Day, the
    deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any gathering of
    presidential candidates supporters throughout the country. The same
    evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing their
    presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
    reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protesters took part in
    peaceful demonstrations in Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on
    June 19th after Ayatollah Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced
    his support for Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were
    responsible for any disorder and its consequences . Amnesty International
    stated that the speech gave legitimacy to
