    The information about Ali Reza Tavassoli was collected from the following
    websites: the Amir Kabir University Newsletter (AUTNEWS; August 5, 2009),
    Parliament News (August 5, 2009), Green Freedom Wave (August 17, 2009);
    and Saham News* (August 5 and 8, 2009). According to the information
    available, Ali Reza, who was 12 years old at the time, was hit in the head
    with a baton and died at a memorial ceremony for Ms. Neda Aqasoltan on
    July 30, 2009 at the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. His family members
    retrieved his body from coroner s office on August 3, 2009. The Iranian
    Parliament ordered a truth commission to investigate this case. One of the
    members of this commission stated, Unfortunately, my colleagues and I were
    not aware of this incident until now, since nobody has informed me or my
    colleagues about this (Saham News, August 5, 2009). Pro-government sources
    have reported conflicting information regarding the cause and date of Ali
    Reza s death. On August 8, 2009, Saham News reported that one of the
    members of the Parliamentary truth commission stated that he was injured
    in a car accident in Saveh (in the Central Province) in late June , two
    days prior to the memorial ceremony for Ms. Aqasoltan (which took place on
    July 30). This source stated that Ali Reza died due to injuries sustained
    in the car accident. Similarly, on August 8, Channel 2 of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) company aired a report in which
    sources who claimed to be Mr. Tavassoli s family members stated that he
    died on June 29, after a car accident. The Young Journalist Club,
    affiliated with IRIB, also published a report similar to that of the IRIB
    on its website (August 10, 2009). It has been reported that Iranian
    officials have threatened victims family members, demanding their silence
    and that they not agree to be interviewed. Reports also allege that
    returning a victim s body to a family has been made conditional upon their
    agreement to change the cause of death listed on the coroner s certificate
    to that of a heart attack or some other natural cause thus foregoing the
    right to file a complaint as well as an agreement not to hold memorial
    services for the loved one. Dr. Ali Reza Beheshti,** an advisor in the
    Mirhossein Musavi campaign told Radio Farda, one of the problems we face
    is that family members of those dead or arrested during the recent events,
    either have certain concerns, or are threatened and pressured not to
    publicize information (August 11, 2009). Dr. Beheshti is also the
    spokesman of the committee which was ordered to investigate the status of
    prisoners and those injured in the aftermath of the presidential election.
    This committee s operations were shut down by security agents after it
    published a list entitled, 72 Martyrs of the Green Movement ). On August
    17, the Green Freedom Wave website stated that a reliable source has
    confirmed that Ali Reza died after being hit in the head with a baton at
    the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery and stated that, two prominent reformist
    politicians have established an investigative committee, which has
    approved the authenticity of this report. International laws have strictly
    prohibited capital punishment for those who were under the age of 18 at
    the time of committing a crime. As a party to the International Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the
    Child, Iran has the obligation not to impose capital punishment for an
    offense committed before the age of eighteen. Background Election returns
    from Iran s June 12th, 2009, presidential elections declared Mahmoud
    Ahmadinejad to have been re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote.
    Following the announcement, citizens disputing these official results
    demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging services had been disrupted
    since 11:00 p.m. on the night before the election and remained unavailable
    until July 1st. On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police
    announced a ban on any gathering of presidential candidates supporters
    throughout the country. On the same evening, security forces made a show
    of strength, increasing their presence in Tehran s public squares to
    reinforce security at polling stations. At election headquarters, the head
    official began reporting results soon after midnight, despite a statement
    from the Interior Minister that the first returns would not be announced
    until after the morning prayer (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of
    other presidential candidates came out into the streets on June 13th, once
    the results had been made public, to protest what they believed to be a
    fraudulent election. Candidates Musavi, Karubi, and Reza i, Ahmadinejad s
    competitors in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances
    of fraud. They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians [the
    constitutional body charged with vetting candidates before elections take
    place and approving the results afterwards], requesting an annulment and
    calling for a new election. Before the Co
