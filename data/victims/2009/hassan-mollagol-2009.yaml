    News of the execution of Mr. Mollagol Hassan along with nine others was
    published by various sources including the Iran newspaper (January 22,
    2009,) Amnesty International (August 2015,) Radio Farda (January 27,
    2009,) Human Rights Watch (May 1, 2009,) and the International Committee
    Against the Death Penalty (January 13, 2015.) According to the existing
    information, Mr. Hassan s case was related to the murder of an Afghan
    citizen on November 14, 2004. Mr. Hassan was himself an Afghan citizen and
    only 17 years old when arrested. International laws have strictly
    prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18
    at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil
    and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran
    has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed
    before the age of eighteen. The execution of Mr. Hassan was met with
    objections by international human rights organizations. Amnesty
    International, Human Rights Watch, and the International Committee Against
    the Death Penalty issued statements condemning the execution of children
    in Iran. In addition, the European Union issued a statement objecting the
    execution of Mr. Hassan and stated that the execution of those who
    committed a crime when under legal age is absolutely unjustifiable and
    against international laws (Radio Farda.) Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Hassan s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Branch 74 of the Criminal Court in Tehran tried Mr. Hassan. No information
    is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Hassan
    was announced as murder. According to the Iran newspaper, he was accused
    of murdering a fellow Afghan national named Fakhrodin in order to steal
    his money on November 14, 2004. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Hassan. Defense Mr. Hassan was younger than
    18 when the incident occurred. No information is available on his defense.
    Judgment Branch 74 of the Criminal Court in Tehran condemned Mr. Mollagol
    Hassan to death. He was hanged along with nine others in the yard of
    Tehran s Evin Prison on the morning of January 21, 2009 (Iran newspaper.)
