    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.

    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence entered against Mr. Hossein S. Defense There
