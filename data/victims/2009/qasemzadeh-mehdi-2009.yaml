    To Ayatollah Khamenei from inside prison: Your tyranny is like leprosy
    that slowly gnaws at - and eats away - the flesh. You are like an extreme
    heat that evaporates [and destroys] everything this nation possesses: its
    life, sources of life, religion, integrity, principles, mercy, and
    fairness. News of Mr. Mehdi Qasemzadeh s execution was published in
    numerous sources, including the Yarsan Website (February 28, 2009); and
    Human Rights Activists in Iran (February 28, 2009); the Fars News Agency
    published the news of the execution of an Ahl-e Haq prisoner without
    mentioning a name (March 1, 2009), quoting the chief of the West
    Azarbaijan Province Police Force Information Center. Additional
    information was obtained from an interview with Mr. Qasemzadeh s sister
    and one of his co-defendants with Gunaz TV; (Prosecutor General s
    website): Summary of Insistent Criminal Case number 11/86. The report:
    Belief-based Genocide: Miandoab Qushachai [Region s] Ahl-e Haq Qizilbashan
    [People], published on the Yurd.net website (October 29, 2014), as well as
    from other sources.* Mr. Mehdi Qasemzadeh was a single, 27-year-old high
    school graduate. He was an [ethnic] Turk from Miandoab s village of
    Uchtappeh, who worked at a cattle farming complex owned by Mr. Soltanali
    Mohammadi. Mr. Qasemzadeh was a follower of the Atashbeigi Branch of Ahl-e
    Haq. (Qizilbashan tribe s of Azerbaijanies Alavi) Ahl-e Haq Ahl-e Haq is
    an internal, mystical faith, founded in the 14thcentury by Sulta Eshaq. It
    is established upon deeply felt spiritual and religious premises. Although
    Ali Ibn Abitaleb, the first Shi a Imam, holds an important and pivotal
    place in Ahl-e Haq beliefs, this creed is not, however, solely an Islamic
    sect; it encompasses a collection of Zoroastrian, Manichaeist, Christian,
    and Jewish beliefs. Ahl-e Haq believes in resurrection (the continuation
    of life after death in another body) and in unity (God entering a body,
    object, or place), but does not believe in judgment day (heaven and hell).
    Purity, truth, nonexistence (degenerating desires to reach to or toward
    God), and reda (sacrificing oneself and providing services to help human
    beings) are the four pillars of Ahl-e Haq. Kalam-e Saranjam is their
    central holy book. Jamkhaneh is their place of worship and collective
    prayer, which, in most regions, is accompanied by the musical instrument,
    the tanbur. Ahl-e Haq adherents live in Iran in parts of the provinces of
    Kurdistan, Kermanshah, Azarbaijan, Zanjan, Hamedan, and Lorestan, as well
    as in Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Albania, and Afghanistan. Sultan Eshaq divides
    the Ahl-e Haq into seven main Families, to which four other Families were
    added in the 18th and 19th centuries, among them the Atashbeigi Family.
    The leader of the Atashbeigi Family is Nezamoddin Mosha shai. The
    Atashbeigi live in the regions of Lorestan, Hersin in Kermanshah, and
    Ilkhchi in Azarbaijan. Summary of Events The commanding officers
    insistence that one of the Ahl-e Haq soldiers shave his mustache, and his
    refusal to do so, caused the latter to run from the military base where he
    was serving in July and August 2000. His father, Soltanali Mohammadi, and
    a number of the residents of Miandoab s Uchtappeh village wrote letters to
    local and state authorities, including the Ministry of the Interior, the
    Majles (Iranian Parliament) Commission on Principle 90 [of the
    Constitution], and the Leader of the Islamic Republic, asking that Ahl-e
    Haq s beliefs be respected, and that military base [residents] and other
    administration [personnel] refrain from insulting and offending them. They
    also objected to employment discrimination and early retirement of Ahl-e
    Haq followers because of their beliefs. Uchtappeh residents follow-ups and
    open letters in the years 2001 to 2003 bore no fruit and at times provoked
    the security forces to react and exert further pressure. In 2002-03, Mr.
    Soltanali Mohammadi s action in publishing a book on Ahl-e Haq s beliefs
    and in installing signs at the entrance to his cattle farming complex
    bearing Ahl-e Haq themes, caused local authorities to react to and prevent
    the same, as well as to summon and temporarily arrest a number of Ahl-e
    Haq followers. The Town [of Miandoab s] Security Council s Resolution to
    remove the signs, and a group of Ahl-e Haq followers insistence on their
    religious beliefs, ultimately resulted in two armed clashes in September
    and October 2004 at Uchtappeh s cattle complex. The first clash began when
    a large contingent of the police force conducted a widespread attack
    against the cattle farming complex on September 22 and occupied it, using
    semi-heavy military equipment. The second clash consisted of a
    counter-attack to take back the complex on September 28. These two clashes
    resulted in the death of six villagers and three police officers, and the
    wounding of twenty others. The commander of Miandoab s police force, as
    well as Soltanali Mohammadi and his son, were among the dead. Mr. Mehdi
