    The news of Mr. Vahid Sh. s execution, along with two other persons, was
    published by Keyhan newspaper (November 18, 2009) and Nesfe Jahan

    with drug possession . He was accused of buying and possessing 143.7 gr of
    crack cocaine. There is no detailed information about his charges. The

    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Vahid Sh. Defense No information is available on Mr. Vahid Sh.
    s defense. Judgment Isfahan Revolutionary Court sentenced Mr. Vahid Sh. to
    execution. According to available information, Mr. Vahid Sh. had twice
    requested pardon and mitigation of her punishment from execution to life
    in prison, but his requests were rejected by the Amnesty and Forgiveness
    Commission of Isfahan province (Nesfe Jahan newspaper, November 19, 2009).
    His sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court. On Monday morning, November
    16, 2009, Mr. Vahid Sh. was hanged in Isfahan Central Prison.
