    Mr. Hashemzadeh had a strong passion for the arts. He was a professional
    musician who played the santur and Harmonica. He was also talented in
    drawing and painting and had recently taken an interest in sculpture.
    Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Mr. Mas'ud Hashemzadeh,
    son of Fatemeh Mohseni, has been gathered from the BBC Persian website
    (July 21, 2009), the Mourning Mothers blog (July 21, 2009; June 20, 2010),
    Radio Farda (July 24, 2009), the Green blog (July 23, 2009), Rooz Online
    (July 23, 2009; October 22, 2009; June 20, 2010; September 25, 2011), and
    report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran (March 03, 2012). Mr. Hashemzadeh was born on
    September 7, 1981, in Valiabad village, a district of Zibakenar in
    Mazandaran Province. He lived with his family in an apartment on North
    Zanjan Street in Tehran (Green Blog, July 23, 2009; Mourning Mothers Blog,
    July 21, 2009; Rooz Online, June 20, 2010). Mr. Hashemzadeh received his
    high school diploma in experimental sciences. He had a deep passion for
    art. He played the santur and harmonica professionally and was skilled in
    drawing and painting. He also developed a keen interest in sculpture.
    According to his mother, he was calm, composed, hardworking, meticulous,
    and never gave up until he mastered whatever he set out to do. He spent
    much of his time at home reading, watching films, and playing music. His
    love for cinema was so profound that he amassed an extensive personal
    movie collection (Mourning Mothers blog, July 21, 2009). Among his friends
    and acquaintances, Mas'ud was known for fearlessly sharing his opinions,
    being sensitive to injustice, and unable to stay silent in the face of
    wrongdoing. Whenever he saw something unfair, he didn't look away
    indifferently (Rooz Online, June 20, 2010). Those close to him said that
    Mas'ud was not politically active. However, during the 2009 presidential
    election, something changed in him. Filled with hope for the future, he
    encouraged his family to vote and participate in shaping the country s
    destiny. His mother recalled with emotion: "He only voted twice in his
    life once for President Khatami and once for presidential candidate Mr.
    Musavi." He mobilized the whole family, saying, 'This time, we all have to
    vote.' My son cared deeply about the people and his country. He had become
    so hopeful. I had never seen Mas'ud this cheerful before (Rooz Online,
    June 20, 2010). 2009 Election - Background Election returns from Iran s
    June 12 th , 2009, presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
    re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote. Following the announcement,
    citizens disputing these official results demonstrated in the streets.
    Text messaging services were disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night
    before the election and remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until
    July 1st. On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a
    ban on any gathering of presidential candidates supporters throughout the
    country. The same evening, security forces made a show of strength,
    increasing their presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security
    at polling stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting
    results soon after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the
    Interior that the first returns would not be announced until after the
    morning prayer (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential
    candidates came out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were
    made public, to protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election.
    Candidates Mir Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i,
    Ahmadinejad s competitors in the race, contested the election, alleging
    many instances of fraud. They filed complaints with the Council of
    Guardians, the constitutional body charged with vetting candidates before
    elections take place and approving the results afterwards, requesting an
    annulment and calling for a new election. Before the Council of Guardians
    could review their claims, however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah
    Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad on his re-election. In the meantime,
    many people active in Karubi s and Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On
    June 15th, unprecedented demonstrations filled the streets of central
    Tehran, in which an estimated three million protestors participated,
    according to statements attributed to the mayor of Tehran. As the
    demonstrations were ending, paramilitary forces attacked the marchers,
    injuring and killing several people. To prevent such news from being
    broadcast, the Iranian government expelled foreign journalists from the
    country and banned news agencies from reporting on the events. Over the
    next three days, protesters took part in peaceful demonstrations in
    Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on June 19th after Ayatollah
    Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced his support for
    Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were responsible
