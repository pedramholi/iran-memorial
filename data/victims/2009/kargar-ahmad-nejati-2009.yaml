    After a week and a half, he emerged from his coma. He asked attendants to
    call his home phone, which they did. Everything that happened to him, just
    before or after his arrest, is officially not known. The information about
    Ahmad Nejati Kargar was drawn from Human Rights Activists in Iran s
    website (September 14, 2009). This report quotes a letter written by his
    family members that refers to an admission form from the hospital where
    Mr. Nejati Kargar died. He is also among the 72 Martyrs of the Green
    Movement, by Dr. Ali Reza Beheshti (the son of Seyed Mohammad Hosseini
    Beheshti, who was one of the founders of the Islamic Republic Party). The
    list was published on the Norooz News website on September 4, 2009. Mr.
    Nejati Kargar was arrested in early July 2009, after the protests against
    the presidential election result. He was detained for a few days, and on
    an unknown date he lost consciousness while in custody. According to an
    admission form from Loqmanoddoleh Hospital, he was admitted to the
    hospital on July 13, 2009 at 8:25 p.m., while he was still unconscious.
    This hospital form states that he had a lung infection, was hemorrhaging,
    and his kidneys were only three percent functional. Mr. Nejati Kargar woke
    up from his comatose state on July 22 and gave hospital personnel his home
    phone number. His family members, who were unaware of his whereabouts for
    almost 10 days, came to visit him in the hospital. Hospital staff did not
    inform the family how Mr. Nejati Kargar was injured. He underwent daily
    dialysis treatment and complained of kidney pain. He told his family
    members that in detention, he was blindfolded and hit in the head with
    batons. Family members witnessed that his waist had turned black. On
    August 6, 2009, his family was informed that he had died in hospital. The
    primary cause of death and the reason why Mr. Nejati Kargar lost
    consciousness are not known. The hospital form states that the cause of
    death is unknown. His body was sent to the Forensic Office for an autopsy.
    On August 8, 2009, his father told officials that he was not going to
    press charges and Mr. Nejati Kargar s body was returned to the family. An
    image of an invitation to memorial ceremonies for Mr. Nejati Kargar was
    published on the Norooz News website. The state-run television network of
    the Islamic Republic broadcast a program denying that Mr. Nejati Kargar
    was dead (between September 4 and 14, 2009). The Javan News website, also
    affiliated with the government, posted a similar report on September 10,
    2009, stating that Mr. Nejati Kargar was alive. His family protested the
    state-sponsored media reports and wrote a letter stating, Why should the
    Iranian television network broadcast such a report and upset his mourning
    father? He goes to the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery every day, [and] sits by
    the grave just to make sure that his son s body is not exhumed and taken
    away Ahmad was buried on August 8, 2009 in Section 213, Row 15, Number 35
    of the Behesht-e Zahra [cemetery]. The report, broadcast on the national
    television, about him being alive is completely false. Background Election
    returns from Iran s June 12th, 2009, presidential election declared
    Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote. Following
    the announcement, citizens disputing these official results demonstrated
    in the streets. Text messaging services were disrupted starting at 11:00
    p.m. on the night before the election and remained unavailable for nearly
    three weeks, until July 1st. On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian
    police announced a ban on any gathering of presidential candidates
    supporters throughout the country. The same evening, security forces made
    a show of strength, increasing their presence in Tehran s public squares
    to reinforce security at polling stations. Officials at election
    headquarters began reporting results soon after midnight, despite a
    statement from the Minister of the Interior that the first returns would
    not be announced until after the morning prayer (around 4:00 a.m.). Many
    supporters of other presidential candidates came out into the streets on
    June 13th, once the results were made public, to protest what they
    believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir Hossein Musavi, Mehdi
    Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors in the race,
    contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud. They filed
    complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional body charged
    with vetting candidates before elections take place and approving the
    results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for a new
    election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, acc
