    was a gifted child and an honor student at the Medical School of Tabriz
    University The news of Mr. Ramin Pourandarjani s death was covered by many
    media outlets, including Khabar Online and BBC Persian (November 16,
    2009). Additional information about the case has been obtained from
    interviews and research conducted by Boroumand Foundation, the newspapers
    Hamshahri (November 18, 2009) and Kayhan (December 2, 2009), the websites
    of Rooz Online (May 23, 2010), Radio Farda (March 5, 2013), and Amnesty
    International (November 18, 2009), and several *other sources. Mr. Ramin
    Pourandarjani was born on 9 June 1983 to a middle class family in a
    northwestern district of the city of Tabriz. He was a physician and
    military conscript. His father, Reza, worked in the Tabriz Historical
    Bazaar. His mother, Rouhangiz, was a retired teacher, and his brother an
    engineering student. Mr. Pourandarjani was an intellectually gifted
    person. He was fluent in English and French, as well as Persian and
    Turkish, and loved poetry and literature. When he was eleven years old, he
    was admitted to a school for gifted students in Tabriz. At the age of
    thirteen, he won a national youth poetry competition, and, at fifteen, he
    placed first in the Kharazmi Scientific Festival. In 2001 he began his
    medical studies at the University of Ardabil having ranked 1,069 among
    hundreds of thousands of Iranian students who took the national entrance
    exam that year. He subsequently transferred to the medical school at the
    University of Tabriz, and graduated top of his class with distinction in
    2008. He intended to continue his education in Germany and had asked his
    mother to find him a suitable girl to marry. Mr. Pourandarjani loved his
    chosen vocation. In his graduation speech, he said to his fellow students:
    We are heirs to great names; luminaries such as Galen, Hippocrates,
    Avicenna and the wise Al-Juzjani. We have been left to carry the legacy of
    an incredibly remarkable holy spirit from those eras, transmitted to us in
    the form of a white gown. We are here to say that we will continue this
    path with passion. He began his compulsory two-year military service in
    2008. In April 2009, he was deployed for a month on the Sistan-Baluchestan
    border region, before being dispatched to serve as a conscript physician
    at FATEB (the Persian acronym for Greater Tehran Law-Enforcement Force
    Command), which involved examining prisoners at Kahrizak detention center
    once a week. Based on available information, during the unrest that
    followed the June 2009 elections, Mr. Pourandarjani was summoned to
    Kahrizak detention center four times in the course of three weeks to treat
    detainees. The death of Mr. Pourandarjani caught the attention of human
    rights organizations. Amnesty International called on the Iranian
    authorities to investigate his suspicious death. 2009 Election -
    Background Election returns from Iran s June 12 th , 2009, presidential
    election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63 percent of the
    vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing these official
    results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging services were
    disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the election and
    remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st. On Election
    Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any gathering
    of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country. The same
    evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing their
    presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
