    He was the first journalist killed during the 2009 post-election protests.
    His family received his body after 27 days, encased in concrete and cement
    blocks. Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Mr. Ali Reza
    Eftekhari was obtained from the websites of the Amir Kabir Newsletter
    (July 30, 2009), Parcham (October 3, 2009), and Committee of Human Rights
    Reporters (July 15, 2009). Additional information was obtained from the
    websites of Pejvak-e Iran (July 24, 2009), Rooz Online (July 28, 2011),
    and Radio Farda (September 28, 2014). Mr. Eftekhari, 29 years old, was a
    senior journalist at the Abrar-e Eqtesadi newspaper for five years until
    2008 (Amir Kabir Newsletter, July 30, 2009) According to the available
    information, Mr. Eftekhari was a calm, reliable, and patient person. Due
    to his father's illness, he was the breadwinner of the family. (Radio
    Farda, September 28, 2014) Background on the 2009 Election Election
    returns from Iran s June 12 th , 2009, presidential election declared
    Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote. Following
    the announcement, citizens disputing these official results demonstrated
    in the streets. Text messaging services were disrupted starting at 11:00
    p.m. on the night before the election and remained unavailable for nearly
    three weeks, until July 1st. On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian
    police announced a ban on any gathering of presidential candidates
    supporters throughout the country. The same evening, security forces made
    a show of strength, increasing their presence in Tehran s public squares
    to reinforce security at polling stations. Officials at election
    headquarters began reporting results soon after midnight, despite a
    statement from the Minister of the Interior that the first returns would
    not be announced until after the morning prayer (around 4:00 a.m.). Many
    supporters of other presidential candidates came out into the streets on
    June 13th, once the results were made public, to protest what they
    believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir Hossein Musavi, Mehdi
    Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors in the race,
    contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud. They filed
    complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional body charged
    with vetting candidates before elections take place and approving the
    results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for a new
    election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
    reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protesters took part in
    peaceful demonstrations in Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on
    June 19th after Ayatollah Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced
    his support for Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were
    responsible for any disorder and its consequences . Amnesty International
    stated that the speech gave legitimacy to police brutality. The next day
    and thereafter, police and plainclothes paramilitary groups attacked the
    protesters. Public gatherings of any kind were declared illegal, and
    police, motorcycle-riding special units wearing black uniforms and
    helmets, and plainclothes agents brutally enforced this restriction.
    Individuals in civilian clothing, commonly referred to as plainclothes
    forces , are used in the Islamic Republic to disrupt political and trade
    union activities, student events and gatherings, electoral initiatives,
    and protests. Armed with sticks and clubs, and sometimes with chains,
    knives, batons, or firearms, they emerge when the state decides to
    suppress dissent. These plainclothes forces move about freely, violently
    beating protesters and arresting them, while the police passively look on
    or actively cooperate with them. There is little information on the
    command structure and organization of such groups, whose members wear
    ordinary clothing rather than official uniforms and may be affiliated with
    the ministry of information, influential political groups, or the armed
    forces. Following the post-election demonstrations in June 2009, pictures
    of some plainclothes agents were posted on internet websites. Internet
    users helped to identify some of them and provided evidence that these
    individuals were affiliated with the Basij paramilitary groups, the
    Revolutionary Guard Corps, and state intelligence forces. On September 16,
