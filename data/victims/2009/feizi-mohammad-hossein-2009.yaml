    When Mr. Feiz s wife told the family he hadn t come home, they searched
    everywhere they could think of but found no sign of him. Eventually, they
    got a call from Mohammad Hossein s phone. During the call, they were
    informed that Mr. Feiz had been shot. Information regarding the arbitrary
    execution of Mohammad Hossein Feiz, son of Gholamreza, was obtained from
    Radio Farda (May 18, 2014) and HRANA (July 21, 2009). Mr. Feiz s name
    appears on numerous lists of individuals killed during the 2009
    post-election protests. Additional information was gathered from the Iran
    newspaper (June 28, 2009); the Jaras Green Path of Hope website (September
    21, 2011); the Dana News Network (December 30, 2014); Sorkheh website
    (2013); Shams, the Oppressed Green Martyrs website (date unknown); and
    Pezhvak-e Iran (date unknown). Little is known about Mr. Feiz's personal
    life, including his exact date of birth. According to his mother, however,
    he was born on the last day of the lunar calendar month of Rajab. Because
    his birthday fell between the anniversaries of the Prophet Muhammad s
    mission (Mab ath) and the birth of Imam Hussein, the third Shia Imam, he
    was named Mohammad Hossein (Tasnim News Agency, December 30, 2017). Mr.
    Feiz was born into a traditional religious family in Sorkheh and grew up
    in Mashhad. He obtained a high school diploma in accounting and completed
    his military service with the Student Basij Organization. According to his
    mother, he married after finishing his military service and had a
    two-year-old child. He later moved from Mashhad to Tehran, where he worked
    with his brother at a tech company (Dana News Network, December 30, 2014;
    Tasnim News Agency, December 30, 2017; Sorkheh website, 2013). In an
    interview with the state-run Tasnim News Agency, Mr. Feiz s mother said
    that he participated in mourning ceremonies for the Prophet s household
    (Ahl al-Bayt) since childhood. She added that Mohammad Hossein joined the
    Student Basij in middle school. He was a professional martial artist and
    served as a physical education instructor at the Shahid Qa em Basij base
    in Mashhad (Tasnim News Agency, December 30, 2017). Mr. Feiz s father was
    described as "a staunch supporter of the Supreme Leader of the Islamic
    Republic and former President Mahmud Ahmadinejad." For this reason,
    official sources did not label him a protester (Radio Farda, May 18, 2014;
    Tasnim News Agency, December 30, 2017). However, multiple other media
    outlets reported that Mohammad Hossein Feiz participated in the protests,
    citing "friends and relatives" or "another family member." These sources
    noted that "he was constantly worried and upset during the tense days
    following the 2009 presidential election." They also stated that "there is
    much left unsaid about Mohammad Hossein, but for certain reasons, they
    have been forced to remain silent" (Radio Farda, May 18, 2014; Pezhvak-e
    Iran, quoting the Committee of Human Rights Reporters, undated). 2009
    Election - Background Election returns from Iran s June 12 th , 2009,
    presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63
    percent of the vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing these
    official results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging services were
    disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the election and
    remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st. On Election
    Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any gathering
    of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country. The same
    evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing their
    presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the mar
