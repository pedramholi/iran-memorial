    Violence in the 2009 election aftermath included plain clothes enforcers,
    sent about to crush would-be opponents. Mr. Hashemi happened to be one
    such opponent. News of the killing of Mr. Iman Hashemi was published on
    the websites of the Human Rights Activists News Agency on July 28, 2009,
    the Green Innocent Martyrs website, as well as the list 72 Martyrs of The
    Green Movement, by a campaign advisor of Mr. Mirhossein Musavi, a
    presidential candidate, published on the Noruz website on September 4,
    2009. According to available information, Mr. Hashemi was shot by plain
    clothes security forces on Azadi Street in Tehran on June 20, 2009.
    Following demonstrations protesting the results of the presidential
    election, on June 20, 2009, state suppression entered a new phase. On that
    day, demonstrations turned violent by with the presence of Basij and plain
    clothes agents in various places in Tehran. Mr. Hashemi was buried in the
    Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in Tehran on June 24, 2009. He was 27 years old.
    Background Election returns from Iran s June 12th, 2009, presidential
    election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63 percent of the
    vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing these official
    results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging services were
    disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the election and
    remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st. On Election
    Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any gathering
    of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country. The same
    evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing their
    presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
    reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protesters took part in
    peaceful demonstrations in Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on
    June 19thafter Ayatollah Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced
    his support for Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were
    responsible for any disorder and its consequences. Amnesty International
    stated that the speech gave legitimacy to police brutality. The next day
    and thereafter, police and plainclothes paramilitary groups attacked the
    protesters. Public gatherings of any kind were declared illegal, and
    police, motorcycle-riding special units wearing black uniforms and
    helmets, and plainclothes agents brutally enforced this restriction.
    Individuals in civilian clothing, commonly referred to as plainclothes
    forces, are used in the Islamic Republic to disrupt political and trade
    union activities, student events and gatherings, electoral initiatives,
    and protests. Armed with sticks and clubs, and sometimes with chains,
    knives, batons, or firearms, they emerge when the state decides to
    suppress dissent. These plainclothes forces move about freely, violently
    beating protesters and arresting them, while the police passively look on
    or actively cooperate with them. There is little information on the
    command structure and organization of such groups, whose members wear
    ordinary clothing rather than official uniforms and may be affiliated with
    the ministry of information, influential political groups, or the armed
    forces. Following the post-election demonstrations in June 2009, pictures
    of some plainclothes agents were posted on internet websites. Internet
    users helped to identify some of them and provided evidence that these
    individuals were affiliated with the Basij paramilitary groups, the
