    He had no political affiliation, but he was kind. What he could not stand
    to be was a person who keeps silent in the face of tyranny. Information
    about Mr. Mostafa Karim-Beigi's case was taken from IRNA (December 27 29,
    2009), ISNA (December 30, 2009), Fars News Agency (December 27 30, 2009),
    Iran Police News (December 29, 2009), Behesht-e Zahra Cemetery website,
    Rooz Online (March 14, 2010; January 10, 2011; September 26, 2010;
    December 14, 2010), the video of his father's interview with Voice of
    America (April 19, 2010), Green Path Movement Jaras News Agency (May 22,
    2011; December 29, 2009; January 4, 2010), Ayande News website (December
    30, 2009; January 3, 2010), Report of the Special Rapporteur on the
    situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran (March 03, 2012)
    and Human Rights Activists News Agency, HRANA (December 30, 2009; December
    27, 2013). Mr. Mostafa Karim-Beigi was 26 years old and single, had a
    high-school diploma, and ran his own business. He was not a member of any
    political party or group but, according to his family, was an outspoken
    and freedom-loving person. As a student, he had formed a group named the
    Student Movement of Iran, and he would participate in all the annual
    commemorations of the vigilante attack on student dormitories in 1999.
    Even though he had not voted in the 2009 presidential election, he took
    part in all the mass protests that ensued afterwards, always sporting a
    green scarf around his neck. According to one of his friends, he had
    started debating with one of the Basij members during one of these
    protests, believing that "dialogue is our only weapon, the only way we can
    make our views known to the Basij so they will have an idea what it is we
    are asking for." He underlined the importance of standing up against
    tyranny and was always critical of those who saw tyranny but did not raise
    their voices against it. He had told his mother: "our blood has to be shed
    before things can start to get better." He loved his country and said that
    he would be the first to go and fight for his country should there be a
    war. He was a kind-hearted young man who helped the sick and those in
    need. He had even registered as an organ donor, and his organs were
    donated for transplantation upon his death (his mother's interview with
    HRANA on December 27, 2013 and with Rooz Online on December 14, 2010, and
    his father's interview with Voice of America on April 19, 2010) Based on
    the information available, Mr. Mostafa Karim-Beigi was shot in the
    forehead by the police and plainclothes forces near the College bridge on
    Enqelab (Revolution) Street at around 1 PM on Sunday, December 27, 2009
    (the day of Ashura). He was consequently thrown down from the bridge and
    killed. The Officials' Reaction Police and security forces did not inform
    Mr. Karim-Beigi's family of his death. A statement issued by the Tehran
    Metropolitan Police Headquarters on December 29, 2009 announced the death
    of an unidentified individual as a result of falling from the bridge on
    the day of Ashura. His family was finally able to identify his body in the
    forensic department of Kahrizak Detention Center after 14 days of
    searching for him in hospitals and prisons. According to his mother, the
    forensic department declared the cause of death as "contact with hard
    object" and, in the death certificate, as "contact with sharp object in
    the chest" (Rooz Online, January 10, 2011). Mr. Karim-Beigi's parents were
    pressured to accept the declared cause of death in order to receive their
    son's body. The security officials allowed his burial in Behesht-e Zahra
    Cemetery under the condition that only his parents and sister could attend
    the burial. This time the family did not accept the condition and decided
    to bury their son in the village of Jouqin near Shahriyar. Mr.
    Karim-Beigi's body was buried at 8 PM on January 13, 2010, in silence and
    under strict security. Before the burial, the security forces transported
    his body to Behesht-e Zahra Cemetery for the ritual washing, of which his
    family were not informed and which they could not attend, and then
    escorted the body to the burial place. At the burial, the officers stood
    among and around the people present and took pictures and video (Rooz
    Online, March 14, 2010). The place was filled with plainclothes forces.
    According to his mother, the security officials had pressured the family
    to remain silent and stay away from interviews with the media. Arriving at
    Mr. Karim-Beigi's family home with placards and flowers to commemorate the
    fortieth day of his death, the security forces had tried to claim Mr.
    Karim-Beigi as a praised Basij member, but his family, knowing that he had
    never been associated with the Basij, objected to this performance and
    decided to cancel the fortieth day ceremony for this reason. The complaint
    filed by his family was abandoned with no results. Ms. Shahnaz Akmali
    insists that this was due to the lack of serious will on the part of the
    authorities to find tho
