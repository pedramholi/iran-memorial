    The news of the execution of Mr. A. N. along with three other individuals
    was announced by the websites ofKhabar-e Jonoub daily (March 12, 2009) and
    E temad daily (March 14, 2009). The case of Mr. A. N., 30, pertains to the
    murder of a tenant in his sister s house in Firouzabad, Fars Province.
    Arrest and Detention After the Police Criminal Investigation Departmentof
    Firouzabad was informed of the occurrence of a murder on April 15, 2004,
    Mr. A. N. was identified, arrested and moved to the Police Criminal
    Investigation Departmentstation in Firouzabad. However, there is no
    information available on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial
    Mr. A. N. was tried by Branch Three of the Public Court of Firouzabad. Mr.
    A. N. s sister was among the people who attended the court proceedings.
    However, there is no information available on the session or sessions of
    Mr. A. N. s trial. Charges The court charged Mr. A. N. with murder. He was
    accused of engaging in a fight with the tenant at his sister s place on
    April 15, 2004 and stabbing the tenant with a kitchen knife multiple
    times, which led to the tenant s death. Evidence of Guilt According to the
    available information, Mr. A. N. s confessions became the basis for the
    verdict that was issued against him. During the initial police
    investigation as well as during the court proceedings, Mr. A. N. accepted
    the charge of murder. In addition, the coroner s expert opinion on the
    cause of death of the victim and the statements of Mr. A. N. s sister at
    court were among the pieces of evidence that were entered against him.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense During the court proceedings, Mr. A. N. stated that
    the victim used to be the tenant of his sister, and they used to live in
    the same place. That led him to believe that they were having an illicit
    affair, as a result of which he had engaged in a fight with the tenant
    which led to his murder. Judgment Branch Three of the Public Court of
    Firouzabad sentenced Mr. A. N. to death. Branch 27 of the Supreme Court
    approved the verdict. Mr. A. N. was hanged in Adelabad Prison, Shiraz on
    the morning of March 11, 2009.
