    News of the execution of Ms. Ma sumeh Qal ehchehi was published on the
    weblog of Varesh on January 30, 2009. Additional information was taken
    from the Roozonline website on February 1, 2009, the We-Change website on
    January 28, 2009, and the E temad newspaper on September 10, 2008. Ms. Qal
    ehchehi was 32 years old and married. She was educated and an accounting
    student in her senior year. She liked sports, was very kind and polite,
    and well-liked. Ms. Qal ehchehi was physically and mentally disabled. She
    suffered from seizure, shortness of breath, and psychosis. She felt
    suffocation in certain conditions. At the age of 20, Ms. Qal ehchehi was
    forced to marry her mother s cousin, who was jobless and inadequately
    educated. After two years of engagement, she began her married life. Ms.
    Qal ehchehi did not love her husband and had no sexual relationship with
    him during her eight months of marriage. Her case was related to the
    killing of her husband during a stressful incident. Arrest and detention
    There are contradictory reports regarding the date and circumstances of
    Ms. Qal ehchehi s arrest. According to two sources, the incident and
    arrest occurred in 1996, and, according to another source, in 2000. Ms.
    Qal ehchehi s attorney stated that she went to judicial authorities,
    explained the incident, and confessed to the unintentional killing of her
    husband. Ms. Qal ehchehi was detained in Rafsanjan Prison for 9, 11, or 12
    years, according to various sources. According to Mr. Abdolsamad
    Khoramshahi, her attorney, she made handicrafts in prison. She always
    worked and provided for her prison costs by working. Ms. Qal ehchehi had a
    difficult life in a 12 square meter room shared with other women prisoners
    with various charges. Her attorney quoted her: One night they bring a
    woman with her four children, another night a woman with addiction,
    another time a mental patient, or a sick woman. One with a bad temper and
    the other a criminal (Roozonline website, We-Change website, and the E
    temad newspaper) Trial No detailed information is available on Ms. Qal
    ehchehi s trial. Charges The charge brought against Ms. Qal ehchehi was
    announced as murdering her husband. (E temad newspaper) The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    Ms. Qal ehchehi went to judicial authorities and explained that the death
    of her husband had been accidental, caused by a whetstone blow to his
    temple. His body, which had been buried in the couple s yard in Anar,
    Yazd, was then recovered. (We-Change website and the E temad newspaper)
    Defense According to Ms. Qal ehchehi, on the day of the incident she was
    working in the kitchen when suddenly her husband grabbed her from behind
    for fun as he usually did. But Ms. Qal ehchehi was shocked and felt that
    she could not breathe. She struggled but could not release herself and
    felt suffocation. She grabbed the first thing she could get a hold of on
    the counter and hit him on the head. Unfortunately, the whetstone hit her
    husband s temple and caused his death. Mr. Abdolsamad Khoramshahi, Ms. Qal
    ehchehi s attorney, was not present during the trial. They talked over the
    phone several times; however, he had limited time to defend her.
    Therefore, she received her signed power of attorney by mail and mailed
    her case documents to her attorney. According to Ms. Qal ehchehi s
    attorney, she did not intend to commit a crime and did not plan it. He
    concentrated her defense on manslaughter. In addition, a stone is not
    considered a murder tool. Ms. Qal ehchehi could not see her back, and
    hitting her husband s temple was accidental. She only intended to release
    herself from the position she was in. Expressing her intense fear, Ms. Qal
    ehchehi stated: In that moment, all I could think of was what my husband s
    family could do to me if they found out and that I wouldn t even make it
    to the police and trial. For this reason, the first thing that came to my
    mind was to escape until things got settled. But after a while, I went to
    the police, confessed, and explained what happened. Because I did not plan
    or intend to kill my husband. Ms. Qal ehchehi s attorney stated that she
    was suffering from seizure, shortness of breath, and psychosis. Therefore,
    he asked the court to send her to forensics for psychological analysis. In
    addition, Ms. Qal ehchehi s family provided documents from a mental
    hospital in Zahedan indicating that she had attempted suicide because of
    severe psychosis and had been hospitalized for a month. (Roozonline
    website, We-Change website) Judgment Ms. Ma sumeh Qal ehchehi was
    condemned to death. The forensics report confirmed her seizure and
    psychosis, but indicated that her illness did not override her will.
    According to the existing information, the Head of the Judiciary in
    Rafsanjan objected to the death penalty sentence against Ms. Qal ehchehi
    and stated that it had been manslaughter. Howe
