    Was a Sunni cleric who had close relationships with the youth, which drew
    the attention of Islamic Republic authorities. News of the execution of
    Mr. Salahadin Seyedi, son of Karimbakhsh, along with his fellow defendant,
    Mr. Khalilollah Zarei , was announced by various outlets including the
    website of Fars News Agency (March 3, 2009), Kayhan daily (March 4, 2009),
    Iranian Students News Agency ISNA (March 3, 2009), the Information Center
    for the Sunni Community Sunni Online (March 5, 2009), and Taftan News
    Agency (May 29, 2009). Additional information on this case was obtained
    from the website of BBC (May 29, 2009) as well as Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center s interview with one of Mr. Seyedi s family members on March 11-15,
    2017 (ABC interview). Mr. Seyedi, known as Hafez Saeid, a Sunni Baluchi,
    was born in the Bandan Village of Sarbaz County in Sistan and Baluchistan
    Province, and lived in Nassirabad Village, Sarbaz County. He was almost
    55, married, and had four children. Mr. Seyedi knew the Quran by heart and
    taught it at the seminary in Nassirabad Village. In addition to teaching,
    he traded in motorcycle accessories. He had an elementary school
    education, and then studied in various seminaries such as Aziziyeh Dar
    al-Oloum of Zahedan and Haghaniyeh Religious Seminary in Iranshahr, and
    then went to Pakistan to complete his religious studies (ABC interview).
    According to one of Mr. Seyedi s acquaintances, he was a religious
    individual and a follower of the Hanafi School of Sunnism. He was a
    sociable person and had a good relationship with people, especially the
    youth, and cared for those around him (ABC interview). The case of Mr.
    Seyedi pertains to support of and membership in the Jondollah Group,
    moharebeh (taking up arms against the holy state), and acting against
    national security in the city of Zahedan. Arrest and detention The
    available information on the time and method of Mr. Seyedi s arrest is
    contradictory. According to the published reports in the state media, in
    May/June of 2008, Mr. Seyedi was arrested along with a group composed of
    27 people during a clash with the police force, the Revolutionary Guards
    and the Basij Force (Fars News Agency, March 3, 2009; Kayhan daily, March
    4, 2009). He was arrested while he was a guest at another s house. Those
    who arrested him did not show a warrant and beat him during arrest.
    According to an acquaintance of Mr. Seyedi, the forces of the Intelligence
    Office of Iranshahr arrested Mr. Seyedi in the village where he lived at 2
    PM on June 16, 2008. Mr. Seyedi was a guest along with a few others at the
    house of his fellow defendant when the security forces raided the house,
    arrested everyone present while beating them, and moved them to the
    detention center of the Intelligence Office of the city of Iranshahr. Two
    days later, Mr. Seyedi was transferred to the detention center of the
    Intelligence Office of Zahedan, where he was kept for four months. Then he
    was moved to Ward 3 of Zahedan Central Prison, known as the ward for
    political prisoners, and was kept there for around five months (ABC
    interview). A month and a half after his arrest, Mr. Seyedi talked to his
    family for the first time on the phone for a few minutes. After two
    months, he was allowed to meet his wife and children for less than 20
    minutes in the presence of two security force personnel in the Information
    Bureau of the Intelligence Office of Zahedan. During this meeting, Mr.
    Seyedi looked very frail and old. His hair had grown grey, and he told his
    family that he had been kept in the solitary for one month where he could
    hear no human voice and was not able to distinguish day from night, and
    the cell was so small that he could not even fully stretch his legs.
    Nevertheless, after a month, another inmate was transferred to that small
    cell. During his detention in the Intelligence Office, Mr. Seyedi was only
    able to call and see his family two or three times. In Zahedan Central
    Prison, Mr. Seyedi was not allowed to meet his family under normal
    conditions, and each time they wanted to meet him, his family had to
    secure the permission of the court. Mr. Seyedi s family had to travel the
    600-kilometer distance between Sarbaz County and the city of Zahedan with
    much difficulty, and, after securing the permission of the Ministry of
    Intelligence, they were required to additionally go to court to secure
    permission for the meeting from the judge (ABC interview). After his
    arrest, the interrogator had told him: Your verdict is death. Be certain
    that you will not leave this place alive. According to the interviewee,
    Mr. Seyedi, due to his long confinement in the solitary cell, had been
    driven to the limits of sanity. He had also been physically and mentally
    abused and harshly tortured with different-sized steel cables as well as
    lashes while tied to the rack, known in the prison as the miracle bed (ABC
    interview). Mr. Seyedi s government-appointed lawyer had met him for the
    first time in Zahedan Central Prison
