    News of Mr. Behnud Shoja i s execution was published by Fars News Agency
    (October 11, 2009), Mohammad Mostafa i s weblog (October 11 and 22, 2009),
    and Iska News (October 11, 2009)* Mr. Shoja i was 21 years old. He was the
    family s only child and had lost his mother at the age of 14; he lived
    with his grandmother. His case was about a group fight at Tehran s Vanak
    Park on August 18, 2005, which resulted in the murder of a 17-year-old
    youth. At the time of the murder, Mr. Shoja i was 17. One of Behnud s
    prison mates says that he was calm in prison and did not cry. He prayed.
    In contrast to many other youths who become addicted to drugs and learn
    numerous other crimes, [not only did] Behnud [not care about that], he
    didn t care about anything, and was constantly calling to God. He had a
    yellow prayer book. He was very shy and quiet, and everyone liked him very
    much. After Mr. Shoja i s death sentence was announced on September 26,
    2006, news media inside Iran, civil society activists, athletes, famous
    movie stars, and even [the city of] Kerman Mosque s board of trustees,
    made numerous efforts to stop [the implementation of] the sentence and to
    raise public awareness of it. Journalists and civil society activists also
    issued bulletins and declarations to stay the execution, pointing to Mr.
    Shoja i s young age at the time of the fight, and asking the authorities
    to stop his death sentence. Because of the defendant s young age, this
    case attracted public opinion outside the country as well. In May-June
    2008, the European Union issued a declaration against the pronouncement of
    death sentences for defendants who were under the legal age of 18 at the
    time of the commission of the crime, accusing Iran of breaching its
    international obligations, and demanding the revocation of Mr. Shoja i s
    death sentence. Furthermore, the United Nations High Commissioner for
    Human Rights cautioned Iran that, in accordance with the Convention on the
    Rights of the Child, issuance of a death sentence is prohibited for
    defendants who were under the age of 18 when they committed the crime.
    Amnesty International also issued a bulletin condemning Mr. Shoja i s
    death sentence. Arrest and detention Subsequent to the fight that occurred
    on August 18, 2005 in Vanak Park, Behnud s father turned him in to
    judicial authorities in order [for them] to investigate the fight and for
    justice to be carried out. (Oliae ifard interview with Rooz Online). The
    date of his arrest is not known. He was 17 at the time and spent nearly 10
    months at Kanun-e Eslah va Tarbiat-e Tehran ( Tehran Correction and
    Education Center ) until he reached 18, and was then transferred to
    Gohardasht Prison where he was incarcerated until the time the sentence
    was carried out. He spent four and a half years in jail after his arrest.
    According to his father, he had visitations and was allowed to talk to his
    family for 20 minutes from behind the glass window, and was allowed face
    to face visitation every 45 days. One of Mr. Shoja i s prison mates
    described the prison conditions as hell: The prisoner is facing the danger
    of contracting a multitude of illnesses including AIDS, drug addiction,
    and depression. Also, weaker kids are subjected to all kinds of
    harassments. Mr. Shoja i had also talked about awful prison conditions.
    (Behnud Shoja i Interview with Saba Vassefi). Trial Mr. Shoja i s first
    trial session took place on February 15, 2006 at Tehran Province Criminal
    Court, Branch 74, presided by the Branch s chief judge. The Prosecutor s
    representative and the victim s parents were also present. The Prosecutor
    s representative first read the indictment, and in closing, asked for the
    harshest punishment, given the next of kin s complaint and the Medical
    Examiner s opinion. Then the victim s parents asked that the defendant be
    hanged in public. Mr. Shoja i was then allowed to present his defense.
    Finally, at the end of the trial session, the presiding judge and the four
    other judges started consultations [among themselves]. (Iska News,
    February 15, 2006). Mr. Shoja i had an attorney. (Rooz Online, October 13,
    2009) Mr. Shoja i s last trial session took place on Tuesday, September
    26, 2006, again at Branch 74. The presiding judge was the same person. The
    Prosecutor s representative first described the indictment; the victim s
    parents still wanted the death penalty for their son s murderer. Behnud
    was also allowed to defend himself. Mr. Shoja i s attorney was also
    present at the session and presented a defense on his behalf. There were
    also two witnesses who gave testimony. At the end of the session, the
    judges started consultations. (Iska News, January 23, 2007). Since Mr.
    Shoja i was deprived of legal representation after the sentence was upheld
    at the Court of Appeals (his attorney resigned after the issuance and
    approval of the sentence at the Criminal Court), on August 1, 2008, he
    himself submitted a written request to the Province Criminal Court Branch
    74 for the implementation
