    The news of the execution of Mr. M. R. along with three other individuals
    was announced by the website ofKhabar-e Jonoub daily on March 5, 2009. The
    case of Mr. M. R., 28, pertains to the occurrence of two separate murders
    in 2004 and 2006 in the Khafr area of Fars Province. Arrest and Detention
    Mr. M. R. was prosecuted after the Police Criminal Investigation
    Department of Khafr had been informed of the occurrence of a murder on
    February 14, 2005. He was identified by the police during an investigation
    after the occurrence of another murder on August 8, 2006, and was
    arrested. Mr. M. R. was moved to the Khafr Police Criminal Investigation
    Department station for an initial investigation. However, there is no
    information available on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial
    Mr. M. R. was tried by Branch Five of the Public Court of Fars Province.
    Charges The court charged Mr. M. R. with two counts of murder. He was
    accused of fatally shooting a person with an AK-47 in the city of Khafr on
    February 14, 2005 and fatally shooting another person with an AK-47 on
    August 8, 2006. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt Mr. M. R. s confessions became the basis
    for the verdict that was issued against him. During the initial police
    investigation as well as the court proceedings, he accepted the charge of
    murdering the two victims. The expert opinion of the coroner on the cause
    of death of the two victims was among the pieces of evidence that were
    entered against Mr. M. R. The coroner declared the cause of death of the
    second victim to be internal hemorrhage. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense According to
    the available information, during the court proceedings Mr. M. R. did not
    give a statement about the murder of the first victim. Regarding the
    murder of the second victim he said he had heard that the victim had had
    an illicit affair with his sister, and that was why he would later shoot
    him. There is no more information available on Mr. M. R. s defense.
    Judgment Branch Five of the Public Court of Fars Province sentenced Mr. M.
    R. to death. Branch 41 of the Supreme Court approved the verdict. Mr. M.
    R. was hanged in Adelabad Prison, Shiraz on the morning of March 4, 2009.
