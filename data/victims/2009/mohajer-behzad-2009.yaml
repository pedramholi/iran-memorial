    Though not politically active, Mr. Mojaher went out among the election
    protestors that night. He called his sister from Azadi Square: lots of
    people; everything s calm. News of the death of Mr. Behzad Mohajer was
    published on the websites of Noruz and Ruz on August 3, 2009, Amirkabir on
    August 2 and 3, and Mojesabz Azadi on August 7, 2009. Additional
    information was received from the weblogs of his family members. Mr.
    Mohajer participated in the peaceful demonstration against the
    presidential election s results on June 15, 2009. His family had no news
    of him and there was no mention of him on the various official lists
    including the Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office, Evin Prison,
    or hospitals lists until his body was delivered to them. In an interview
    with Ruz on August 3, 2009, his sister, who last spoke with Mr. Mohajer,
    said: On June 15 at 9 in the evening, my brother called me and said that
    he was in Azadi Square and that a lot of people showed up, and everything
    was calm like the Tasu a Day in 1978. We had no news of him after this
    call. She continued: For several days we called his cell phone with no
    response. My brother and my son were going to the Revolutionary Court,
    Evin Prison, and Forensics everyday, hoping to see his name on their list.
    But there was no news of him until my sister and I were able to identify
    him in the Kahrizak Forensics on August 1. According to Ms. Mohajer,
    Behzad was shot in his chest and arm, his mouth was injured and his teeth
    were broken, and he had a large hole in his chest. In an interview with
    Radio Farda, Mr. Nima Namdari, Mr. Mohajer s nephew, said, We opened his
    case as a lost person in the Criminal Public Prosecutor s Office and,
    based on this, went to the forensic medical office twice, the second time
    about three weeks ago, and his picture was not there. But, suddenly, his
    picture appeared on the list of forensics. According to Mr. Namdari, on
    the forensics letter, it s stated that the body was taken to them on June
    21, before the time we went there. It means that the body was there and
    they did not inform us. After adding that the family doesn t know who
    delivered the body to the morgue, he added, When we went to receive the
    body for burial, some relatives, who were physicians, and I were present
    and saw the body. Hospital bandages and marks were still on the body that
    was kept in the morgue for 40 days. Therefore physicians who accompanied
    us concluded that Behzad had been in a hospital for several days before
    his death. He continued, There was a cross like cut on his chest probably
    due to autopsy. There was a bullet mark on his left side around his heart
    and also evident dark blue marks and skin injuries. But it was not
    apparent whether these marks occurred before or after death. About
    pursuing the case by Mr. Mohajer s family, Mr. Namdari said, We have
    opened a case at the Criminal Public Prosecutor s Office and demanded that
    his murderer be identified and prosecuted, and we will definitely follow
    up this request. Finally, he stated: As a family who have no special
    connection, we cannot do much politically; however, we will follow up the
    case legally. We hope there are justice and an independent judiciary in
    this country and the perpetrators are identified and prosecuted. Mr.
    Mohajer was single and had lost his parents. His brother and sister and
    their children mourn for his death. According to his sister, my brother
    was not indifferent about his society but he was not political or
    activist. According to his relatives, he was a happy, joyful, and kind
    person and everything was organized in his house. Mr. Mohajer s body was
    buried in section 208 of Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery on August 2, 2009. Based
    on the information available, Mr. Mohajer s brother-in-law, Mr. Ali Ashraf
    Namdari, was executed in the massacre of political prisoners at Tehran s
    Evin Prison in 1988. Background Election returns from Iran s June 12th,
    2009, presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with
    62.63 percent of the vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing
    these official results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging
    services were disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the
    election and remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st.
    On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any
    gathering of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country.
    The same evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing
    their presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fra
