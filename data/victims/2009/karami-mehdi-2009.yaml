    The Karamis lived in the northwest ofTehran, in a neighborhood called
    Jannat-Abad. The family lost him one evening, three days after the
    election, not far from home. News of the killing of Mr. Mehdi Karami was
    published on the websites of Iran BBB (July 23, 2009), the Human Rights
    Activists News Agency (July 28, 2009), the Association of Political
    Prisoners in Exile (July 5, 2009), and the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery s
    website. Mr. Karami was born on April 1, 1991, and lived in the
    Jannat-Abad neighborhood in northwest Tehran. According to the information
    available, he was shot and killed at the intersection of Jannat-Abad and
    Kashani Streets in Tehran on June 15, 2009, in the evening. His body was
    returned to the family on June 19 and buried at Behesht-e Zahra cemetery
    with intensive security control and only in the presence of his father
    (HRANA). The Karami family has been subjected to many threats and much
    intimidation from security forces (Iran BBB). According to the Association
    of Political Prisoners in Exile, the majority of victims families have
    faced various limitations by security forces on performing memorial and
    burial ceremonies. The government and official institutions have not taken
    action to prosecute those responsible for killing innocent protesters and
    have called the victims rioters. Mr. Karami was 18 years old. Background
    Election returns from Iran s June 12th, 2009, presidential election
    declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63 percent of the vote.
    Following the announcement, citizens disputing these official results
    demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging services were disrupted
    starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the election and remained
    unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st. On Election Day, the
    deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any gathering of
    presidential candidates supporters throughout the country. The same
    evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing their
    presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15 th , unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
    reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protesters took part in
    peaceful demonstrations in Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on
    June 19 th after Ayatollah Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced
    his support for Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were
    responsible for any disorder and its consequences. Amnesty International
    stated that the speech gave legitimacy to police brutality. The next day
    and thereafter, police and plainclothes paramilitary groups attacked the
    protesters. Public gatherings of any kind were declared illegal, and
    police, motorcycle-riding special units wearing black uniforms and
    helmets, and plainclothes agents brutally enforced this restriction.
    Individuals in civilian clothing, commonly referred to as plainclothes
    forces, are used in the Islamic Republic to disrupt political and trade
    union activities, student events and gatherings, electoral initiatives,
    and protests. Armed with sticks and clubs, and sometimes with chains,
    knives, batons, or firearms, they emerge when the state decides to
    suppress dissent. These plainclothes forces move about freely, violently
    beating protesters and arresting them, while the police passively look on
    or actively cooperate with them. There is little information on the
    command structure and organization of such groups, whose members wear
    ordinary clothing rather than official uniforms and may be affiliated with
    the minis
