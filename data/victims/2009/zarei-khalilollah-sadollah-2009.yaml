    News of the execution of Mr. Khalilollah Zare i, also known as Sa adollah,
    child of Nur Mohammad, and his co-defendants was published by numerous
    sources, including Fars News Agency (March 3, 2009), Kayhan newspaper
    (March 4, 2009), Iranian Students News Organization - ISNA (March 3,
    2009), the Sunni news outlet Sunni Online (March 5, 2009), and Taftan News
    Agency (May 29, 2009). Additional information about this case was obtained
    from the BBC Persian website (May 29, 2009), and an interview conducted by
    the Boroumand Center (Boroumand Center interview) with one of Mr.
    Khalilollah Zare i s co-defendants relatives. Baluchestan Popular Movement
    (Jondollah) issued a statement following the execution of Mr. Zare i and
    his co-defendants claiming responsibility for the suicide attack on
    Bassiji ceremonies being held at Imam Ali Hosseinieh on May 27, 2009,
    which led to the killing of 25 individuals, and declared it a retaliatory
    operation meant to avenge the blood of Mr. Zare i and three other Sunni
    clerics in Sistan and Baluchestan Province as well as the blood of more
    than 1,000 Baluch youth executed in that Iranian year. (Taftan, May 29,
    2009). Arrest and detention On June 16, 2008, at 2 PM, the city of
    Iranshahr s Information Administration forces arrested Mr. Zare i and
    several other individuals at his home in Iranshahr s Mohammadabad village,
    without showing an arrest warrant. Security forces beat and arrested Mr.
    Zare i, who was hosting several of his co-defendants at home, and took him
    to the Iranshahr Information Administration Detention Center where he was
    kept for two days (Boroumand Center Interview). According to a person with
    knowledge of the case, at the time of the arrest, Information agents
    severely beat Mr. Zare i in front of his wife and children for objecting
    to the beating of his guests, and picked him up and carried him away
    unconscious (Boroumand Center Interview). Mr. Zare i subsequently spent
    four months in solitary confinement cells at Zahedan s Information
    Administration Detention Center, and was then transferred to Zahedan
    Central Prison s Ward 3, known as the political prisoners ward, where he
    was kept for five months (Boroumand Center Interview). According to
    another published report, Mr. Zare i was arrested along with a group of 27
    individuals in the course of skirmishes with the Police Force, the
    Revolutionary Guards Corps, and the Bassij, in May-June 2008 (Kayhan,
    March 4, 2009). Trial A Branch Court in Iranshar tried Mr. Zare i and 27
    other co-defendants (Kayhan, March 4, 2009). There is no precise
    information regarding the court session/s. Charges The Court brought mass
    charges against Mr. Zare i and his co-defendants, charging them with
    support, membership, and making effective financial and military efforts
    to advance the causes of the Abdolmalek Rigi terrorist group in order to
    combat the Islamic Republic of Iran; gathering a considerable number of
    weapons, ammunition, and explosive materials and instruments; exploding a
    bomb on the police patrol s path; participation in the failed
    assassination attempt on the life of a Sunni citizen; and attacking the
    Road Police car in the town of Iranshahr . No information is available,
    however, about charges brought against them individually (Fars News
    Agency, March 3, 2009). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    allude to reports according to which, in certain cases, the Islamic
    Republic of Iran s officials bring false charges against their opponents
    (including political, civil, and union activists, as well as ethnic and
    religious minorities) such as drug trafficking or commission of public or
    sexual crimes, and execute them along with other regular criminals.
    Hundreds of people are sentenced to death in Iran every year; however, the
    number of those who are sentenced to death based on these false charges is
    not known. Evidence of guilt Based on available information, Mr. Zare i s
    TV confession and that of another defendant in the case, which were
    broadcast on the Sistan and Baluchestan center provincial television
    network, were among the evidence presented against him in court (Sunni
    Online, March 5, 2009). The details of the evidence presented against him
    in court are not available. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Zare i s defense. A Summary of the Defects in Mr. Khalilollah Zare i s
    Judicial Proceedings Based on available information regarding this case
    (such as the Boroumand Center s interview with a person with knowledge
    thereof) Mr. Zare i was severely tortured at the time of his arrest and
