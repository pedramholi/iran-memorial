    The execution of Mr. A. V. , along with another person, was reported by
    Khabar-e-Jonoub Newspaper Website, on October 8, 2009. According to
    available information, his case was related to the murder of a gold
    merchant in Khorram Bid, Fars, during armed robbery at his store, in 2005.
    Arrest and detention Mr. A. V. was arrested following an incident of armed
    robbery at a jewelry store, which resulted in the 44-year-old merchant s
    death. The police force of Khorram Bid investigated this crime, which
    occurred on March 13, 2005. There is no detailed information on the
    circumstances of Mr. A. V.s arrest and detention. He spent five years in
    prison, starting in 2005. Trial Section 5 of the Criminal Court of Fars
    Province, tried Mr. A. V. The trial took place with the family of the
    victim and the District Attorney in attendance. No information is
    available on Mr. A. V.s trial. Charges Section 5 of the Criminal Court of
    Fars Province accused Mr. A. V. of murder in the first degree . He was
    accused of armed robbery at a jewelry store in Khorram Bid, assaulting the
    owner, shooting him, and fleeing the scene. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to available information,
    the main evidence against Mr. A. V. was his own confession. During the
    preliminary police investigation, he confessed to the killing of Mr. Gh.N.
    . He also confessed to stealing cash and gold from the jewelry store.
    Defense According to available information, Mr. A. V. only intended to rob
    the store. During this robbery, an altercation occurred with the store
    owner, and he was killed by gunfire. No information is available on his
    defense. Judgment Section 5 of the Criminal Court of Fars Province
    sentenced Mr. A. V. to death by hanging. This sentence was requested by
    the family of the victim and the District Attorney. The accused man s
    objection to the verdict was overturned, and his sentence was approved by
    the Supreme Court. The judge supervising the prison appealed to the family
    of the victim for clemency, but this appeal was not successful. Mr. A. V.
    was executed in the presence of the family of the victim, on the morning
    of October 7, 2009, in Adl Abad Prison, in Shiraz.
