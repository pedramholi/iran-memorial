    The news of the execution of Mr. D. K. along with three other individuals
    was announced by the websites ofKhabar-e Jonoub daily (March 12, 2009) and
    E temad daily (March 14, 2009). The case of Mr. D. K., 36, pertains to the
    murder of an individual during a group fight. According to the available
    information, Mr. D. K. s brother was a taxi driver who became involved in
    a fight with another taxi driver over who would give a passenger a ride in
    the taxi station of the Fathabad Village of Marvdasht in Fars Province.
    The murder victim with a few others started a fight against the brother of
    Mr. D. K., who was exiting the village, and beat him. Soon after, the
    Brother of Mr. D. K. went home and found a wooden rod and returned to
    confront those who had beaten him. This led to a renewed struggle during
    which the brother of Mr. D. K. was beaten again. Desperate, the beaten man
    informed his two brothers, including Mr. D. K., of the fight and the
    beating he had taken. In anger, Mr. D. K. and his two brothers left the
    house to confront the other group. That started the group fight of May 18,
    2004, which led to the death of one of those involved as a result of
    stabbing. Arrest and Detention After the Judiciary Police of Marvdasht
    were informed of a murder during a group fight in the Fathabad Village of
    Marvdasht on May 18, 2004, Mr. D. K., along with a few others including
    his two brothers, was arrested and moved to the Judiciary Police Station
    of Marvdasht. In the process of police investigation, Mr. D. K. was
    accused of murder. He spent four years in prison. Trial Mr. D. K. was
    tried by Branch 102 of the Public Court of Marvdasht. During the court
    proceedings, Mr. D. K. s brother who had initiated the fight with the
    victim, was also present as an eyewitness (Khabar-e Jonoub daily, March
    12, 2009). Charges The court charged Mr. D. K. with premediated murder.
    Evidence of Guilt According to the available information, the statements
    of the eyewitnesses and Mr. D. K. s own confessions became the basis for
    the verdict that was issued against him. During the initial police
    investigation as well during the court proceedings, Mr. D. K. accepted the
    charge of murder. In addition, the body of the victim and the statements
    of Mr. D. K. s brother at court were among the pieces of evidence that
    were entered against him. Defense According to the available information,
    during the court proceedings, Mr. D. K., while expressing regret for what
    had happened, stated that he had had no intention of killing the victim,
    and that he had gotten involved in the fight on behalf of his brother and
    had only defended himself during the fight. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Judgment Branch 102 of
    the Public Court of Marvdasht sentenced Mr. D. K. to death. Branch 27 of
    the Supreme Court approved the verdict. The court granted Mr. D. K. a
    one-week window before the sentence was carried out so that he could seek
    the forgiveness of the victim s first-degree blood relatives. However, his
    attempts in that regard eventually proved fruitless. Mr. D. K. was hanged
    in Adelabad Prison in Shiraz on the morning of March 11, 2009.
