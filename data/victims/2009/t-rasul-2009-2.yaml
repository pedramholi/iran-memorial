    The news of Mr. Rasul T. s execution, along with two other persons, was
    published by Keyhan newspaper (November 18, 2009) and Nesfe Jahan
    newspaper (November 19, 2009). According to available information, Mr.
    Rasul T. s case was related to drug offences. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Rasul T. s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    The Revolutionary Court of Isfahan tried Mr. Rasul T. No information is
    available on her trial. Charges Mr. Rasul T. was charged with drug
    trafficking . He was accused of assisting in the purchase of 2 kg of
    opium. There is no detailed information about his charges. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Rasul T. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Rasul T. s defense. Judgment Isfahan
    Revolutionary Court sentenced Mr. Rasul T. to execution. According to
    available information, Mr. Rasul T. had twice requested pardon and
    mitigation of her punishment from execution to life in prison, but his
    requests were rejected by the Amnesty and Forgiveness Commission of
    Isfahan province (Nesfe Jahan newspaper, November 19, 2009). His sentence
    was upheld by the Supreme Court. On Monday morning, November 16, 2009, Mr.
    Rasul T. was hanged in Isfahan Central Prison.
