    The news of the execution of an unknown individual along with three others
    was announced by the website of Irankhabar News Agency on January 5, 2009.
    According to the available information, this unknown individual s case
    pertains to a bank robbery in Bandar Abbas in 2006. Arrest and Detention
    There is no information available on the details of this unknown
    individual s arrest and detention. Trial There is no information available
    on the session or sessions of his trial. Charges This unknown individual
    and the other three defendants in this case were collectively charged with
    robbing a bank in Bandar Abbas as well as sedition and rape. Their initial
    charge was only bank robbery, but in the process of investigation sedition
    and rape were also added to their charges. However, there is no
    information available on the details of the specific charges brought
    against this unknown individual. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    There is no information available on the details of the evidence entered
    against this unknown individual. Defense There is no information available
    on the details of this unknown individual s defense. Judgment The court
    sentenced this unknown individual to death. This unknown individual along
    with three others was hanged in Bandar Abbas Central Prison on January 4,
    2009.
