    In the election aftermath, authorities turned to preserving calm and
    keeping weapons out of Kermanshah. Mr. Maqsudbeigi, a medical student, was
    taken in for unknown reasons. The information about Mr. Puya Maqsudbeigi
    was taken from the E temad newspaper (June 21, 2009; August 3, 2009), the
    Change for Equality s website (August 1, 2009), Rooz (August 3, 2009), the
    Green Path Movement (August 10, 2009), the Committee of Human Rights
    Reporters website (September 4, 2009), the Green Innocent Martyrs website,
    and the website of the League for the Defence of Human Rights in Iran. Mr.
    Maqsudbeigi was a senior student at the School of Medicine in Kermanshah.
    Based on information available, Mr. Maqsudbeigi was arrested by security
    forces on Saturday June 20, 2009 and was taken to Kermanshah prison where
    he was tortured. He was released but died as a result of injuries suffered
    while in detention. The exact date of his death is not known. Officials
    Reaction On June 21, 2009, the E temad newspaper reported the director of
    the Ministry of Justice office in Kermanshah stating that 50 to 60 of
    those arrested in the post-election unrest, had been released. He
    described the atmosphere in Kermanshah province as calm and said the
    borders are patrolled to prevent the import of weapons. Local officials
    arrested Ms. Zahra Nozari, Mr. Maqsudbeigi s mother, on August 1, 2009 at
    10 p.m. as she held a one-person sit-in in front of the Ministry of
    Intelligence office in Kermanshah. The sit-in, which lasted only one day
    and ended with Ms. Nozari s arrest, was to protest the authorities failure
    to investigate her son s death. The Rooz correspondent reported that Ms.
    Nozari s friends and relatives are under pressure and have chosen to
    remain silent Many of the recent victims families are under pressure,
    hence the names of some victims are still unknown. Some families, forced
    to pay for bullets that caused their children s death, have been forced to
    state that they do not have grievance against Iranian security forces.
    Some family members were even forced to announce that Mir Hossein Musavi
    [a presidential candidate] is responsible for their children s death.
    Family Ms. Nozari, Mr. Maqsudbeigi s mother, protested officials failure
    to investigate her son s death. She covered her body with mud and held a
    one-person sit-in in front of the Ministry of Intelligence office in
    Kermanshah. She was arrested on the first day. She was held incommunicado
    for at least 9 days. Background Election returns from Iran s June 12th,
    2009, presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with
    62.63 percent of the vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing
    these official results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging
    services were disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the
    election and remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st.
    On Election Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any
    gathering of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country.
    The same evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing
    their presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
    reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protesters took part in
    peaceful demonstrations in Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on
    June 19thafter Ayatollah Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced
    his support for Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were
    responsible for any
