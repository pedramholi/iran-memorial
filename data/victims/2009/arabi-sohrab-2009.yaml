    Mr. A rabi had been missing from his family for 26 days. A dispute arose
    between his mother and some officers after pictures of Sohrab were torn
    from the hallway walls. Information about Mr. Sohrab A rabi, son of Parvin
    and Mohammad Reza and born on February 23, 1990, was gathered from his
    mother s interviews with Rooz Online (October 22, 2009; March 3, 2010).
    Mr. A rabi s death was announced on the following websites: Human Rights
    Activists News Agency (July 12 and 13, 2009, and December 23, 2009), Noruz
    website (July 12, 2009), AUTNews of Amirkabir University of Technology
    (July 12 and 31, 2009), the Committee of Human Rights Reporters (August
    20, 2009) Rooz Online (December 23, 2009), Gooya newsletter (December 22,
    2009), Radio Zamaneh (July 12, 2009), the International Campaign for Human
    Rights in Iran (June 4, 2010), and report of the Special Rapporteur on the
    situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran (March 03,
    2012). On June 15, 2009, Mr. A rabi participated in a peaceful
    demonstration protesting the result of the presidential election. He was
    shot and killed by a Basij agent near Azadi Square in Tehran. Mr. A rabi
    is one of the seven persons whose death has been confirmed by Iranian
    authorities in an incident that involved a Basij member shooting at
    protesters from the Basij building of Ashura, Battalion 117, located at
    the intersection of Azadi and Jenah streets. The A rabi family was unaware
    of Sohrab s whereabouts and condition until July 11, 2009, when state
    officials informed them of his death. Sohrab was 19 years old. On June 15,
    2009, a demonstration to protest the result of the presidential election
    took place in Tehran. Several people were killed or injured by
    paramilitary forces of the Basij as the demonstration came to an end and
    people began to disperse. The Basij forces of Ashura, Battalion 117,
    opened fire on protesters from the rooftop and through the windows of
    their building located at the beginning of the Mohammad Ali Jenah Highway
    on the north side of Azadi Square. Video clips of these shootings, posted
    on YouTube, showed tens of protesters in front of this Basij building
    chanting slogans. Direct clashes between people and Basij forces were not
    seen in these clips. However, the videos clearly showed the Basij members
    shooting at people from the rooftop and through the windows; and gunshot
    noises could be heard as well as scenes of civilians moving injured
    people. During an interview with the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation, an
    eyewitness present at the time of these shootings by Basij forces stated:
    The crowd was so huge that a large demonstration took place everywhere
    people went. Around 7:00 p.m., I walked north from Azadi Square towards
    the Ariashahr neighborhood. The crowd was chanting slogans We went far
    away from Azadi Square. The number of military forces on the streets
    wearing multi-colored clothes gradually increased. Black clothed agents
    were also present on the streets. There was a limited number of police. We
    walked for about 800 meters or a kilometer when I heard a noise. People
    said it was the sound of shooting. We turned around. It was not evident
    where the noise came from I heard the sound of a machine gun shooting a
    round of bullets and then heard single shots being fired. The crowd
    pointed towards one place. I saw a building that was crowded On the
    rooftop, Basij members were moving about, but it was not very clear what
    was going on. I turned back and saw a young boy who was shot in his side
    and was bleeding severely. This eyewitness emphasized that people nearby
    the Basij building were not armed. The exact number of victims in this
    incident is unknown. Mr. A rabi s death certificate reports that he died
    on June 15, soon after he was shot, but the Kahrizak coroner received his
    body on June 19. There is no information about where his body was from
    June 15 to June 19. According to HRANA, Mr. A rabi s body was taken from
    the coroner to the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery on July 12, where he was
    buried the following day. Hundreds of people reportedly participated in
    the burial ceremony to show their solidarity with the family. HRANA
    reported that armed forces were not present at the location; only
    plainclothes agents were seen. Police officers told the A rabi family to
    stop chanting slogans, and to end the ceremony quickly. On August 20,
    2009, a memorial service was held at the cemetery to mark the fortieth day
    after his death. Officials Reaction According to the HRANA report of July
    12, 2009, the judge in charge of Mr. A rabi s cases stated, Sohrab was
    shot and killed in the crowd that had gathered at the Azadi Square. He was
    one of the seven persons who died when a Basij member shot towards the
    crowd. How the officials found out about Mr. A rabi s death is unclear;
    however, what is known is that the officials did not inform Mr. A rabi s
    family of his death until July 11, 2009, despite the fact that his mother
    visited numerous state agencies in order to o
