    details were taken from the websites of Fars News Agency (July 21, 2009
    and July 12, 2010), Radio France Internationale (June 21, 2009), Iran News
    Agency (July 6, 2009), Ham-Mihan (July 7, 2009), Norooz (July 13, 2009),

    According to available information, Mr. Barvayeh was a 27-year-old native
    of Ahvaz. He completed his primary education in the village of Barvayeh,
    his high school education in Ahvaz, and later earned a bachelor's degree
    in drama and dramatic literature in Arak. He pursued a master's degree in
    dramatic literature at the Faculty of Art and Architecture in Tehran. He
    was a determined and hardworking student who had prepared extensively for
    the entrance exam. He was engaged to a woman named Neda and had told
    friends that he planned to build a house for her in Tehran when she
    finished her studies. His friends described him as passionate about poetry
    and literature and as a gifted writer. He regularly wrote articles and
    reports on the theater for various newspapers. Those who knew him
    personally described him as "a warm-hearted and kind Southerner, incapable
    of malice." (Ham-Mihan, July 7, 2009) Photographs show Mr. Barvayeh
    wearing a green wristband, a symbol of support in 2009 for presidential
    candidate Mir Hossein Musavi. One of his friends described him as a
    staunch supporter of Musavi and said that he participated in protests both
    before and after the election. The same person also noted that Mr.

    candidate Dr. Mo'in during the 2005 election. (Iran News Agency) 2009
    Election - Background Election returns from Iran s June 12 th , 2009,
    presidential election declared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 62.63
    percent of the vote. Following the announcement, citizens disputing these
    official results demonstrated in the streets. Text messaging services were
    disrupted starting at 11:00 p.m. on the night before the election and
    remained unavailable for nearly three weeks, until July 1st. On Election
    Day, the deputy chief of Iranian police announced a ban on any gathering
    of presidential candidates supporters throughout the country. The same
    evening, security forces made a show of strength, increasing their
    presence in Tehran s public squares to reinforce security at polling
    stations. Officials at election headquarters began reporting results soon
    after midnight, despite a statement from the Minister of the Interior that
    the first returns would not be announced until after the morning prayer
    (around 4:00 a.m.). Many supporters of other presidential candidates came
    out into the streets on June 13th, once the results were made public, to
    protest what they believed to be a fraudulent election. Candidates Mir
    Hossein Musavi, Mehdi Karubi, and Mohsen Reza i, Ahmadinejad s competitors
    in the race, contested the election, alleging many instances of fraud.
    They filed complaints with the Council of Guardians, the constitutional
    body charged with vetting candidates before elections take place and
    approving the results afterwards, requesting an annulment and calling for
    a new election. Before the Council of Guardians could review their claims,
    however, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, congratulated Ahmadinejad
    on his re-election. In the meantime, many people active in Karubi s and
    Musavi s campaigns were arrested. On June 15th, unprecedented
    demonstrations filled the streets of central Tehran, in which an estimated
    three million protestors participated, according to statements attributed
    to the mayor of Tehran. As the demonstrations were ending, paramilitary
    forces attacked the marchers, injuring and killing several people. To
    prevent such news from being broadcast, the Iranian government expelled
    foreign journalists from the country and banned news agencies from
    reporting on the events. Over the next three days, protesters took part in
    peaceful demonstrations in Tehran. The repression entered a new phase on
    June 19th after Ayatollah Khamenei s Friday sermon, in which he announced
    his support for Ahmadinejad and warned protestors that they were
    responsible for any disorder and its consequences . Amnesty International
    stated that the speech gave leg
