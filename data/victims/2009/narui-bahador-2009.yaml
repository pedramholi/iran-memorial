    The execution of Mr. Bahador Naru i, along with another person, was
    reported by many news sources, including Sistan and Baluchestan ISNA News
    Website, ISCA News, Radio Baluchi, and Aftab Newspaper (January 3, 2009).
    According to available information, Mr. Naru i s case was related to armed
    robbery and drug. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Naru i s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Naru i were waging war
    on God and spreading corruption on Earth . The way he did this was armed
    robbery, disturbing people s security, importing 300 grams of drugs and
    addiction to crystal meth . The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence providedagainst the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Naru i s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Naru i
    to death by hanging. The Supreme Court approved this verdict (Aftab News
    Website). Mr. Naru i was executed, along with another person, on the
    morning of January 3, 2009, in the Central Prison of Zahedan.
