    He was young, outraged, and fearless. His solidarity with fellow
    protesters was punished gruesomely. Information about Mr. Amir Arshad
    Tajmir was taken from a Roozonline s interview with his mother (7 Dec,
    2011) and the websites of IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) on December
    27 and 29, 2009, ISNA (Iranian Students News Agency) on December 30, 2009,

    on January 3, 2010, and several video clips posted on YouTube. In the
    first news reports, His name was published incorrectly as Amir Arshadi.
    Mr. Tajmir was a radio sound technician and son of Ms. Shahin Mahinfar, a
    radio and television anchorwoman. According to his mother, Mr. Tajmir was
    a true patriote and participated in the protests with full knowledge of
    the risks involved. Mr. Tajmir Left his house on December 27, 2009 to
    participate in that day s protest. He was hit by a police vehicle, when
    police vehicles attacked the crowd in Vali asr Square. He died soon after
    being transferred to a hospital. Video clips of car running him over
    several times were posted on the web soon after. According to his mother,
    Mr. Tajmir was attacked by government forces when he tried to help two
    protesters: They were beating up very badly two girls. One of them came to
    the cemetery and told me what happened [that day] they were beating us,
    she said, and people were booing [the security forces]. Amir Arshad had
    screamed and said booing is not going to help. Save them. Then he had
    walked towards the security forces and pushed one of the agents. Then
    people had joined him to help and save [the girls]. Then the security
    forces attacked the crowd. I don t know how badly he was beaten, but a
    security forces car hit him from the back with speed and threw him on the
    ground. Then another security forces car, which was parked there, ran over
    him three times. (Rooz Online) Mr. Amir Arshad s body was transferred to
    the Kahrizak coroner. He was buried in Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in Tehran
    in section 302, row 166, number 7. He was 25 years old. Officials Reaction
    Although authorities knew the identity of Mr. Tajmir, they did not inform
    his family. They asked the family to go to the Kahrizak coroner to recover
    the body on January 2, 2010, at 3 p. m. They ordered the family not to
    publicize his death and to perform the funeral in an orderly way, with the
    participation of relatives only. The burial place was selected by
    authorities and the family was not allowed to choose where their son will
    be burried. According to Ayandeh News, authorities had tried very hard (by
    using white coloring) to hide the severe injuries on his face. According
    to the existing information, on burial day, three official vehicles and
    many agents accompanied the mourners. During the burial, security agents
    were heavily present taking pictures and videos of those who participated
    in the ceremony. Female agents present among the mourners insulted and
    humiliated a young woman relative whose head scarf had slid. Agents also
    arrested a young man who took pictures during the ceremony and released
    him after questioning and taking the memory card from his camera. (Peyke
    Iran) Family According to the existing information, in order to recover
    their loved one s body, the family of Mr. Tajmir kept approaching
    authorities without any result for a week. The ceremony took place on
    January 2, 2010 with the presence of security agents, when all departments
    of the cemetery, including the office and mortuary, were closed and the
    surrounding area was deserted. After the body was washed, plainclothes
    agents accompanied the body outside. Then, the grave was covered and
    filled quickly and authorities ordered people to leave immediately without
    giving them a chance to mourn. With regards to filing a complaint with
    relevant authorities, Ms. Mahinfar told Roozonline in an interview two
    years after her son s death: they are criticizing me for not filing a
    complaint. To whom should I complain? So many people did file complaints,
    but what did they get? Who can I go to to seek justice? Who would
    understand that I worked day and night for 25 years so that Amir Arshad
    lives? I am ashamed that there are people who live in our country who can
    run over a 25-year young man three times and crush him, solely for the
    crime of loving his fellow human beings; And there is such dearth of honor
    that they are able to say, this [accident] was staged. Background
    Following the presidential election of June 2009 and the widespread
    protest against its result, the government tried to prevent demonstrations
    by labeling them illegal and by violently suppressing demonstrators.
