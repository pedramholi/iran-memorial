    Farzad Ansarifar, a construction worker who was shot from behind and
    killed. Information regarding the arbitrary execution of Mr. Farzad
    Ansarifar, son of Mr. Amin Ansarifar and Ms. Maryam Behtaripur, was
    obtained from an ABC interview with an informed person (March 4, 2021).
    Additional information was gathered from the IranWire website (November
    30, 2019; October 23, 2022), Radio Farda (December 4, 2019), the Human
    Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) (December 24, 2019), Human Rights
    Monitoring (February 24, 2022), and Radio Zamaneh (August 2, 2022). Mr.
    Farzad Ansarifar was born on February 27, 1992, in Behbahan, Khuzestan
    Province. His family comes from a lower economic background and has faced
    financial hardship. He attended high school up until his second year but
    then left to work and support his family. He was single and grew up in a
    warm, cheerful household where, despite financial struggles, strong family
    bonds and affection prevailed (ABC interview, March 4, 2021). Initially,
    Mr. Ansarifar worked alongside his father, and later he became
    self-employed in the construction industry, specializing in tile and
    mosaic work. Those who knew him described him as healthy, humble, and
    moral. He was interested in sports and regularly went to the gym. He also
    loved music. He was the fourth child in his family and lived with them in
    Behbahan, Khuzestan Province. (ABC interview, March 4, 2021). Mr.
    Ansarifar's arbitrary execution was related to the nationwide protests
    that erupted in November 2019 in response to the government s sudden
    increase in fuel prices. Background on the November 2019 protests Just
    before midnight on November 14, 2019, the Iranian government announced a
    sharp increase in the price of gasoline (50% for subsidized gas and 200%
    for unsubsidized gas). The announcement led to countrywide protests
    starting on November 15. Based on available reports and video footage,
    non-violent protesters gathered in public places, blocked some roads and
    created traffic jams while chanting anti-government slogans on November 15
    and 16. They called on fellow citizens to turn off their cars or chanted
    anti-regime slogans* in scores of cities and localities. By the evening of
    November 16, banks were reportedly set on fire in some areas and shooting
    was heard in some videos. The same evening, Iran imposed a countrywide
    information blackout by cutting off citizens access to the world web for
    at least ten days, undermining protesters ability to organize or to report
    on the state s brutal response to their protest.** Iranian authorities
    response to unarmed protesters was swift, disproportionate, and deadly.
    Accusatory statements of the Islamic Republic s leaders as early as
    November 16 indicated their lack of tolerance for citizens public
    expression of grievances. Protesters were accused of evildoing and having
    links to forces outside the country and were warned of harsh punishment
    for damaging properties. The first casualty was reported on November 15.
    On the second day of the protests, casualties increased with deadly
    shootings by the security forces in several cities. In videos sent from
    Iran, security forces can be seen using firearms and aiming at protesters
    in circumstances that do not appear to be life threatening. Plainclothes
    militias can also be seen beating and arresting protesters. In some cases,
    protesters blocked roads or gathered in front of police stations and
    government buildings, or chased security forces away with stones. Banks
    and other public structures in several provinces were burned, apparently
    by angry protesters, and security forces can be seen in videos damaging
    properties. The protest, which spread to scores of cities (120), roads and
    localities outside urban areas was quashed within a few days. At the time
    of this writing, The exact number of casualties remains unknown. In most
    cases, the authorities took dead and injured protesters away. In an effort
    to conceal the truth, authorities made families commit to silence in
    return for their loved ones bodies, forced some to bury them at night
    under security agent control, and asked others to pay various sums of
    money. On December 2, 2019, Amnesty International reported at least 208
    deaths. Many protesters were shot in the head and hundreds more were
    injured and many are not accounted for. Iran acknowledged the death of
    five members of the security forces. According to one parliamentarian, at
    least 7,000 were arrested during and in the aftermath of the protest. The
    lack of transparency on arrests, official reports about detainees
    self-incriminating confessions in the immediate aftermath of the protests,
    and reports from overcrowded prisons and detention centers raised serious
    concerns about the safety of detainees. Mr. Farzad Ansarifar s arbitrary
    execution According to available information, Farzad Ansarifar was shot
    and killed during protests in Behbahan, Khuzestan Province, on November
    16, 2019. (ABC interview, March 4, 2021). Clashes broke
