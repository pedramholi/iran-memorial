    Mr. Mansurnia was acutely aware of social problems surrounding him, and
    economic inequality bothered him greatly. He intended to start a
    specialized and modern veterinary clinic in his hometown of Marivan after
    his mandatory military service, and serve the people of the region and
    surrounding villages. Information regarding the killing of Mr. Borhan
    Mansurnia, son of Soraya and Rahim, was obtained through interviews
    conducted with a person who knew him on December 9, and 17, 2019, January
    25, 2020, and June 2, 2020 (ABC Interview). News of Mr. Mansurnia s murder
    was also published on the website of Human Rights Activists in Iran HRANA
    (December 3, 2019), Iran International (November 27, 2019), Radio Zamaneh
    (December 5, 2019), and Iran Wire (December 5, 2019). Additional
    information was obtained through a report by Radio Zamaneh (January 24,
    2020), Kurdistan Human Rights Campaign (January 27, 2020), Iran Human
    Rights Network (December 19, 2019, January 31, 202), Iran Human Rights
    Campaign (January 31, 2020), and Iran Human Rights Center (February 7, and
    19, 2020). Mr. Mansurnia was born on June 22, 1991, in the town of
    Marivan. He was single, an ethnic Kurd, and an ethical individual.
    Although his main interest lied in social science, he studied in the
    mathematics curriculum for a year on the insistence of [family and
    friends], and got his high school diploma in the science curriculum. He
    was accepted in the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program. In his spare
    time, he read sociology and psychology books and wanted to continue his
    studies and obtain a master s degree in psychology, once he had obtained
    his veterinary degree and performed his mandatory military service. Mr.
    Mansurnia defended his doctoral thesis in December 2018. (ABC Interview).
    Mr. Mansurnia read a lot and, in addition to short stories, he read books
    of astronomy. He also liked watching movies, especially European films. He
    liked mountain climbing and bicycle riding, and was into bodybuilding as
    well. He was also very good at computer games and had been ranked in
    certain regional competitions when he was in high school. (ABC Interview).
    Mr. Mansurnia had a small build and was made fun of at school by his peers
    because of that. In college, he showed a lot of interest in social issues,
    including economic inequality and the environment, and closely followed
    the news related to those issues and to events happening in his own
    surroundings. As part of his university curriculum, he worked at a clinic
    in Marivan during his last year of study; he would travel to the
    surrounding villages in order to understand the needs of the people of the
    region and to [eventually] establish a modern veterinary clinic in Marivan
    after his military service. He began his mandatory military service in
    February-March 2019, and was dispatched to [the city of] Kermanshah s
    Police Force s Police Emergencies Center 110 once he finished basic
    training. (ABC Interview). Background Right before midnight on November
    14, 2019, the Iranian government announced a sharp increase in the price
    of gasoline (a 50% increase for rationed gasoline, and a 200% increase for
    regular gasoline). Following the government s announcement, nationwide
    protests began on November 15. According to available reports and videos,
    the protesters gathered peacefully in public places on November 15 and 16,
    and caused very heavy traffic by blocking a number of streets. The
    protesters also chanted anti-governments slogans. Protesters across the
    country were asking their compatriots to turn their cars off and chant
    anti-regime slogans (1). According to reports, by the end of the day on
    November 16, banks had been set on fire in certain regions. Gunshots can
    be heard in some videos. That same night, the government blocked internet
    access in the entire country for at least ten days. Lack of access to
    information severely diminished the protesters ability to organize
    protests and report on the regime s brutal and ruthless clampdown of the
    demonstrators (2). The reaction of the Iranian authorities was swift,
    disproportionate, extreme, and deadly. From the very early days of the
    protests, that is, by November 16, the leaders of the Islamic Republic
    started to put the blame on the people in their public statements, and
    demonstrated that they would not tolerate any dissent or expression of
    discontent. The protesters were accused of being hoodlums and in contact
    with forces outside the country , and were warned that they would suffer
    grave punishment if they damaged public property. News of the first
    casualty was reported on November 15. On the second day of the protests,
    the number of the dead increased as police and security forces continued
    to open fire on the populace in several cities. In video footage received
    from Iran, police and security forces can be seen firing their weapons
    into the demonstrators in circumstances where it does not appear that
    their lives are in danger. Plainclothes forces can also be seen
