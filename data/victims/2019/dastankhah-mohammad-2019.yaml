    On his way home, Mohammad was shot dead near Molana Crossroad, across from
    the Basij Resistance Base in Sadra. A relative said he should have been in
    class at that hour. Information regarding the extrajudicial execution of
    Mohammad Dastankhah, son of Abdolreza and Narges, was obtained through an
    ABC interview with an informed individual close to the family on January
    21, 2020. Additional information for this case was gathered from reports
    by Amnesty International (March 2020), the International Campaign for
    Human Rights in Iran (December 10, 2019), the websites of Radio Zamaneh
    (December 7, 2019, and November 10, 2020), IranWire (December 10, 2019,
    and November 3, 2021), BBC Persian (November 14, 2020), Voice of America
    (VOA) Persian (November 13, 2020), Radio Farhang (December 31, 2019), the
    VOA Persian YouTube channel (November 10, 2021), and the Bloody Aban
    Facebook page (August 11, 2021), as well as documents preserved in the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s archives, including a court ruling (April
    20, 2020) and a burial permit (November 20, 2019). Mr. Mohammad Dastankhah
    was born on August 11, 2004, in Marvdasht, a city in Fars Province. He was
    the youngest of three children in a family of five, with an older brother
    and sister (Radio Zamaneh, December 7, 2019). According to available
    information, Mohammad was a third-year middle school student at Ferdowsi
    School in Shiraz. In an interview, his sister described him as a
    warmhearted, energetic teenager who "always wanted to grow up fast and
    start working." He had an incredible amount of energy and was full of
    life. He loved to work and was deeply interested in robotics. He kept
    wires and armature parts at home, spent hours playing with them, and made
    all kinds of things. He was often outside playing with his friends and
    gathering them around him." (Radio Zamaneh, November 10, 2020). His mother
    recalled that Mohammad was very close to her. He often helped with
    household chores and dreamed of going to university to study mechanics and
    become an inventor. He built boats, attended English classes, and loved
    creating new things" (IranWire, December 10, 2019; November 3, 2021).
    During his summer vacations, Mohammad attended robotics classes and
    constantly experimented and invented things at home, such as
    remote-controlled cars, boats, and helicopters. Although he was still a
    student, he had a strong desire to work. According to his mother, he
    distributed flyers in the neighborhood and often told her, "Mom, I want to
    work and earn so much money that I can fulfill all your wishes." She
    described him as a kind and outgoing boy who loved hosting family
    gatherings at their home (Radio Farhang, December 31, 2019). Both his
    mother and sister remembered him as a gentle and playful teenager who was
    well-known among his friends and passionate about football (Radio Zamaneh,
    November 10, 2020; Radio Farhang, December 31, 2019). Background on the
    November 2019 protests Just before midnight on November 14, 2019, the
    Iranian government announced a sharp increase in the price of gasoline
    (50% for subsidized gas and 200% for unsubsidized gas). The announcement
    led to countrywide protests starting on November 15. Based on available
    reports and video footage, non-violent protesters gathered in public
    places, blocked some roads and created traffic jams while chanting
    anti-government slogans on November 15 and 16. They called on fellow
    citizens to turn off their cars or chanted anti-regime slogans* in scores
    of cities and localities. By the evening of November 16, banks were
    reportedly set on fire in some areas and shooting was heard in some
    videos. The same evening, Iran imposed a countrywide information blackout
    by cutting off citizens access to the world web for at least ten days,
    undermining protesters ability to organize or to report on the state s
    brutal response to their protest.** Iranian authorities response to
    unarmed protesters was swift, disproportionate, and deadly. Accusatory
    statements of the Islamic Republic s leaders as early as November 16
    indicated their lack of tolerance for citizens public expression of
    grievances. Protesters were accused of evildoing and having links to
    forces outside the country and were warned of harsh punishment for
    damaging properties. The first casualty was reported on November 15. On
    the second day of the protests, casualties increased with deadly shootings
    by the security forces in several cities. In videos sent from Iran,
    security forces can be seen using firearms and aiming at protesters in
    circumstances that do not appear to be life threatening. Plainclothes
    militias can also be seen beating and arresting protesters. In some cases,
    protesters blocked roads or gathered in front of police stations and
    government buildings, or chased security forces away with stones. Banks
    and other public structures in several provinces were burned, apparently
    by angry protesters, and security forces can be seen in videos damaging
    properties. The prot
