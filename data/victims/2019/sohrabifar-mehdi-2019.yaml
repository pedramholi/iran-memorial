    Not turned 16 yet, at the time of arrest, he was not even literate enough
    to count as he had dropped out of school due to mental disability News of
    the executions of Mr. Mehdi Sohrabifar (Qarehcheh), child of Behjat and
    Ahmad, and one of his relatives, Seyed Amin Sedaqatpur, was obtained
    through an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with a
    person acquainted with Mr. Sohrabifar (June 18, and 28, and July 6, 2019).
    News of this execution was also published by Khabar Jonoob (April 27,
    2019), Amnesty International (April 29, 2019), Iran Human Rights
    Organization (April 28, 2019), and Rokna website (May 2, 2019). Additional
    information about this case was obtained through the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center s research, including correspondence with Amnesty International
    (April 29, 2019), Khabar Jonoob (July 30, 2017, April 18, and May 8,
    2019), Islamic Republic News Agency, IRNA (May 8, 2019), and Iran Human
    Rights Organization (April 30, and May 7, 2019). Mr. Sohrabifar was born
    on October 30, 2001, in the city of Shiraz. He was mentally disabled and
    was illiterate. He studied at a special school [for the mentally disabled]
    for less than a year, but ultimately, with his parents consent and in
    coordination with the school directors, did not continue because of his
    mental problems. (Iran Human Rights Organization, April 30, 2019;
    Boroumand Center interview, July 6, 2019). Mr. Sohrabifar loved life and
    had plans for his future. (Boroumand Center interview (June 28, 2019). Mr.
    Sohrabifar s case is related to burglary of several homes and sexual
    assault of a number of women in Shiraz Koushk Meydan [neighborhood] in
    2017, when he was only 16 years old. International law strictly prohibits
    the use of capital punishment in the case of individuals who were under
    the age of 18 at the time of the commission of the crime. As a signatory
    to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
    Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran is bound not to subject
    individuals who have committed a crime as children, to capital punishment.
    Arrest and detention At 6 o clock in the morning of a day in mid-June
    2017, Mr. Sohrabifar s father came face to face with Criminal
    Investigations Police officers as he was leaving his home. They showed an
    arrest warrant and entered the home in order to arrest Mr. Sohrabifar who
    was sleeping, and proceeded to take him to the Shiraz Criminal
    Investigations Bureau. On June 7, 2017, a woman contacted Criminal
    Investigations Police and informed them of a burglary and threats of
    sexual assault. As the investigation progressed, the police were apprised
    of complaints by 6 other women in May-June in Koushk Meydan, a working
    class neighborhood in Shiraz, and found out that some of them had been
    sexually assaulted. About two weeks later, Criminal Investigations
    officers were able to identify two burglars through facial composite
    sketches and other investigative [techniques] and were able to arrest them
    within a short time of each other. (Khabar Jonoob, April 18, and 27,
    2019). According to a person acquainted with Mr. Sohrabifar, this case had
    a third defendant. According to this person, Mr. Sohrabifar and his
    co-defendant were identified by this third defendant to the Criminal
    Investigations Police. (Boroumand Center interview, June 28, 2019). In
    another news piece, Khabar Jonoob newspaper announced the age of the other
    two defendants arrested as 16. (Khabar Jonoob, April 18, 2019). Documents
    published by Iran Human Rights Organization show, however, that Mr.
    Sohrabifar and his co-defendant had not yet turned 16 at the time of their
    arrest. (Iran Human Rights Organization, May 7, 2019). Mr. Sohrabifar was
    detained at the Shiraz Criminal Investigations Bureau for two months. His
    family was unable to contact him in that period. According to the person
    close to Mr. Sohrabifar, he had been tortured by electric shocks as well
    as other methods during his detention. (Iran Human Rights Organization,
    April 30, 2019, Boroumand Center interview, June 18, and 28, 2019). He was
    then transferred to the Shiraz Reform and Education Center and stayed
    there until April 2019. On April 24, 2019, Mr. Sohrabifar and his
    co-defendant were transferred to Shiraz Adelabad Prison (without knowing
    the reason for such transfer). He was able to meet with his family at the
    prison on that day. (Amnesty International). Trial Shiraz Criminal
    Prosecutor s Office, Investigating Judge Branch 17, opened the case
    against Mr. Sohrabifar. (Khabar Jonoob, July 30, 2017). Subsequently, the
    case was tried at Shiraz General Court. (Iran Human Rights Organization,
    April 30, 2018). He was represented by counsel at the trial. No further
    information is available about Mr. Sohrabifar s trial session(s). Charges
    Mr. Sohrabifar was charged with rape while committing theft . (Iran Human
    Rights Organization, April 30, 2019). He and his co-defendant were charged
    with 7 counts of burglary of homes and sexual assault of women . (K
