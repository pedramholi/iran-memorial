    I m someone s child, too. Don t let this moment pass us by. Let s rise and
    end this corrupt and criminal regime that has brought 40 years of misery
    upon the people of our beloved Iran. Information regarding the arbitrary
    execution of Puya Bakhtiari, son of Manuchehr and Nahid Shirpisheh, a
    27-year-old unmarried man, was gathered from several sources, including
    reports published on the websites of Radio Farda (November 28, 2019; May
    24, 2022), IranWire (November 28, 2019), Masih Alinejad's Twitter account
    (November 28, 2019), HRANA (December 24, 2019; July 5 and 11, 2023), Mehr
    News Agency (December 24, 2019), Ensaf News (December 26, 2019),
    Donya-e-Eqtesad (December 31, 2019), Zaytoun (January 25, 2020), and
    Mashregh News (July 11, 2023). Puya Bakhtiari was born on September 10,
    1992 in Karaj. He is the second child of his family. His father, Manuchehr
    Bakhtiari, is a disabled veteran of the Iran-Iraq war and his mother,
    Nahid Shirpisheh, was a primary school teacher. Mr. Bakhtiari had a degree
    in electrical engineering and ran a small family workshop. His mother
    described him as "a gentle soul with a deep love for nature," noting that
    he had become a vegetarian and was passionate about Iranian history and
    poetry. "Puya was critical of the political situation in Iran and had
    actively participated in protests even before November 2019," she said. In
    his diary, Mr. Bakhtiari wrote that 'belief in freedom and devotion to the
    people' were among the core values of his life." (IranWire, November 28,
    2019) Mr. Bakhtiari participated in the nationwide protests known as the
    November 2019 Uprising on November 16, 2019. Background on the November
    2019 protests Just before midnight on November 14, 2019, the Iranian
    government announced a sharp increase in the price of gasoline (50% for
    subsidized gas and 200% for unsubsidized gas). The announcement led to
    countrywide protests starting on November 15. Based on available reports
    and video footage, non-violent protesters gathered in public places,
    blocked some roads and created traffic jams while chanting anti-government
    slogans on November 15 and 16. They called on fellow citizens to turn off
    their cars or chanted anti-regime slogans* in scores of cities and
    localities. By the evening of November 16, banks were reportedly set on
    fire in some areas and shooting was heard in some videos. The same
    evening, Iran imposed a countrywide information blackout by cutting off
    citizens access to the world web for at least ten days, undermining
    protesters ability to organize or to report on the state s brutal response
    to their protest.** Iranian authorities response to unarmed protesters was
    swift, disproportionate, and deadly. Accusatory statements of the Islamic
    Republic s leaders as early as November 16 indicated their lack of
    tolerance for citizens public expression of grievances. Protesters were
    accused of evildoing and having links to forces outside the country and
    were warned of harsh punishment for damaging properties. The first
    casualty was reported on November 15. On the second day of the protests,
    casualties increased with deadly shootings by the security forces in
    several cities. In videos sent from Iran, security forces can be seen
    using firearms and aiming at protesters in circumstances that do not
    appear to be life threatening. Plainclothes militias can also be seen
    beating and arresting protesters. In some cases, protesters blocked roads
    or gathered in front of police stations and government buildings, or
    chased security forces away with stones. Banks and other public structures
    in several provinces were burned, apparently by angry protesters, and
    security forces can be seen in videos damaging properties. The protest,
    which spread to scores of cities (120), roads and localities outside urban
    areas was quashed within a few days. At the time of this writing, The
    exact number of casualties remains unknown. In most cases, the authorities
    took dead and injured protesters away. In an effort to conceal the truth,
    authorities made families commit to silence in return for their loved ones
    bodies, forced some to bury them at night under security agent control,
    and asked others to pay various sums of money. On December 2, 2019,
    Amnesty International reported at least 208 deaths. Many protesters were
    shot in the head and hundreds more were injured and many are not accounted
    for. Iran acknowledged the death of five members of the security forces.
    According to one parliamentarian, at least 7,000 were arrested during and
    in the aftermath of the protest. The lack of transparency on arrests,
    official reports about detainees self-incriminating confessions in the
    immediate aftermath of the protests, and reports from overcrowded prisons
    and detention centers raised serious concerns about the safety of
    detainees. Mr. Puya Bakhtiari s arbitrary execution According to available
    information, Puya Bakhtiari was fatally shot by security officials on
    November 16, 2019, on Rezvan Boulevard in Ph
