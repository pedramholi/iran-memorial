    Mrs. Sheikhi was outraged by security forces' shooting at protestors:
    "Shame on you why are you killing people's children? Information regarding
    the death of Ms. Mina (Dadeh Mina) Sheikhi, child of Nosrat and Mohammad
    Gharib, was obtained through interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center (ABC) with persons who knew her. (December 7, 2019, and
    July 15, 2020). Additional information about this murder was collected
    from the websites of Ensaf News (June 20, 2020); Khabar Online (June 8,
    2020); HRANA News Agency, the news arm of Human Rights Activists in Iran
    (December 3, 2019); IRNA, Islamic Republic News Agency (December 31,
    2019); Kurdistan Human Rights Network (December 5, and 27, 2019); Radio
    Zamaneh (December 9, 2019); and Ms. Sheikhi s death certificate issued by
    the town of Saqqez Personal Particulars Registry Organization (November
    21, 2019). Ms. Sheikhi was the second child of a well-known political
    family in the town of Saqqez. According to persons close to her, Mina was
    a joyful, exuberant, and sprightly woman and was the most courageous,
    fearless, and playful among people in her age group, and she had one
    particular feature that she lived with until the very end. She always had
    a smile on her face, and was kind and empathetic. (ABC interview). She had
    an elementary school education. After her mother s death, the
    responsibility of taking care of her brothers and sisters fell on Mina s
    shoulders. She got married in 1978-79. She had 4 sons and 2 daughters.
    After her husband died in an automobile accident in 1988-89, she raised
    them all by herself. She did not remarry after her husband s death. Ms.
    Sheikhi had no illnesses and was of completely sound mind and healthy
    intellect. She loved recreational activities, travelling, mountains,
    plains, and nature. She lived in Tehran because of her children s work
    conditions. Background Right before midnight on November 14, 2019, the
    Iranian government announced a sharp increase in the price of gasoline (a
    50% increase for rationed gasoline, and a 200% increase for regular
    gasoline). Following the government s announcement, nationwide protests
    began on November 15. According to available reports and videos, the
    protesters gathered peacefully in public places on November 15 and 16, and
    caused very heavy traffic by blocking a number of streets. The protesters
    also chanted anti-governments slogans. Protesters across the country were
    asking their compatriots to turn their cars off and chant anti-regime
    slogans (1). According to reports, by the end of the day on November 16,
    banks had been set on fire in certain regions. Gunshots can be heard in
    some videos. That same night, the government blocked internet access in
    the entire country for at least ten days. Lack of access to information
    severely diminished the protesters ability to organize protests and report
    on the regime s brutal and ruthless clampdown of the demonstrators (2).
    The reaction of the Iranian authorities was swift, disproportionate,
    extreme, and deadly. From the very early days of the protests, that is, by
    November 16, the leaders of the Islamic Republic started to put the blame
    on the people in their public statements, and demonstrated that they would
    not tolerate any dissent or expression of discontent. The protesters were
    accused of being hoodlums and in contact with forces outside the country ,
    and were warned that they would suffer grave punishment if they damaged
    public property. News of the first casualty was reported on November 15.
    On the second day of the protests, the number of the dead increased as
    police and security forces continued to open fire on the populace in
    several cities. In video footage received from Iran, police and security
    forces can be seen firing their weapons into the demonstrators in
    circumstances where it does not appear that their lives are in danger.
    Plainclothes forces can also be seen beating people with clubs and
    arresting them. In certain cases, demonstrators blocked roads or gathered
    in front of police precincts or other government buildings, or pushed
    police and security forces back by throwing rocks. In several provinces,
    banks and other public buildings were set ablaze, seemingly by angry
    protesters, and the police can be seen damaging public property in some
    videos. The protests, which had spread to dozens of towns (120), roads,
    and locations outside urban areas, were quashed within a few days. The
    then-Minister of the Interior implicitly declared the number of dead to
    have been between 200 and 250 people. According to him, about 40 or 45
    individuals, that is, approximately 20 percent of those killed, were
    killed with weapons that were not government issue. (Islamic Republic of
    Iran Broadcasting s Television Network One, May 31, 2020). The exact
    number of casualties is not clear at the time of this writing. In most
    cases, government agents took the dead and wounded protesters away. In an
    effort to hide the truth, these officials obtained written
