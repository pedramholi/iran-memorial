    Mehdi Salmanzadeh was only 14, yet quite concerned and fearless. Mehdi
    openly expressed his discontent with the government, even at school.
    Information about the extrajudicial execution of Mr. Mehdi Salmanzadeh,
    son of Reza and Nasrin, born in Tehran, was obtained from an interview
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with a knowledgeable person
    on August 16, 2023. Additional information was taken from Independent
    Farsi ( August 12, 2022), Voice of America (January 12, 2024), and Kayhan
    London (June 16, 2021). Based on the available information, Mr. Mehdi
    Salmanzadeh was an eighth-grade student and the second child in his
    family. Despite his young age, he was concerned and fearless. In 2017, he
    witnessed the arrest of his father at their home. (His father had been
    politically active since 2009, facing several arrests and had spent two
    years in prison due to his advocacy for democracy and secularism.)
    Following this incident, Mehdi openly expressed his discontent with the
    government, even at school. (Kayhan London June 16, 2021) Consequently, he
    actively participated in the November 2019 protests, particularly incensed
    by the deaths of protesters, including children. He talked about the
    November 2019 protests on his Instagram page, participated in the
    protests, and advocated for the children who lost their lives during those
    events. (ABC s interview on August 16, 2023) Mehdi's father speaks of him,
    stating, "During the November 2019 protests, Mehdi insisted on joining me.
    On November 17, 2019, I took him to the protests in Eslamshahr, where he
    chanted slogans and documented the events. He actively promoted the
    December 26, 2019 gathering (on the 40 th day of the passing of those who
    were killed during November 2019 protests) to encourage participation. He
    was particularly distressed by the deaths of Nikta Esfandani, a
    fourteen-year-old girl, and Mohsen Mohammadpur, a worker who was fatally
    beaten. These incidents deeply saddened him, leading to constant tears. He
    questioned, 'How can children like me impact the country's system? What
    changes can we make that they are killing children?'" (Kayhan London, June
    16, 2021) On December 26, 2019, he and his father had attended the
    40th-day memorial at Behesht-e Sakineh in Karaj, honoring those killed in
    November. The memorial event escalated into violence against participants,
    with the presence of numerous security officers. Mehdi was recording the
    scene with his mobile phone when one of the agents identified him, engaged
    in a confrontation with him, and smashed his mobile phone. (ABC s
    interview on August 16, 2023) Mehdi's relatives fondly recall him as a
    bright and cheerful teenager. Background on the November 2019 protests
    Just before midnight on November 14, 2019, the Iranian government
    announced a sharp increase in the price of gasoline (50% for subsidized
    gas and 200% for unsubsidized gas). The announcement led to countrywide
    protests starting on November 15. Based on available reports and video
    footage, non-violent protesters gathered in public places, blocked some
    roads and created traffic jams while chanting anti-government slogans on
    November 15 and 16. They called on fellow citizens to turn off their cars
    or chanted anti-regime slogans* in scores of cities and localities. By the
    evening of November 16, banks were reportedly set on fire in some areas
    and shooting was heard in some videos. The same evening, Iran imposed a
    countrywide information blackout by cutting off citizens access to the
    world web for at least ten days, undermining protesters ability to
    organize or to report on the state s brutal response to their protest.**
    Iranian authorities response to unarmed protesters was swift,
    disproportionate, and deadly. Accusatory statements of the Islamic
    Republic s leaders as early as November 16 indicated their lack of
    tolerance for citizens public expression of grievances. Protesters were
    accused of evildoing and having links to forces outside the country and
    were warned of harsh punishment for damaging properties. The first
    casualty was reported on November 15. On the second day of the protests,
    casualties increased with deadly shootings by the security forces in
    several cities. In videos sent from Iran, security forces can be seen
    using firearms and aiming at protesters in circumstances that do not
    appear to be life threatening. Plainclothes militias can also be seen
    beating and arresting protesters. In some cases, protesters blocked roads
    or gathered in front of police stations and government buildings, or
    chased security forces away with stones. Banks and other public structures
    in several provinces were burned, apparently by angry protesters, and
    security forces can be seen in videos damaging properties. The protest,
    which spread to scores of cities (120), roads and localities outside urban
    areas was quashed within a few days. At the time of this writing, The
    exact number of casualties remains unknown. In most cases, the authorities
