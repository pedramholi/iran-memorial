    News of Mr. Turaj Azizi (Aziz-zadeh s) execution was published on the IRNA
    (Islamic Republic News Agency) website and on the HRANA (Human Rights
    Activists in Iran News Agency) website, quoting the Nur County General and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor. Additional information regarding this case was
    gathered from the TAVANA Facebook page. Mr. Azizi was single, from the
    Chamestan District of Nur County in Mazandaran Province. His case is
    related to a murder in 2014 in the Chamestan village in Mazandaran
    Province. He was only 16 years old at the time of this murder.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment for those
    who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing a crime. As a party
    to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
    Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation not to
    impose capital punishment for an offence committed before the age of
    eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr. Azizi spent six years in Nur Prison.
    (HRANA). Nur County General and Revolutionary Prosecutor announced that
    Mr. Azizi had spent five years in prison. (IRNA). However, there is no
    information about the details of his arrest and detention. Trial A court
    in Nur County tried Mr. Azizi but there is no information about the trial
    session(s). Charges Mr. Azizi s charge was announced as murder . A source
    with knowledge of Mr. Azizi s murder charge said: Six years ago when he
    was 16, he had killed a 19 year old man in a fight. (HRANA). IRNA News
    Agency declared Mr. Azizi s age at the time of the crime as 18. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense Mr. Azizi was 16 years old at the time of the crime.
    Nur County General and Revolutionary Prosecutor has declared his age at
    the time of the crime as 18, which is in question by certain media
    (HRANA). No information is available about his defense. A Summary of the
    Defects of Mr. Turaj Azizi ss Legal Proceedings According to certain
    reports, Turaj Azizi was 16 years old at the time of the murder. Although
    the age of criminal responsibility in Iranian law is the age where an
    individual reaches puberty, and Mr. Azizi had reached puberty at the time
    of the murder, the change in the Islamic Penal Code in 2013, provides
    individuals under the age of 18 with the possibility of being exempt from
    the death penalty. Pursuant to Article 91 of said Law, In crimes requiring
    Hadd or Qesas, if the individuals under the age of 18 who have attained
    puberty cannot comprehend the nature of the crime or the prohibition
    thereof, or if there is doubt as to their mental development [and
    capacity] and maturity, they will be sentenced to the punishments
    prescribed in this chapter on a case by case basis. In order to ascertain
    mental development and maturity, the court may obtain the medical examiner
    s opinion, or utilize any other method it deems appropriate. In the
    present case, it appears that judicial authorities did not believe that
    Turaj Azizi was not mentally developed and mature at the time of the
    murder. Generally speaking, however, a 16-year-old individual can hardly
    understand the nature of his/her actions as would an adult. There is no
    unified procedure in Iranian courts to ascertain a person s mental
    development and maturity. What courts generally take into account is the
    defendant s conduct at the time of the murder and thereafter. Lack of a
    unified procedure, and not making proper use of specialized medical and
    psychological capabilities, has resulted in certain defendants under the
    age of 18 being found as lacking mental development and maturity in
    certain cases, and as mentally developed and mature in other similar
    cases, and therefore subject to the death penalty. It therefore appears
    that Article 91 is not applied to certain juvenile offenders in a
    methodical and well thought out manner. Furthermore, pursuant to Article
    37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Iran became a
    signatory in 1993, issuance of a death sentence for individuals who were
    under the age of 18 at the time of the commission of the crime is
    prohibited. Additionally, according to Article 6(5) of the International
    Covenant on Civil an
