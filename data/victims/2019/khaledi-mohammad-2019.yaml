    On the basis of available evidence and witness accounts, Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran (ABC) believes that Mr. Mohammad
    Khaledi was the subject of an arbitrary execution by agents of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran during the crackdown on protests occasioned by an
    increase in gas prices in November 2019. Given ABC s obligation to
    document the truth, ABC researchers are working to investigate and
    complete this case by obtaining new, documentable information, evaluating
    information obtained so far, and bringing to light further details
    regarding the course of events. If you have information regarding the case
    of Mr. Khaledi or have witnessed events in the area where he was killed,
    please help us complete this case by filling out an electronic form or
    contacting us by email , phone, or on social media. Background Just before
    midnight on November 14, 2019, the Iranian government announced a sharp
    increase in the price of gasoline (50% for subsidized gas and 200% for
    unsubsidized gas). The announcement led to countrywide protests starting
    on November 15. Based on available reports and video footage, non-violent
    protesters gathered in public places, blocked some roads and created
    traffic jams while chanting anti-government slogans on November 15 and 16.
    They called on fellow citizens to turn off their cars or chanted
    anti-regime slogans* in scores of cities and localities. By the evening of
    November 16, banks were reportedly set on fire in some areas and shooting
    was heard in some videos. The same evening, Iran imposed a countrywide
    information blackout by cutting off citizens access to the world web for
    at least ten days, undermining protesters ability to organize or to report
    on the state s brutal response to their protest.** Iranian authorities
    response to unarmed protesters was swift, disproportionate, and deadly.
    Accusatory statements of the Islamic Republic s leaders as early as
    November 16 indicated their lack of tolerance for citizens public
    expression of grievances. Protesters were accused of evildoing and having
    links to forces outside the country and were warned of harsh punishment
    for damaging properties. The first casualty was reported on November 15.
    On the second day of the protests, casualties increased with deadly
    shootings by the security forces in several cities. In videos sent from
    Iran, security forces can be seen using firearms and aiming at protesters
    in circumstances that do not appear to be life threatening. Plainclothes
    militias can also be seen beating and arresting protesters. In some cases,
    protesters blocked roads or gathered in front of police stations and
    government buildings, or chased security forces away with stones. Banks
    and other public structures in several provinces were burned, apparently
    by angry protesters, and security forces can be seen in videos damaging
    properties. The protest, which spread to scores of cities (120), roads and
    localities outside urban areas was quashed within a few days. At the time
    of this writing, The exact number of casualties remains unknown. In most
    cases, the authorities took dead and injured protesters away. In an effort
    to conceal the truth, authorities made families commit to silence in
    return for their loved ones bodies, forced some to bury them at night
    under security agent control, and asked others to pay various sums of
    money. On December 2, 2019, Amnesty International reported at least 208
    deaths. Many protesters were shot in the head and hundreds more were
    injured and many are not accounted for. Iran acknowledged the death of
    five members of the security forces. According to one parliamentarian, at
    least 7,000 were arrested during and in the aftermath of the protest. The
    lack of transparency on arrests, official reports about detainees
    self-incriminating confessions in the immediate aftermath of the protests,
    and reports from overcrowded prisons and detention centers raised serious
    concerns about the safety of detainees. Protest activity reached Mahshahr,
    Khuzestan - an Arab-majority coastal city in Iran s southwest, flanked by
    smaller settlements and reedbeds - by November 16, 2019. Protesters
    blockaded roads into the city as well as economically-important ports
    nearby.(1) In the first two days of protests in this region, no damage to
    banks or other property, nor clashes with state forces (reportedly limited
    to local law enforcement at the time), were reported.(2) On November 18,
    2019, however, a special-forces unit of the Revolutionary Guards moved
    against protesters with deadly force.(3) At the time of this writing,
    reliable data on the details of this event remain limited: security
    presence was heavy in this area, and the internet blackout lasted longer
    there than in other parts of the country. State officials first reported
    seeing armed protesters on November 18, though firearm ownership and its
    use during various ceremonies are common in the area. Based on credible
    reports, security forces initially fired non
