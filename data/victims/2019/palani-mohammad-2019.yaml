    Background Just before midnight on November 14, 2019, the Iranian
    government announced a sharp increase in the price of gasoline (50% for
    subsidized gas and 200% for unsubsidized gas). The announcement led to
    countrywide protests starting on November 15. Based on available reports
    and video footage, non-violent protesters gathered in public places,
    blocked some roads and created traffic jams while chanting anti-government
    slogans on November 15 and 16. They called on fellow citizens to turn off
    their cars or chanted anti-regime slogans* in scores of cities and
    localities. By the evening of November 16, banks were reportedly set on
    fire in some areas and shooting was heard in some videos. The same
    evening, Iran imposed a countrywide information blackout by cutting off
    citizens access to the world web for at least ten days, undermining
    protesters ability to organize or to report on the state s brutal response
    to their protest.** Iranian authorities response to unarmed protesters was
    swift, disproportionate, and deadly. Accusatory statements of the Islamic
    Republic s leaders as early as November 16 indicated their lack of
    tolerance for citizens public expression of grievances. Protesters were
    accused of evildoing and having links to forces outside the country and
    were warned of harsh punishment for damaging properties. The first
    casualty was reported on November 15. On the second day of the protests,
    casualties increased with deadly shootings by the security forces in
    several cities. In videos sent from Iran, security forces can be seen
    using firearms and aiming at protesters in circumstances that do not
    appear to be life threatening. Plainclothes militias can also be seen
    beating and arresting protesters. In some cases, protesters blocked roads
    or gathered in front of police stations and government buildings, or
    chased security forces away with stones. Banks and other public structures
    in several provinces were burned, apparently by angry protesters, and
    security forces can be seen in videos damaging properties. The protest,
    which spread to scores of cities (120), roads and localities outside urban
    areas was quashed within a few days. At the time of this writing, The
    exact number of casualties remains unknown. In most cases, the authorities
    took dead and injured protesters away. In an effort to conceal the truth,
    authorities made families commit to silence in return for their loved ones
    bodies, forced some to bury them at night under security agent control,
    and asked others to pay various sums of money. On December 2, 2019,
    Amnesty International reported at least 208 deaths. Many protesters were
    shot in the head and hundreds more were injured and many are not accounted
    for. Iran acknowledged the death of five members of the security forces.
    According to one parliamentarian, at least 7,000 were arrested during and
    in the aftermath of the protest. The lack of transparency on arrests,
    official reports about detainees self-incriminating confessions in the
    immediate aftermath of the protests, and reports from overcrowded prisons
    and detention centers raised serious concerns about the safety of
    detainees. --------------------------------------------------- * Slogans
    included: We are just tired, What a mistake we made with the revolution,
    Reza Shah, may your soul rest in peace, Death to the dictator, We will get
    our rights, we will not accept indignity, How long should the money of
    Iranians go to Gaza and Lebanon s pockets?, and We are people, not
    hooligans. Gas should be cheaper ** Internet access for homes was
    partially restored in most provinces (except in Khuzestan and Sistan and
    Baluchestan) but citizens had no access to the world web through mobile
    phones until early December 2019. Phone services and national Internet,
    which can be more easily controlled by the state, allowed communications
    throughout this period.
