    Information regarding the death of Mr. Kurosh Sheidani, son of Homay and
    Siamak, is obtained from Abdorrhman Boroumand Center interview with a
    person who knew him on January 13, 2020. (ABC interview) Additional
    information about this extrajudicial killing is taken from Amnesty
    International Website (May 20, 2020), Ensaf News (June 20, 2020), Khabar
    Online (June 08, 2020), Radio Zamaneh (June 02, 2020), ISNA (June 01,
    2020), the interview of IRIB News channel 1 with the Minister of Interior
    (May 31, 2020) and Mr. Sheidani s death certificate issued by National
    Organization for Civil Registration office in Karaj (November 22, 2019).
    Mr. Sheidani was 52 years old, married, and had two children. He used to
    live in Karaj and worked as an accountant. Background Right before
    midnight on November 14, 2019, the Iranian government announced a sharp
    increase in the price of gasoline (a 50% increase for rationed gasoline,
    and a 200% increase for regular gasoline). Following the government s
    announcement, nationwide protests began on November 15. According to
    available reports and videos, the protesters gathered peacefully in public
    places on November 15 and 16, and caused very heavy traffic by blocking a
    number of streets. The protesters also chanted anti-governments slogans.
    Protesters across the country were asking their compatriots to turn their
    cars off and chant anti-regime slogans (1). According to reports, by the
    end of the day on November 16, banks had been set on fire in certain
    regions. Gunshots can be heard in some videos. That same night, the
    government blocked internet access in the entire country for at least ten
    days. Lack of access to information severely diminished the protesters
    ability to organize protests and report on the regime s brutal and
    ruthless clampdown of the demonstrators (2). The reaction of the Iranian
    authorities was swift, disproportionate, extreme, and deadly. From the
    very early days of the protests, that is, by November 16, the leaders of
    the Islamic Republic started to put the blame on the people in their
    public statements, and demonstrated that they would not tolerate any
    dissent or expression of discontent. The protesters were accused of being
    hoodlums and in contact with forces outside the country , and were warned
    that they would suffer grave punishment if they damaged public property.
    News of the first casualty was reported on November 15. On the second day
    of the protests, the number of the dead increased as police and security
    forces continued to open fire on the populace in several cities. In video
    footage received from Iran, police and security forces can be seen firing
    their weapons into the demonstrators in circumstances where it does not
    appear that their lives are in danger. Plainclothes forces can also be
    seen beating people with clubs and arresting them. In certain cases,
    demonstrators blocked roads or gathered in front of police precincts or
    other government buildings, or pushed police and security forces back by
    throwing rocks. In several provinces, banks and other public buildings
    were set ablaze, seemingly by angry protesters, and the police can be seen
    damaging public property in some videos. The protests, which had spread to
    dozens of towns (120), roads, and locations outside urban areas, were
    quashed within a few days. The then-Minister of the Interior implicitly
    declared the number of dead to have been between 200 and 250 people.
    According to him, about 40 or 45 individuals, that is, approximately 20
    percent of those killed, were killed with weapons that were not government
    issue. (Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting s Television Network One,
    May 31, 2020). The exact number of casualties is not clear at the time of
    this writing. In most cases, government agents took the dead and wounded
    protesters away. In an effort to hide the truth, these officials obtained
    written pledges from the victims families that the would remain silent in
    return for the bodies of their loved ones, and even forced some of them to
    bury their dead at night under the veil of darkness, and under the control
    and watchful eye of security agents. Others were asked for various sums of
    money. In its latest report published on May 20, 2020, Amnesty
    International announced the number of dead to have been at least 304 (3).
    A large number of the demonstrators had been shot in the head and chest.
    Hundreds of others were wounded, and the fate of many is unknown. The
    Iranian government confirmed the death of 6 members of the police and
    security forces. On May 31, 2020, the Interior Minister declared the
    number of people killed in the November protests to have been between 200
    and 225, 20 percent of whom were shot by non-governmental bullets (4). On
    June 1, 2020, the Head of Majless ( Parliament ) National Security
    Commission declared the number of people killed in the protests against
    the increase in the price of gas to have been 230, including members of
    the police and security forces (5). Accord
