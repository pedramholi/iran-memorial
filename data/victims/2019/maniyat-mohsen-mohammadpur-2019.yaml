    Mr. Mohammadpur was a young 17-year-old ethnic Arab from the city of
    Khorramshahr. He went to school in the morning and worked as a mason in
    the afternoon in order to pay for his education and to help out his
    family. He was a happy and energetic person. Information regarding the
    killing of Mr. Mohsen Mohammadpur Maniat, son of Ali, was obtained from
    Amnesty International (May 20, 2020). The news of Mr. Mohammadpur s death
    was also published on Radio Farda website (December 2, 2019), Iran Azadi
    website (December 8, 2019), Moaleman Edalatkhah Telegram Channel (December
    18, 2019), Khakzadegan Telegram Channel (December 5, 2019), and Tavana
    Facebook Page (December 6, 2019). Additional information was obtained from
    Memar Twitter account (July 28, 2020), Kafe Aban website (June 8, 2020),
    Iran International Twitter account (December 23, 2019), Iran Kargar
    website (December 16, 2019), and Radio Zamaneh website (December 16,
    2019). Mr. Mohammadpur was an ethnic Arab [Iranian] citizen from the
    Maniat tribe, born on August 18, 2002 in the city of Khorramshahr. He was
    the second child of a five-member family. Mr. Mohammadpur was a student,
    but he worked as a mason to help out with his family. He would also
    collect and sell recyclable trash in order to pay for his own education.
    He was a happy and energetic person who loved soccer. (Kafe Aban website,
    Memar Twitter account). Background Right before midnight on November 14,
    2019, the Iranian government announced a sharp increase in the price of
    gasoline (a 50% increase for rationed gasoline, and a 200% increase for
    regular gasoline). Following the government s announcement, nationwide
    protests began on November 15. According to available reports and videos,
    the protesters gathered peacefully in public places on November 15 and 16,
    and caused very heavy traffic by blocking a number of streets. The
    protesters also chanted anti-governments slogans. Protesters across the
    country were asking their compatriots to turn their cars off and chant
    anti-regime slogans (1). According to reports, by the end of the day on
    November 16, banks had been set on fire in certain regions. Gunshots can
    be heard in some videos. That same night, the government blocked internet
    access in the entire country for at least ten days. Lack of access to
    information severely diminished the protesters ability to organize
    protests and report on the regime s brutal and ruthless clampdown of the
    demonstrators (2). The reaction of the Iranian authorities was swift,
    disproportionate, extreme, and deadly. From the very early days of the
    protests, that is, by November 16, the leaders of the Islamic Republic
    started to put the blame on the people in their public statements, and
    demonstrated that they would not tolerate any dissent or expression of
    discontent. The protesters were accused of being hoodlums and in contact
    with forces outside the country , and were warned that they would suffer
    grave punishment if they damaged public property. News of the first
    casualty was reported on November 15. On the second day of the protests,
    the number of the dead increased as police and security forces continued
    to open fire on the populace in several cities. In video footage received
    from Iran, police and security forces can be seen firing their weapons
    into the demonstrators in circumstances where it does not appear that
    their lives are in danger. Plainclothes forces can also be seen beating
    people with clubs and arresting them. In certain cases, demonstrators
    blocked roads or gathered in front of police precincts or other government
    buildings, or pushed police and security forces back by throwing rocks. In
    several provinces, banks and other public buildings were set ablaze,
    seemingly by angry protesters, and the police can be seen damaging public
    property in some videos. The protests, which had spread to dozens of towns
    (120), roads, and locations outside urban areas, were quashed within a few
    days. The exact number of casualties is not clear at the time of this
    writing. In most cases, government agents took the dead and wounded
    protesters away. In an effort to hide the truth, these officials obtained
    written pledges from the victims families that the would remain silent in
    return for the bodies of their loved ones, and even forced some of them to
    bury their dead at night under the veil of darkness, and under the control
    and watchful eye of security agents. Others were asked for various sums of
    money. In its latest report published on May 20, 2020, Amnesty
    International announced the number of dead to have been at least 304 (3).
    A large number of the demonstrators had been shot in the head and chest.
    Hundreds of others were wounded, and the fate of many is unknown. The
    Iranian government confirmed the death of 6 members of the police and
    security forces. On May 31, 2020, the Interior Minister declared the
    number of people killed in the November protests to have been between 200
    and 225, 20 percent of whom were shot by non-
