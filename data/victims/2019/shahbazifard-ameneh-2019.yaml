    Ms. Shahbazifard was shot from behind and killed as she was trying to help
    an injured young man during the protests, attempting to tie her scarf
    around his leg to stop the bleeding. Information regarding the arbitrary
    execution of 36-year-old Ameneh Shahbazifard, a married woman and daughter
    of Yunes Ali and Soraya, was obtained through an interview conducted by
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center (ABC) with her brother, Mohammad Mahdi
    Shahbazifard on August 19, 2022. The Additional information was gathered
    from IranWire (November 24, 2019), the Center for Human Rights in Iran
    (December 9, 2019), Radio Farda (November 18, 2021), and Radio Zamaneh
    (November 19, 2022). Ms. Shahbazifard was born on December 30, 1983, in
    the village of Varkeh Rud, near Qazvin. She graduated from high school,
    got married, and became a mother of three (two daughters and one son). She
    worked as a secretary and occasionally as a taxi driver for her brother's
    call-in taxi service. Her brother remembers her as a kind woman who always
    tried to help those around her (ABC interview). Ms. Shahbazifard was
    killed during nationwide protests against the significant increase in
    gasoline prices in November 2019. Background on the November 2019 protests
    Just before midnight on November 14, 2019, the Iranian government
    announced a sharp increase in the price of gasoline (50% for subsidized
    gas and 200% for unsubsidized gas). The announcement led to countrywide
    protests starting on November 15. Based on available reports and video
    footage, non-violent protesters gathered in public places, blocked some
    roads and created traffic jams while chanting anti-government slogans on
    November 15 and 16. They called on fellow citizens to turn off their cars
    or chanted anti-regime slogans* in scores of cities and localities. By the
    evening of November 16, banks were reportedly set on fire in some areas
    and shooting was heard in some videos. The same evening, Iran imposed a
    countrywide information blackout by cutting off citizens access to the
    world web for at least ten days, undermining protesters ability to
    organize or to report on the state s brutal response to their protest.**
    Iranian authorities response to unarmed protesters was swift,
    disproportionate, and deadly. Accusatory statements of the Islamic
    Republic s leaders as early as November 16 indicated their lack of
    tolerance for citizens public expression of grievances. Protesters were
    accused of evildoing and having links to forces outside the country and
    were warned of harsh punishment for damaging properties. The first
    casualty was reported on November 15. On the second day of the protests,
    casualties increased with deadly shootings by the security forces in
    several cities. In videos sent from Iran, security forces can be seen
    using firearms and aiming at protesters in circumstances that do not
    appear to be life threatening. Plainclothes militias can also be seen
    beating and arresting protesters. In some cases, protesters blocked roads
    or gathered in front of police stations and government buildings, or
    chased security forces away with stones. Banks and other public structures
    in several provinces were burned, apparently by angry protesters, and
    security forces can be seen in videos damaging properties. The protest,
    which spread to scores of cities (120), roads and localities outside urban
    areas was quashed within a few days. At the time of this writing, The
    exact number of casualties remains unknown. In most cases, the authorities
    took dead and injured protesters away. In an effort to conceal the truth,
    authorities made families commit to silence in return for their loved ones
    bodies, forced some to bury them at night under security agent control,
    and asked others to pay various sums of money. On December 2, 2019,
    Amnesty International reported at least 208 deaths. Many protesters were
    shot in the head and hundreds more were injured and many are not accounted
    for. Iran acknowledged the death of five members of the security forces.
    According to one parliamentarian, at least 7,000 were arrested during and
    in the aftermath of the protest. The lack of transparency on arrests,
    official reports about detainees self-incriminating confessions in the
    immediate aftermath of the protests, and reports from overcrowded prisons
    and detention centers raised serious concerns about the safety of
    detainees. Ms. Ameneh Shahbazifard s arbitrary execution According to
    available information, Ameneh Shahbazifard was fatally shot by security
    forces around 8 p.m. on Sunday, November 17, 2019, on Iran Zamin Street in
    the Sarasab neighborhood of Malard. She had gone out to purchase
    medication for her child on the second day of the November 2019 protests.
    On her way back, near her home, she saw a young man who had been shot in
    the leg. She approached to help him and removed her scarf to tie it around
    the wound. While tending to the injury, security forces shot her in the
    neck from behind and she died at the scene. (ABC intervie
