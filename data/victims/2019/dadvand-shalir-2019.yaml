    Ms. Dadvand was one of those who lost their lives during the nationwide
    protests in Bukan in November 2019. Information regarding the arbitrary
    execution of Ms. Shalir Dadvand, a resident of Amirabad neighborhood in
    Bukan, was gathered from Kurdpa (November 18, 2019) and the human rights
    news agency HRANA (December 10, 2019). Her arbitrary execution case
    relates to the November 2019 protests. Background on the November 2019
    protests Just before midnight on November 14, 2019, the Iranian government
    announced a sharp increase in the price of gasoline (50% for subsidized
    gas and 200% for unsubsidized gas). The announcement led to countrywide
    protests starting on November 15. Based on available reports and video
    footage, non-violent protesters gathered in public places, blocked some
    roads and created traffic jams while chanting anti-government slogans on
    November 15 and 16. They called on fellow citizens to turn off their cars
    or chanted anti-regime slogans* in scores of cities and localities. By the
    evening of November 16, banks were reportedly set on fire in some areas
    and shooting was heard in some videos. The same evening, Iran imposed a
    countrywide information blackout by cutting off citizens access to the
    world web for at least ten days, undermining protesters ability to
    organize or to report on the state s brutal response to their protest.**
    Iranian authorities response to unarmed protesters was swift,
    disproportionate, and deadly. Accusatory statements of the Islamic
    Republic s leaders as early as November 16 indicated their lack of
    tolerance for citizens public expression of grievances. Protesters were
    accused of evildoing and having links to forces outside the country and
    were warned of harsh punishment for damaging properties. The first
    casualty was reported on November 15. On the second day of the protests,
    casualties increased with deadly shootings by the security forces in
    several cities. In videos sent from Iran, security forces can be seen
    using firearms and aiming at protesters in circumstances that do not
    appear to be life threatening. Plainclothes militias can also be seen
    beating and arresting protesters. In some cases, protesters blocked roads
    or gathered in front of police stations and government buildings, or
    chased security forces away with stones. Banks and other public structures
    in several provinces were burned, apparently by angry protesters, and
    security forces can be seen in videos damaging properties. The protest,
    which spread to scores of cities (120), roads and localities outside urban
    areas was quashed within a few days. At the time of this writing, The
    exact number of casualties remains unknown. In most cases, the authorities
    took dead and injured protesters away. In an effort to conceal the truth,
    authorities made families commit to silence in return for their loved ones
    bodies, forced some to bury them at night under security agent control,
    and asked others to pay various sums of money. On December 2, 2019,
    Amnesty International reported at least 208 deaths. Many protesters were
    shot in the head and hundreds more were injured and many are not accounted
    for. Iran acknowledged the death of five members of the security forces.
    According to one parliamentarian, at least 7,000 were arrested during and
    in the aftermath of the protest. The lack of transparency on arrests,
    official reports about detainees self-incriminating confessions in the
    immediate aftermath of the protests, and reports from overcrowded prisons
    and detention centers raised serious concerns about the safety of
    detainees. Ms. Shalir Dadvand s arbitrary execution According to available
    information, security officials shot Ms. Dadvand directly during protests
    in Bukan on November 17, 2019, resulting in her death shortly afterward.
    Regulations on Controlling Protests There have been numerous reports of
    deaths during critical demonstrations in Iran. In many of these cases,
    armed forces have used firearms to suppress protests. Iranian law provides
    certain regulations regarding the use of firearms by armed forces during
    demonstrations. In addition, there are legal provisions in Iran for the
    punishment of officials who act unlawfully by firing weapons, as well as
    rules for the compensation of victims. This brief overview will review
    these provisions. The law allows armed forces officials to use firearms in
    certain situations, including to prevent riots and disorders. However, the
    law does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes riots and
    disorders. The Law on the Use of Firearms by the Armed Forces in Essential
    Cases, enacted in 1994, outlines specific conditions for the use of
    firearms. The main principle established by this law is that of necessity,
    meaning that armed forces officers may fire their weapons only in
    emergencies. Regarding protests, Articles 4 and 5 of this law allow
    officials to use their weapons under certain conditions to restore order
    and prevent riots. Article 4 states: "Police officers ar
