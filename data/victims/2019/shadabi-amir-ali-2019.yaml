    Does a 17-year-old juvenile even appreciate and comprehend the
    consequences of his/her actions like adults do? News of Mr. Amirali
    Shadabi s execution was obtained from an interview conducted by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with a person close to him (September 24,
    2019), and one of Mr. Shadabi s prison mates (July 12, 2019). News of this
    execution and that of two other individuals was also published on the Iran
    Human Rights Organization s website (July 19, 2019). Mr. Shadabi was
    single and had a seventh grade education. He was born and resided in the
    town of Minab in Hormozgan Province. According to his prison mates in
    Minab Prison, Mr. Shadabi was a courageous and intelligent boy . He did
    not lie. Everybody in prison liked him because he was young and a really
    great kid. (Boroumand Center interview with his ward mate). Mr. Shadabi s
    case is related to a murder committed in the town of Minab on November 13,
    2013. He was 17 years old at the time. International laws have strictly
    prohibited capital punishment for those who were under the age of 18 at
    the time of committing a crime. As a party to the International Covenant
    on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the
    Child, Iran has the obligation not to impose capital punishment for an
    offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Shadabi was arrested by the police on the morning of November 14, 2013,
    and taken to the Criminal Investigations Bureau based on a complaint
    lodged by a family who claimed he had murdered their son. Mr. Shadabi
    spent five years and six months in prison and was allowed visitations with
    his family. Trial Minab County Court tried Mr. Shadabi. He was represented
    by counsel. There are, however, no details regarding his trial session(s).
    Charges According to available information, in the course of a group
    altercation, Mr. Shadabi had stabbed an individual who was bigger and
    stronger than he was and had severely beaten him, thereby causing his
    death. Mr. Shadabi went to his sister s home after the incident and stayed
    in his own neighborhood. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence used against Mr. Shadabi was declared to have been the Defendant
    s confession, testimony of several eyewitnesses, the complaint of the
    murder victim s family, and the Medical Examiner s report . (Boroumand
    Center interview with his ward mate). International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Shadabi was
    17 years old at the time of the crime. Defending himself during
    interrogations conducted by the Criminal Investigations Bureau officers,
    he stated that he had not killed the victim and had stabbed him to defend
    himself. According to Mr. Shadabi, that man was very tall and was on top
    of me. He beat me a lot and I stabbed him to defend myself . (Boroumand
    Center interview with his ward mate). No other information is available
    about his or his attorney s statements in his defense. A Summary of the
    Defects of Mr. Amirali Shadabi s Legal Proceedings According to available
    information, Mr. Amirali Shadabi stated in his defense that the murder
    victim was a stronger individual than he was, and that he had acted in
    self-defense in using a knife to stab him. Although self-defense has its
    own specific requirements, and not any defense of the self can be
    considered legitimate [for the purpose of the application of the statute],
    the consequence of capital punishment having been designated as the
    punishment for murder, however, is that a defendant is either executed or
    not punished at all. In other words, in certain instances, it is possible
    that the defendant s action does not constitute self-defense but is
    [simply] a reaction to the victim s action, and that the defendant has no
    other choice in that moment but to take action. In such cases, it seems
    that the defendant should be entitled to a lesser punishment; he/she
    should not be punished in the same way as a person who had premeditated
    his/her actions and committed murder intentionally. In other wor
