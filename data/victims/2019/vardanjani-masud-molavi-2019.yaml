    Mr. Molavi, who worked with government and military institutions for about
    10 years as a consultant or director of data security, immigrated to
    Turkey in the spring of 2018. He then used to disseminate information
    related to senior government officials and institutions, from the Leader
    to Ministers, through social media networks. Information regarding the
    murder of Mr. Mas ud Molavi Vardanjani was obtained from the Turkish
    Police website (March 2020) and the Turkish daily newspaper Sabah s
    website (March 31, 2020). The news of this killing was also published on
    the Suzuko website (March 12, 2020). Additional information was obtained
    from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with a
    journalist with knowledge of the case (April 3, 2020), IRNA News Agency
    (November 25, 2019), Twitter and the BBC Persian website (March 28, 2020),
    Reuters (March 27, 2020), Black Box Telegram Channel (from its start on
    July 20, 2018, to November 14, 2019), and other sources.* Mr. Molavi, son
    of Kobra Karimi, was born on April 17, 1986, in [the town of] Najafabad in
    Esfahan [Province], and resided in Turkey starting in the spring of 2018.
    According to information attributed to Mr. Molavi published on LinkedIn,
    he held a master s degree in civil engineering and computer science. He
    was data security manager in a Chinese communications company for a while,
    and during the same time period, was director of planning and development,
    as well as network security adviser, to the Iranian State Radio and
    Television (Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, IRIB) for 3 years. He
    was subsequently deputy [director] of research and development for 5 years
    at the Support and Renovation of Iran s Helicopters Company affiliated
    with the State Aerospace Industries Organization, and at the same time,
    was among the high-ranking directors of the Cyber Defense Command in the
    Armed Forces General Headquarters for 7 years. (LinkedIn, Suzuko). Iranian
    media have referred to Mr. Molavi as the Islamic Azad University s Head of
    Advanced Technologies Research Center Parseh and designer of Artificial
    Intelligence with a new three-dimensional algorithm . The latter design
    can be used in drones and is connected to governmental and private
    institutions in Iran. Some sources have said that he had a degree in
    Artificial Intelligence. (Khorassan newspaper, Aftab Online, Software
    Students website, Suzuko, Kalemeh World Network, Club, Ahaber website). No
    independent information could be obtained from Parseh Research Center.
    According to information published by certain sources such as Kalemeh
    World Network, Mr. Molavi had worked with the Information Ministry s
    Physical Protection General Administration as a colleague and technical
    adviser. In an undated conversation, Mr. Molavi stated that he had worked
    with a group who was in charge of video control and protection of places
    such as Ayatollah Khamenei s room in the Supreme Leader s Beit (literally
    means home or Residence but it is a very large structure that contains the
    Leader s Offices and administration, among others) and the Hosseinieh (a
    type of mosque dedicated to Hossein, the third Shiite Imam) inside the
    Beit. (Kalemeh World Network, Pastoo Khaneh YouTube Channel). It is not
    clear why Mr. Molavi was living and residing in Turkey. The information
    that was published later, however, indicates that Mr. Molavi was looking
    to leave Turkey and immigrate to other countries, including the United
    States. In Turkey, Mr. Molavi ran a Telegram page and several other
    accounts in other social networks called Ja beh-ye Siah ( the Black Box ).
    The Black Box Telegram Channel which was updated daily until November 14,
    2019, the day he was killed, published articles, news and documented
    pieces against government institutions and individuals, including the
    Supreme Leader s Beit, the Judiciary Branch, the Information Ministry, the
    Communications Ministry and its then-Minister, and the Revolutionary
    Guards Corps of the Islamic Republic of Iran. (Poshte Pardeh ( Behind the
    Scenes ) YouTube Channel, Black Box Telegram Channel, from May 4, 2018, to
    November 14, 2019, Ahaber Website, Twitter, BBC Persian). A short time
    after the establishment of the Black Box Telegram Channel, numerous posts
    were shared on it in support of Mahmud Ahmadinejad, the former President
    of Iran. On August 7, 2018, the full text of Ahmadinejad s proposals to
    the Iranian Leader for fundamental reforms were published on this Channel,
    and in the following days and weeks, it re-published videos of Ahmadinejad
    and people close to him that were critical of Ayatollah Khamenei.
    Additionally, there are pictures of Mr. Molavi meeting with Mr.
    Ahmadinejad and Ayatollah Rafsanjani on various social networks.
    (Khabarban, Black Box Telegram Channel). This Channel gradually started
    directly criticizing the Leader of the Islamic republic, making claims
    that it was in possession of evidence and documentation regarding the
