    Mr. Qavimi was the father of two children and had great spirits. He loved
    nature and enjoyed mountain climbing, videography, and photography.
    Information regarding the death of Mr. Abdollah Qavimi Qalati, son of
    Behruz, was obtained through an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center with a person who knew him on November 29, 2019 (ABC
    interview). News of Mr. Qavimi s killing was also published in an Amnesty
    International report (May 20, 2020) and on the Human Rights Activists in
    Iran News Agency s website (HRANA). Additional information was obtained
    from Iran Wire reports (November 21, and December 26, 2019), Dadkhahi (
    Seeking Justice ) Campaign YouTube Channel (June 5, 2020), IRNA News
    Agency (November 21, 2020), and Quds Online website (November 22, 2020).
    Mr. Qavimi was born on March 25, 1973, in the city of Shiraz, and resided
    in the village of Qalat, 35 kilometers to the northwest of Shiraz. He had
    grown up in a six-member family, was married and had two children, 16 and
    4 years old. Mr. Qavimi was self-employed and worked in a real estate
    agency. He was a responsible and sociable individual who loved his family
    and had great spirits. He loved nature and enjoyed mountain climbing,
    videography, and photography. (ABC interview, Dadkhahi Campaign YouTube
    Channel). Background Right before midnight on November 14, 2019, the
    Iranian government announced a sharp increase in the price of gasoline (a
    50% increase for rationed gasoline, and a 200% increase for regular
    gasoline). Following the government s announcement, nationwide protests
    began on November 15. According to available reports and videos, the
    protesters gathered peacefully in public places on November 15 and 16, and
    caused very heavy traffic by blocking a number of streets. The protesters
    also chanted anti-governments slogans. Protesters across the country were
    asking their compatriots to turn their cars off and chant anti-regime
    slogans (1). According to reports, by the end of the day on November 16,
    banks had been set on fire in certain regions. Gunshots can be heard in
    some videos. That same night, the government blocked internet access in
    the entire country for at least ten days. Lack of access to information
    severely diminished the protesters ability to organize protests and report
    on the regime s brutal and ruthless clampdown of the demonstrators (2).
    The reaction of the Iranian authorities was swift, disproportionate,
    extreme, and deadly. From the very early days of the protests, that is, by
    November 16, the leaders of the Islamic Republic started to put the blame
    on the people in their public statements, and demonstrated that they would
    not tolerate any dissent or expression of discontent. The protesters were
    accused of being hoodlums and in contact with forces outside the country ,
    and were warned that they would suffer grave punishment if they damaged
    public property. News of the first casualty was reported on November 15.
    On the second day of the protests, the number of the dead increased as
    police and security forces continued to open fire on the populace in
    several cities. In video footage received from Iran, police and security
    forces can be seen firing their weapons into the demonstrators in
    circumstances where it does not appear that their lives are in danger.
    Plainclothes forces can also be seen beating people with clubs and
    arresting them. In certain cases, demonstrators blocked roads or gathered
    in front of police precincts or other government buildings, or pushed
    police and security forces back by throwing rocks. In several provinces,
    banks and other public buildings were set ablaze, seemingly by angry
    protesters, and the police can be seen damaging public property in some
    videos. The protests, which had spread to dozens of towns (120), roads,
    and locations outside urban areas, were quashed within a few days. The
    exact number of casualties is not clear at the time of this writing. In
    most cases, government agents took the dead and wounded protesters away.
    In an effort to hide the truth, these officials obtained written pledges
    from the victims families that they would remain silent in return for the
    bodies of their loved ones, and even forced some of them to bury their
    dead at night under the veil of darkness, and under the control and
    watchful eye of security agents. Others were asked for various sums of
    money. In its latest report published on May 20, 2020, Amnesty
    International announced the number of dead to have been at least 304 (3).
    A large number of the demonstrators had been shot in the head and chest.
    Hundreds of others were wounded, and the fate of many is unknown. The
    Iranian government confirmed the death of 6 members of the police and
    security forces. On May 31, 2020, the Interior Minister declared the
    number of people killed in the November protests to have been between 200
    and 225, 20 percent of whom were shot by non-governmental bullets (4). On
