    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein (Akbar) D. and one other individual
    named Mr. Hossein S. was published on the Golestan Province Judiciary
    website and on Mizan and Fars News Agencies websites (May 12, 2018),
    quoting the Head of Golestan Province Judiciary. Additional information
    about this case was obtained from Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting
    (IRIB) News Agency s website (April 7, 2018), Saten website (September 8,
    2017), Islamic Republic News Agency IRNA (September 7, 2017), Jam-e Jam
    Online (August 12, 13, 15 and 16, 2015), Young Journalists Club s website
    (August 13, 2015), Fars News Agency s website (August 12, 2015), and Iran
    newspaper (August 13, 2015). Mr. Hossein (Akbar) D. was married and had 10
    children. He was a carpenter. The case of Mr. Hossein (Akbar) D. and 16
    other individuals, known as the Serial Murders is related to murders and
    armed robberies committed in Golestan and Mazandaran Provinces between
    2000 and 2015. Arrest and detention Mr. Hossein (Akbar) D. was arrested in
    the city of Gorgan in late July 2015 by Golestan Province Criminal
    Investigation Bureau detectives and interrogated in the city s Bureau
    offices. Because of Mr. Hossein (Akbar) D. s criminal record, the
    detectives focused their investigations on him and the members of his
    family, and showed his and his sons photographs to witnesses for purposes
    of identification. Guided by eyewitnesses, first Mr. Hossein (Akbar) D. s
    25-year-old son was apprehended, and, upon admitting that his brother and
    father were involved in the robberies, the latter were also arrested. Mr.
    Hossein D. spent 2 years and 10 months in prison. Trial Gorgan Islamic
    Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Hossein (Akbar) D. and the other defendants
    in the case in 2016. (Fars News Agency May 12, 2018). Mr. Hossein (Akbar)
    D. s case and that of the other defendants was referred to the Province
    Criminal Court for a hearing on the private law aspect of the charges of
    murder and robbery. (IRNA, September 7, 2017). No information is available
    regarding the trial session(s). Charges The Head of Golestan Province
    Judiciary stated the charges against Mr. Hossein (Akbar) D. and the other
    defendants in the case as 13 counts of murder and 80 counts of armed
    robbery . According to available information, the defendants were armed
    when they were stealing automobiles or farming equipment, and shot and
    killed individuals while committing these felonies. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence against Mr. Hossein (Akbar) D. prior to his arrest was the
    eyewitness testimony of a young woman who had been present at the scene of
    one of Mr. Hossein (Akbar) D. s robberies and had witnessed his fight with
    the owner of the car. She told the detectives: The man who was holding the
    gun was short and I saw his eyebrows for an instant. His eyebrows were
    salt and pepper and it seemed like he was old. This testimony caused the
    detectives to focus their investigations on Mr. Hossein (Akbar) D. s
    family. (Hamshahri newspaper, August 12, 2015). Police detectives also
    used a company s closed circuit camera [video footage] located near the
    place of commission of one of the robberies as evidence against Mr.
    Hossein (Akbar) D. Other evidence used against him was stated to have been
    the defendants confessions, testimony of the individuals who had been
    robbed, prior criminal record, discovery of weapons, and the families
    complaints . International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense In an interview regarding the
    robberies, Mr. Hossein (Akbar) D. stated: [Nothing and no one] saw me
    armed where I went, not even the mosquitoes in the air. I went to places
    that were usually farm land. That is, I did not go to anybody s home, and
    I did not go to anybody s store. Even when I was committing robbery on
    some agricultural land, I would not go if I learned there were women or
    children there. As to why he was carrying a gun, he responded: I feared
    for my life. He added that he was stealing [electro] motors used in
    agricultural wells in order to pay for his family s living expenses.
    Regarding two counts of murder, he said: I had gone there to steal, and
    the murders were not intentional. (Hamshahri newspaper, August 17, 2015).
    No information is available regarding Mr. Hossein (Akbar) D. s defense at
    trial. Legal Analysis of Mr. Hossein (Akbar) D. s Case The defendant in
