    He was only 15 when he got involved in a brawl. He used to comfort his
    mother: Mum, don t be scarred. Nothing will happen to me. News of Mr.
    Abolfazl Chazani Sharahi s execution was published on the Jam iat-e Imam
    Ali Facebook page on June 27, 2018. Additional information about this case
    was obtained from an Abdorrahman Boroumand Center interview with a person
    close to him and from the Center s own research (July 7, 2018), Ghanoon
    News Website (July 8, 2018), Amnesty International website (January 19,
    2018), and a European Union statement (June 27, 2018). Mr. Abolfazl
    Chazani Sharahi, child of Asghar and Simin, was born on January 16, 1999,
    in the city of Qom. According to a person close to him, he was a child
    with a small and weak build and was mostly ill until the age of seven. He
    would mostly play soccer at school or go the Atari club. Mr. Chazani was a
    compassionate child, with a lot of love; he was also very determined and
    just had to work when there was a public gathering. For instance, on the
    occasion of the Middle of Sha ban (the Twelfth Shi a Imam s birthday), he
    would decorate the entire alley way with paper and strings. He loved Imam
    Hossein Ta zieh ([annual] mourning ceremonies set to music for the fourth
    Shi a Imam). (Boroumand Center interview). Mr. Chazani was born into a
    poor family that lived on the outskirts of the city of Qom, and had four
    brothers. He stayed in school until seventh grade and subsequently started
    to work at a Sohan (a type of hard candy for which Qom is famous) making
    shop. He would give his daily earnings to his mother every night when he
    came home from work. (Boroumand Center interview and Ghanoon News
    Website). Mr. Chazani s case is related to a murder that occurred in a
    street fight in Qom. He was 14 at the time of the event. Amnesty
    International demanded that the execution be halted. (Amnesty
    International Urgent Action, January 19, 2018). Noting Iran s
    international obligations, including the International Covenant on Civil
    and Political Rights as well as the Convention on the Rights of the Child,
    the European Union also objected to the implementation of this juvenile
    criminal s execution. (European Union Statement, June 27, 2018). Arrest
    and detention On the night of December 26, 2013, police officers went to
    Mr. Chazani s home to arrest him but he was not there. He went to the
    police precinct with his father when he came home that same night and gave
    himself up. That night, a fight had broken at 8:30 PM between several
    youths, one of whom had been stabbed. Mr. Chazani had fled the scene out
    of fear, and the injured individual died at the hospital a few days later.
    (Boroumand Center interview and the Court Decision, available at the
    Boroumand Center). Mr. Chazani spent four years and six months at the city
    of Qom s Kanun-e Eslah va Tarbiat ( Reform and Education Center ).
    According to a source with knowledge of the case, with his extroverted
    personality and sociable demeanor, he soon drew a lot of attention in
    prison. He was well-groomed and religious, and committed [to religious
    practice]; he did his prayers and fasts. He quickly became the ward
    representative and tended to the prisoners affairs. The Reform and
    Education Center had issued him a good character letter. According to a
    published report, he had not engaged in a single fight in prison. (Ghanoon
    News Website). According the source with knowledge of the case, he had
    changed a lot in prison and had actually matured. (Boroumand Center
    interview). Based on available information, during his incarceration, Mr.
    Chazani was called on four times for the implementation of his sentence.
    According to a person close to him, he was taken to quarantine when he was
    15 (so that the sentence could be carried out) where he spent the night
    with several other prisoners; he was taken back to the Reform and
    Education Center the next day after the others were executed. The second
    and third times were when he was 16: The second time, he was taken to
    quarantine by himself where he spent the night alone, and the third time
    he was with several others who were subsequently executed. (Boroumand
    Center interview). Trial Mr. Chazani s trial took place on July 16, 2014,
    at Qom Province Criminal Court, Branch One, in the presence of the
    Prosecutor s representative, the plaintiffs, the defendant, along with his
    court-appointed lawyer. The prosecutor s representative asked that the
    defendant be punished and the victim s next of kin demanded Qesas. On July
    20, 2014, Mr. Chazani s attorney submitted his brief in defense of his
    client to the Court. Charges The Court charged Mr. Abolfazl Chazani with
    intentional murder . He was accused of having murdered a 20-year-old man
    in a street fight when he was 14 (three weeks before turning 15). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
