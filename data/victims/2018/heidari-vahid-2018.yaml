    He was an honest, healthy, and well-built young man who worked hard in
    cold and hot weather just to make ends meet Information regarding the
    death of Mr. Vahid Heidari was published by ISNA News Agency (January 6,
    2018), and on Mr. Mohammad Najafi, attorney at law in the city of Arak s
    facebook page (January 7, 2018). Additional information about this case
    was obtained from the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interviews with two
    individuals with knowledge of the case (January 9, 2018), from ISNA and
    Mizan news agencies, BBC Persian website (January 9, and February 2,
    2018), Iran Campaign for Human Rights website (January 9, 2018), Euronews
    (February 2, 2018), Voice of America (January 7, 2018), and Aftab and
    Young Reporters Club websites (January 10, 2018). Mr. Vahid Heidari, Child
    of Hassan, was single, 23 years old, from the village of Takieh near the
    town of Shazand, and resided in the city of Arak in Markazi Province. He
    was a street vendor and spread his items at the entrance to the city of
    Arak s bazaar, in the same place where other street vendors gathered to
    sell their things. He came from a poor family and had two brothers and
    three sisters. His father was an injured Iran-Iraq war veteran, and
    several of his relatives had also been killed in the war. According to his
    friends, Mr. Heidari was an honest, healthy, and well-built young man who
    worked hard in cold and hot weather just to make ends meet. This case is
    related to Mr. Heidari s killing in detention; he had been arrested in the
    first days of nationwide demonstrations. Background Nationwide Protests
    Popular public protests began on Thursday, December 28, 2018. On the first
    day, thousands of people in Mashhad, Kashmar, Birjand, and Neishabur in
    Khorassan Razavi Province participated in the No To Rising Prices
    demonstrations. In videos of these demonstrations disseminated online in
    social networks and in the media, the protestors chanted slogans of Death
    To Rohani and Death to the Dictator , You ve destroyed Islam, The people
    have had enough , and Nothing is in its right place when Iran doesn t have
    a Shah . On the second day, protests spread to other cities in Iran
    including Esfahan, Shiraz, Tabriz, Rasht, Sari, Ghouchan, Sabzevar, and
    Khorramabad, and the protestors slogans turned against the institutions of
    the Islamic republic and the Leader himself. With the city of Qom joining
    other protesting cities, slogans were chanted in support of Reza Shah
    Phalavi. Videos of the days protests disseminated on social media show
    that in the cities of Qom, Hamedan, Qazvin, Qaemshahr, and Bojnurd,
    slogans of Death to the Dictator , Reza Shah, joy be upon your soul , Let
    go of Syria, think of a solution for us were chanted. On the third day,
    simultaneous with government sponsored demonstrations celebrating Dey
    9th(December 30) in Tehran s Mosalla ( Prayer Place ), protests continued
    across Iran in Kermanshah, Dezful, Karaj s Gohardasht Neighborhood, Rasht,
    Arak, Shiraz, Shar-e Kord, Khorramabad, Zanjan, Bandar Abbas, Semnan, and
    Hashtgerd, with skirmishes breaking out between protestors and government
    forces; at least two people were killed in the town of Dorud in Lorestan
    Province. On December 31, 2018, protests continued in Tehran, Mashhad,
    Kermanshah, Rasht, Arak, Tabriz, Maragheh, Behshahr, Chahbahar, Hashtgerd,
    Orumieh, Dorud, amd Malayer. Iranian Television reported the death of 10
    people in the protests, and [the town of] Izeh s representative announced
    2 individuals had been killed in that town. Hamedan Governor s office also
    reported the death of 3 people. In a cabinet meeting, Iranian President
    Hassan Rohani addressed the protests for the first time and while
    reiterating the people s right to peaceful protests, stated that the
    government would not tolerate chaos and disorder. On the fifth day,
    January 1, 2018, the protests became more violent, with a police precinct
    in the town of Qahdarijan in Esfahan Province set ablaze, following which
    6 people were killed. The Iranian President, Hassan Rohani said that the
    protestors were not people who had received orders from abroad, and had
    come onto the streets because of [the pressure of] their problems and
    [based on] their feelings. The next day, however, the Iranian Leader of
    the Revolution [Ayatollah Khamenei] announced that the recent events were
    the work of foreign enemies of the Islamic regime , [directly
    contradicting President Rohani]. At the end of the sixth day of protests,
    the number of deaths stood at 21, according to Iranian officials. Seven
    days after the protests had begun, the regime s supporters started
    demonstrations in various cities at the government s invitation, and
    condemned the popular protests. On that same day, even though smaller
    protests occurred in Malayer, Noshahr, Gohardasht, and Amol, the protests
    generally began to subside. The head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps
    held a former official responsible for the protests and announced the end
    of the new sedition . On the eigh
