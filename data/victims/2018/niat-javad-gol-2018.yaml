    The execution of Mr. Javad Gol Niat, son of Teymur, was reported by HRANA
    Website, the Human Rights Activists in Iran News Agency, and Human Rights
    in Iran Monitoring Website (March 12, 2018). This execution was not
    reported by official news agencies. Mr. Gol Niat was 30 years old; he was
    born in Khoy, in Azarbaijan-e Gharbi Province. He resided in the village
    of Hesar e Sofla, he was married, and he had two very young daughters. His
    case is related to sexual crimes. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Gol Niat s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on Mr. Gol Niat s trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr Gol Niat was rape . The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense According to a
    well-informed source, Mr. Gol Niat consistently denied having committed
    such an act. On this basis, his family asked the prison warden to delay
    his execution, to no avail (HRANA). No information is available on Mr. Gol
    Niat s defense. Judgment Mr. Javad Gol Niat was sentenced to death by
    hanging. He was executed in Khoy Central Prison, in Azadbaijan-e Gharbi
    Province, on Sunday March 11, 2018.
