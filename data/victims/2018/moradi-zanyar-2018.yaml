    Believed that he was not being punished for a crime he had committed
    himself. He considered his case a political one and had asked for a fair
    trial on numerous occasions. News of the execution of Mr. Zanyar Moradi,
    his cousin, Loqman Moradi , and another individual, was published by Fars
    News Agency (September 8, 2018) and the official website of Tehran General
    and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office (September 8, 2018). Additional
    information was obtained through research and documentation by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, including official documents, as well as
    interviews with two persons with knowledge of the case, including a former
    ward mate (September 8, and 10, 2018) and other sources. (1) Mr. Zanyar
    Moradi, son of Eqbal, was born in 1988 in Marivan, a border town in
    Kurdistan Province. Mr. Moradi s father was a well-known political
    activist and lived in Iraqi Kurdistan. Mr. Moradi s family had entrusted
    him to his grandparents since he was a child. (Mostaghel newspaper,
    September 12, 2018). According to Mr. Moradi s ward mates, he had a great
    artistic flair and provided ideas to his cousin who created artistic
    products in prison. (Boroumand Center interview with one of Mr. Moradi s
    ward mates, September 10, 2018). He had a nice voice and liked music. He
    played musical instruments, specifically Setar (a traditional Iranian
    instrument), and sang, and encouraged others to sing along. Mr. Moradi
    spent most of his time in jail reading, and always wanted to continue his
    education. (Boroumand Center interview with a person who knew Mr. Moradi,
    September 8, 2018). He seriously pursued studying English and read
    philosophy and sociology books. He was very fond of technology as well.
    His fellow prisoners have described him as an intelligent and responsible
    person who was very sociable, and participated in prison group activities
    such as general cleaning of wards, in spite serious injury to his back and
    spine, suffered in the course of interrogations. (Boroumand Center
    interview with one of Mr. Moradi s ward mates, September 10, 2018).
    According to one of his ward mates, Mr. Moradi was an empathetic and
    sensitive person who also held strong logical principles based on human
    rights. He was frank and direct, and did not compromise his principles in
    spite of being a peace-seeking and tolerant man. He always criticized [the
    government s] centralization policies and lack of investment in Kurdistan.
    (Boroumand Center interview with one of Mr. Moradi s ward mates, September
    10, 2018). United Nations officials had repeatedly asked Iran to stop Mr.
    Moradi s execution. The last time they had transmitted a message to Iran
    was the day before his execution. (United Nations website, September 7,
    2018). Other human rights organizations, including Amnesty International,
    had expressed concern about the execution of Mr. Moradi and his cousin,
    both before and after the death sentence was carried out. (Boroumand
    Center research). In a communique issued after its implementation, Amnesty
    International objected to Mr. Moradi s execution, citing violations of
    fair trial standards. (Amnesty International website, September 8, 2018).
    According to reports, Mr. Moradi s case was related to the murder of three
    individuals in Marivan in 2009. Furthermore, since he came from a
    political family, the case s connection to his family s activities was
    brought up by the family, as well as by Mr. Moradi himself. Mr. Zanyar
    Moradi s father, Mr. Eqbal Moradi, was a member of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party. Mr. Eqbal Moradi had been the target of two
    assassination attempts in Iraqi Kurdistan in 2008 and 2018; the second one
    in July 2018 resulted in his death. The Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with the objective of gaining
    autonomy for Kurdistan in northwestern Iran. After the 1979 Revolution,
    disagreements between the new central Shiite government and the mainly
    Sunni Kurdistan resulted in armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards
    and the Peshmerga (PDKI militia), centering around issues such as the role
    of minorities in the drafting of the constitution, designation of Shiism
    as the official state religion, and, particularly, the question of
    Kurdistan s autonomy. Mass executions and fierce fighting continued for
    months in the region. In the four years that followed, PDKI lost much of
    its power in the region. A number of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan s
    leaders have been assassinated. Following internal conflicts, a schism
    occurred in the Party in 2006, and it was divided into two organizations,
    The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan and The Kurdistan Democratic
    Party . The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan which had suspended its
    armed activities in the 2000 s until about 2014, started using its
    Peshmergas that year in order to conduct an armed struggle against the
    Isklamic Republic. (Kayhan London, October 23, 2016). This and other armed
    Kurdish parties active in the region, accepted responsibility
