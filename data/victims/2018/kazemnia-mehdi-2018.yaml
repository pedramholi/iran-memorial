circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mehdi Kazemnia, son of Ali, along with four other
    people, was reported by the Human Rights Organization of Iran Website
    (March 5, 2018), and Kurdistan Human Rights Association Website, quoted
    from Hangaw Website (February 28, 2018). Mr. Kazemnia was a
    28-year-old-kord from Ilam. His case was related to the death of a person
    from Haft Cheshmeh Village. Arrest and detention Mr. Kazemnia spent
    several years in prison. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Kazemnia s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Kazemnia was murder in the first
    degree . According to available information, he killed his friend from the
    village of Haft Cheshmeh, during an altercation. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Kazemnia s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Mehdi Kazemnia was sentenced to death by hanging. He was
    executed in Orumieh Central Prison, on Wednesday February 28, 2018.
