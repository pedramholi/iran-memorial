    Joint explanation of the Kurdistan Human Rights Network (KHRN, or Network)
    and the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran (ABC, or
    Center): This case is a part of the collaborative documentation of the
    Kurdistan Human Rights Network and the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center. The
    Kurdistan Human Rights Network intends to gradually document cases of
    extrajudicial executions of Kurdish citizens and activists. For this
    purpose, the network has used the experiences and research methodology of
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, which has been active in the field of
    documenting human rights violations in Iran for many years. The report of
    this case and subsequent reports will be published in the "documentation"
    section of the Kurdistan Human Rights Network website and the "Omid
    Memorial" of the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center. Some of the original and
    follow-up interviews used in this documentation were conducted by the
    Center, some by the Network, and some in collaboration. Information
    related to the case of Mr. Farshad Chechani, the son of Maliheh
    Shah-Moradi and Esmaeil Chechani, has been obtained through interviews
    conducted with an eyewitness present on the scene immediately after the
    incident (October 13, 2018), with an informed source (February 18 and 19,
    2022), a civil society activist from Paveh (May 9, 2023), and a former
    ward-mate (May 3, 2022). Additional information was sourced from IRNA news
    agency (October 13, 2018), ISNA news agency (October 13, 2018) and various
    websites including Giareng (January 3, 2019), Deutsche Welle (July 10,
    2019), the official website of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (February
    16, 2016), Kurdistan Media (October 13, 2018), the website of the
    Kurdistan Human Rights Network (October 13, 2018), the official website of
    the PDKI (October 13, 2018), the Telegram channel of Kurdpa (October 12,
    2018), Akam News (October 22, 2018) and Bultan News (October 17, 2018).
    Mr. Chechani was born in 1979 in a large family in the city of Paveh,
    Kermanshah Province. He completed his primary and secondary education in
    the Sardarreh neighborhood of the same city. Mr. Chechani did not lead a
    prosperous life and had various occupations, including working as a
    construction worker, farmer, and walnut picker. He was also an irrigation
    manager outside the city of Paveh. He frequently traveled between the city
    and the villages, especially before sunrise, when gardens are usually
    watered (Interview with an informed source, February 18 and 19, 2022, and
    with a former ward-mate, May 3, 2022). Mr. Chechani was unmarried and was
    the sixth child in a family of ten. He had been summoned and interrogated
    several times by security authorities due to his communication with
    individuals affiliated with the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan
    (PDKI). He was detained for political reasons at least once in 1998. Mr.
    Chechani was also detained for a few months in 2009 on charges of
    possessing alcoholic beverages, and he was acquitted after proving his
    innocence. He was described by his acquaintances as a popular, reserved,
    self-contained, well-read, and politically sensitive individual. Mr.
    Chechani was not a member of any political organization (Interview with a
    former ward-mate, May 3, 2023). Background on the Formation of the
    Kurdistan Democratic Party The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan
    (PDKI) was established on August 16, 1945, with the goal of achieving
    autonomy for Iranian Kurdistan. According to the party's charter, this
    political organization was founded based on "national ideas and the
    organizational structure of the Society for Kurdish Resurrection (KJK),
    with a realistic and contemporary approach." The party was founded by a
    prominent Kurdish figure, Qazi Muhammad. KJK was the founder of the
    Republic of Kurdistan in Mahabad. The Republic of Kurdistan existed from
    January 22, 1946, to December 15, 1946, and ultimately fell after 11
    months. After going through a period of armed struggle in the 1960s,
    marked by internal disputes, the party eventually re-emerged as a
    political party on the verge of the Iranian Revolution. In 2006, due to
    internal disputes, the party split into two organizations: the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (HDK). After
    15 years of separation, these two parties announced their reintegration on
    August 22, 2022. Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic
    Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of
    politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the
    1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the
    country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since
    then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has
