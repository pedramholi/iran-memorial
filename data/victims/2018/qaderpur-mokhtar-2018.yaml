    started working on a farm after he dropped out of school. Mr. Qaderpur
    lost his uncle (his father s brother) and a number of other family members
    in 1993-94, in the course of the struggles against the Islamic republic.
    He established organizational contact with the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan beginning in approximately 2000-01. (Boroumand Center interview

    the case, May 16, 2021). After joining the Democratic Party of Iranian

    (Boroumand Center interview with Mr. Hiva Mirzai, May 16, 2021). Mr.
    Qaderpur was a well-informed, discerning, personable, and polite
    individual, and had tremendous respect for the Peshmerga with higher
    ranks, and others who had more experience than he did. (Boroumand Center
    interview with Mr. Hiva Mirzai, May 16, 2021). Mr. Qaderpur loved
    Kurdistan and freedom and was very interested in military activities. He
    constantly strived to follow the path of Dr. Qasemlu . The Kurdish Problem
    in the Islamic Republic After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the
    disagreements between the government of the Shiite Islamic Republic and
    the organizations in the Kurdish regions of western Iran regarding the
    rights and roles of minorities in drafting the Constitution; whether the
    government should be secular or religious, and especially the issue of
    Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in Kurdish political
    organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on instituting an
    Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed, clashes between the
    central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan Democratic Party s armed
    forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini labeled the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and most influential Kurdish
    Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it unofficial and illegal ,
    and ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass executions and intense
    armed clashes continued in the region for months, clashes that resulted in
    the deaths of a number of civilians and the displacement and relocation of
    the residents of certain towns. In the next four years, Kurdish parties
    lost their grip on power in the region to a great extent, and relocated to
    Iraqi Kurdistan. Since then, a number of their leaders and members have
    been assassinated outside Iran, especially in Iraqi Kurdistan. In the
    years since the Islamic Republic has been in existence, in addition to
    such entities as the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Komala
    (Revolutionary Organization of the Toilers of Iranian Kurdistan
