    had to quit school and work as a laborer in various towns due to his
    family s financial situation and the region s limited resources.
    Information about Mr. Amin Korki s murder was obtained from interviews
    conducted by the Boroumad Center with two of Mr. Korki s acquaintances
    (March 9, 12, and 23, 2019). The news of his murder was also published on
    the Iran Wire (March 2, 2019) and Iran International websites (March 5,
    2019). Additional information was obtained from documents such as the
    burial permit, the Medical Examiner s report, and the Iran Wire website
    (April 16, 2019). Mr. Amin Korki was 31 years old, single, and a day
    laborer from the town of Andimeshk, residing in the city of Dezful. People
    close to Mr. Korki considered him to be an honest and decent man. He was
    the fourth child of an 8-member family. Mr. Korki had studied through
    eighth grade but was forced to quit school due to his family s financial
    situation. Mr. Korki s mother was ill and he had to work as a day laborer
    in Khuzestan Province or cities in other provinces in order to provide for
    his family and to pay for his mother s medical expenses. In addition to
    his and his family s financial situation, the economic conditions of the
    town where he lived, such as the steep increase in the price of every day
    consumer goods, also bothered Mr. Korki. Mr. Korki participated in the
    January 2018 protests in the city of Dezful to protest the economic
    conditions. (Boroumand Center interview with one of Mr. Korki s
    acquaintances, March 9, 2019). On the morning of January 3, 2018, Dezful s
    18thPolice Precinct officers (located in the Hamzeh Subdivision) as well
    as a number of plainclothes agents and individuals from Bassij, entered
    Mr. Korki s family home, jumping in over the neighbor s wall, beat Mr.
    Korki and his father, and arrested Mr. Korki without a warrant. Mr. Korki
    s father brought a complaint against the 18thPrecinct for having beaten
    him but his case was not heard for lack of witnesses. (Boroumand Center
    interview with one of Mr. Korki s acquaintances, March 9, 2019). Upon his
    arrest, Mr. Korki was first taken to Dezful s Hamzeh Subdivision s
    18thPolice Precinct where he was interrogated and tortured. He was
    physically tortured at the Precinct by being punched, kicked, beaten with
    a club and an electric cable. The signs of torture, i.e. bruises and
    redness, were visible on his body the next day and at the Investigating
    Judge s Office where he was questioned. (Iran Wire, March 2, 2019;
    Boroumand Center interview with one of Mr. Korki s acquaintances, March 9,
    2019). On January 4, 2018, Mr. Korki s interrogation session and that of
    three other individuals took place at the Dezful General and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor s Office, Investigating Judge s Office Branch Six, resulting in
    the issuance of a Temporary Detention Order for Mr. Korki. He was then
    transferred to Dezful General Prison. Mr. Korki s questioning continued
    while he was in jail. He was facing the charge of leading the January 2018
    riots and protests in his neighborhood in the city of Dezful, as well as
    the charge of tearing up pictures of Ayatollah Khomeini and Ayatollah
    Khamenei. Mr. Korki s co-defendants were released from prison a short
    while later on bail; Mr. Korki, however, remained in jail without the
    right to visit and contact his family and without access to an attorney
    until his temporary release on March 17, 2018. His family could not afford
    to hire a lawyer for him due to their financial situation, and the court
    did not appoint one for him. Mr. Korki was released from prison pending
    his trial, by putting up as collateral a pay stub provided by his family.
    (Iran Wire, March 2, 2019; Iran International, March 5, 2019; Boroumand
    Center interview with one of Mr. Korki s acquaintances, March 9, 2019).
    Mr. Korki s case had been referred to the Dezful Revolutionary Court
    Branch One during his temporary detention. (Boroumand Center interview
    with one of Mr. Korki s acquaintances, March 9, 2019). After his release,
    Mr. Korki s family advised him not to leave the house. Dezful
    Revolutionary Court judge s personal consideration of Mr. Korki s case and
    laying the groundwork for his release, had created apprehension in his
    family s mind that something was about to happen. The family was also
    suspicious of police officers comings and goings around their home and in
    the days following Mr. Korki s release. (Iran Wire, April 16, 2019).
    Nationwide Protests Popular public protests began on Thursday, December
    28, 2017. On the first day, thousands of people in Mashhad, Kashmar,
    Birjand, and Neishabur in Khorassan Razavi Province participated in the No
    To Rising Prices demonstrations. In most protests, the demonstrators
    chanted slogans against administrative and financial corruption, and
    against the incapability of governmental and state institutions in
    resolving economic issues. In videos of these demonstrations disseminated
    online in social networks and in the media, the protestors also cha
