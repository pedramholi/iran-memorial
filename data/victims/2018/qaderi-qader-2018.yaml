    person who established a rapport with the people around him and did not
    get angry . Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Qader
    Qaderi, son of Osman, was obtained through interviews conducted by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with a family member (October 20, 2021), one
    of the attorneys in the case (November 17, 2021) and Kamal Karimi, member
    of the Kurdistan Democratic Party s Political Office (January 1, 2021;
    February 4, 2021; March 2, 2021). Additional information was obtained from
    the Kurdistan Democratic Party s Charter, passed in its 16thCongress
    (February 2016); the Persian Section of the website of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party, Kurdistan u Kurd (February 16, 2016; March 8, and 19,
    2018; August 2, and 5, 2021; August 29, 2018); ISNA News Agency (September

    (March 8, 2018; July 22, 2018; July 10, 2019); Giarang website (January 3,
    2019); Radio Farda (March 7, 2018); Facebook, Ista Page (August 2, 2021);

    village on the outskirts of [the town of] Piranshahr in West Azarbaijan
    Province. He finished fifth grade in that same village. Mr. Qaderi joined
    the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan as Peshmerga in 1981, and
    remained a member of the Party until the very last moments of his life. He
    worked for various sections within the Party. Mr. Qaderi was initially a
    Peshmerga, and subsequently was Party cadre, and then functioned as a
    military commander in the Democratic Party. He was active in the Party s
    Education, Organizational, Social, and Judicial Sections. In the final
    years of his life, in addition to being protection commander , he was also
    commander of Helgurd forces * of the Kurdistan Democratic Party stationed
    on the border between Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan. (Boroumand Center
    interview, November 17, 2021). According to one of the Party s
    spokespeople, he had been a military commander in the past but he was in
    charge of one of the organizational sections in recent years . (Radio
    Farda, March 7, 2018). Mr. Qaderi was married and had six children. Family
    members described him as a very calm and collected person who established
    a rapport with the people around him and did not get angry . (Boroumand
    Center interview, November 17, 2021). The Kurdistan Democratic Party
    described him as a prominent cadre and an eminent [military] commander .
    (Website of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, Kurdistan u Kurd, March 8,
    2018). The Kurdish Problem in the Islamic Republic After the 1979 Islamic
    Revolution, the disagreements between the government of the Shiite Islamic
    Republic and the organizations in the Kurdish regions of western Iran
    regarding the rights and roles of minorities in drafting the Constitution;
    whether the government should be secular or religious, and especially the
    issue of Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in Kurdish
    political organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on
    instituting an Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed,
    clashes between the central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan
    Democratic Party s armed forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini
    labeled the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and
    most influential Kurdish Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it
    unofficial and illegal , and ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass
    executions and intense armed clashes continued in the region for months,
    clashes that resulted in the deaths of a number of civilians and the
    displacement and relocation of the residents of certain towns. In the next
    four years, Kurdish parties lost their grip on power in the region to a
    great extent, and relocated to Iraqi Kurdistan. Since then, a number of
    their leaders and members have been assassinated outside Iran, especially
    in Iraqi Kurdistan. In the years since the Islamic Republic has been in
    existence, in addition to such entities as the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan, Komala (Revolutionary Organization of the Toilers of Iranian
    Kurdistan), the Koran School led by Ahmad Moftizadeh, Organization of
    Iranian Kurdistan Struggle (which was active in the early years of the
    Revolution), certain other Kurdish opposition parties were established
    outside Iran, such as the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) and the
    Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK). These parties, with policies and ideologies
    that are not necessarily similar and uniform, have settled in parts of the
    Kurdistan Autonomous Region in Iraq, such as Koy, Soleimanieh, and in the
    foothills of Qandil mountains. Some of these parties have undergone splits
    in recent years. These conflicts have been more about the methods of
    running the organizations rather than theoretical and ideological
    differences. These parties have not controlled any part of the Iranian
    territory since the late 1980 s, and have
