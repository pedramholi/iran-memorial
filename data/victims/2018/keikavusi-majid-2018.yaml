    The execution of Mr. Majid Keikavusi was reported by the Human Rights of
    Iran Website (February 13, 2018) and, along with five other people, by
    HRANA, Human Rights Activists News Agency (February 15, 2018). This
    execution was not reported by official news agencies. Mr. Keikavusi was
    from Marand and his case is related to a murder in 2013. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Keikavusi spent five years in prison. On January 24, 2018,
    he was transferred from Maraqeh Prison to Zanjan Central Prison. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Keikavusi s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Keikavusi was murder in the first degree . He was
    involved in an altercation with someone who owed him 9 million tumans.
    During this altercation the debtor was killed. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense Mr. Keikavusi did not intend to kill the victim. The
    murder happened during an accidental altercation (Human Rights
    Organization of Iran). No information is available on his defense.
    Judgment Mr. Majid Keikavusi was sentenced to death by hanging. He was
    executed in Zanjan Central Prison on Tuesday February 13, 2018.
