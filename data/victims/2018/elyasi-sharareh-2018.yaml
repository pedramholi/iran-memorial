    was warm, kind, and fashionable News of the execution of Ms. Sharareh
    Elyasi, child of Zahed, was provided to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center
    on November 19, 2018, through one of her acquaintances. Furthermore, news
    of her execution was published on the Iran Human Rights Organization s
    website (November 13, 2018), the Hengaw website (November 13, 2018), and
    the Kordpa website (November 13, 2018). Additional information about this
    case was obtained through a Boroumand Center interview with another one of
    Ms. Elyasi s acquaintances on April 4, 2019, the A Look at Human Rights in
    Kurdistan of Iran website (November 22, 2018), and the Rozaneh
    website(November 13, 2018). Ms. Elyasi was 27 years old, married, with one
    child, and came from the village of Bissaran in Sarvabad County in
    Kurdistan Province. (Hengaw; Boroumand Center interview with one of Ms.
    Elyasi s acquaintances on November 19, 2018; A Look at Human Rights in
    Kurdistan of Iran website). A person who knew Ms. Elyasi described her as
    a beautiful, cheerful, warm, kind, and fashion conscious individual. She
    established good relations with the people around her. (Boroumand Center
    interview with one of Ms. Elyasi s acquaintances on April 4, 2019). Ms.
    Elyasi had gotten married at the age of 16 due to her family s financial
    situation. (Boroumand Center interview with one of Ms. Elyasi s
    acquaintances on November 19, 2018; A Look at Human Rights in Kurdistan of
    Iran website). Arrest and detention According to available information,

    She only had occasion to visit with her child early in her detention.
    Thereafter, her husband prevented the visitations. (Boroumand Center
    interview with one of Ms. Elyasi s acquaintances on April 4, 2019). She
    dealt with a lot of psychological pressure during her detention. (Kordpa).
    In prison, Ms. Elyasi was the ward representative. She made ends meet by
    working in the prison kitchen and by distributing food and medicine
    between the prisoners since she did not receive any financial support from
    her family and her husband. She had an excellent morale and used to sing
    every now and then. (Boroumand Center interview with one of Ms. Elyasi s
    acquaintances on April 4, 2019). Trial Sanandaj Islamic Revolutionary
    Court tried Ms. Elyasi. No further information is available about the
    details of Ms. Elyasi s trial session(s). According to available
    information, Ms. Elyasi could not afford to hire a lawyer due to her
    financial situation. There is no information about whether she had a court
    appointed attorney at trial or not. Charges Ms. Elyasi was charged with
    intentional murder . According to a person who knew Ms. Elyasi, she
    intended to get a divorce from her spouse because she was in love with
    another man, but her family and husband opposed it. Ms. Elyasi s spouse
    found out about her feelings for that man and invited him to their home.
    He killed him while his wife was putting things in order in the kitchen.
    According to this person who has knowledge of the case, Ms. Elyasi took on
    the murder because her husband had asked her to. (Boroumand Center
    interview with one of Ms. Elyasi s acquaintances on November 19, 2018;
    Kordpa). According to Rozaneh website, however, Ms. Elyasi s husband had
    killed the victim claiming that he had harassed his sister. According to
    this information, Ms. Elyasi s husband used the little legal knowledge Ms.
    Elyasi had, and convinced her to accept the murder. Ms. Elyasi thought
    that she would not be given the death penalty because she was a woman.
    (Rozaneh). Ms. Elyasi s other acquaintance believed the murder to be
    related to the victim s harassment of Ms. Elyasi, and thereby causing the
    commission of murder by her husband. According to this information, Ms.
    Elyasi was only a witness to the murder and had played no role in its
    commission. Ms. Elyasi was hoping her husband would eventually lay the
    groundwork for her release. (Boroumand Center interview with one of Ms.
    Elyasi s acquaintances on April 4, 2019). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
