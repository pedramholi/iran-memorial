    She was married to her husband when she was only 13 years old, and was
    arrested when she was 17. News of Ms. Mahbubeh Mofidi s execution was
    published in Iran newspaper (February 3, 2018) and on the website of Iran
    Human Rights Organization (February 1, 2018). Additional information about
    this execution was obtained from the website of Iran Human Rights
    Organization (February 5, 2018). Ms. Mofidi was born on May 18, 1997, in a
    village outside the city of Noshahr in Mazandaran Province. She was
    married to her husband in 2009, when she was less than 13 years old. Ms.
    Mofidi s case, known as the 17-year-old new bride, is related to a murder
    committed on December 17, 2013, in a village outside of the city of
    Noshahr. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress . Arrest and detention Ms. Mofidi was
    arrested and detained in 2014. The exact date of the arrest is not
    available. Ms. Mofidi was incarcerated at Noshahr Prison. Following the
    suspicious death of Ms. Mofidi s husband, the Criminal Police had put her
    under surveillance. When the Medical Examiner s toxicology results were
    released, Ms. Mofidi, who had expressed her innocence when she was first
    questioned after her husband s demise, was the first person to be arrested
    in the investigations into her husband s death, and was subjected to
    interrogations. (Iran newspaper). Trial No information is available about
    Ms. Mofidi s trial session(s). According to available information, Ms.
    Mofidi was represented by an attorney. Charges Ms. Mofidi was charged with
    being the principal in the murder [of her spouse]. She was accused of
    having murdered her husband with the aid of her husband s brother. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt According to the authorities, in the course of its
    investigations, the Criminal Investigations Police had obtained certain
    evidence, and was positive that Ms. Mofidi was involved in the murder of
    her spouse. These sources also refer to technical and expert
    interrogations and to Ms. Mofidi s confession to killing her husband, in a
    conspiracy with her husband s brother in order to marry him. (Iran
    newspaper). There is no information regarding the evidence used against
    Ms. Mofidi at trial in the report of this execution. Because of her
    ignorance of the law and because she wanted to prevent her brother-in-law
    from being executed, she made a false confession admitting to have been
    involved in the plan to murder her husband. The Coroner s (Medical
    Examiner s) autopsy of Ms. Mofidi s husband showed that he had been killed
    on December 17, 2013, by ingesting rice pills. (Iran newspaper and Iran
    Human Rights Organization). In preliminary investigations, Ms. Mofidi had
    stated: My husband and I had a good life together. On the night of the
    incident, my husband said that he wasn t feeling well and took some
    Amoxicillin and Mefenamic Acid pills and went to sleep. However, he became
    very ill a few hours later. I immediately got in touch with his family and
    we took him to the hospital with the help of his brother, but
    unfortunately he passed away. (Iran newspaper). According to official
    reports, Ms. Mofidi confessed to killing her husband some time later
    during interrogations, and recounted the story as follows: A short while
    after marrying my husband, I fell in love with his brother and this love
    was so strong that it took us to where we decided to kill my husband and
    get married. Therefore, we made plans and my husband s brother placed rice
    pills inside Amoxicillin and Mefenamic acid capsules and gave them to me.
    I then had my husband take the capsules, telling him that they were
    effective in helping us have children more quickly; and that resulted in
    his death. (Iran newspaper). Defense A person close to Ms. Mofidi believes
    she had not participated in murdering her husband and that she was simply
    the victim of a brother killing his brother . This person believed that
    the murder of Ms. Mofidi s husband was his brother s plan and stated: The
    victim s brother confessed to killing his brother when he was arrested,
    and said that Mahbubeh had no knowledge of the content of the capsules,
    which contained rice pills. However, later, in the second trial session,
    upon his family s insistence and threats, he changed his confessions.
    (Iran Human Right Organization). A person close to Ms. Mofidi believes she
    was a victim of fratricide According to this person, Ms. Mofidi had no
    knowledge of the content of the capsules and had trusted her
    brother-in-law who had said that the pills are beneficial to your husband
    s treatment and had given them to her spouse on that basis. (Iran Human
