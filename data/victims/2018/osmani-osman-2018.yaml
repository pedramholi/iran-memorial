    1979 Islamic Revolution, the disagreements between the government of the
    Shiite Islamic Republic and the organizations in the Kurdish regions of
    western Iran regarding the rights and roles of minorities in drafting the
    Constitution; whether the government should be secular or religious, and
    especially the issue of Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in
    Kurdish political organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on
    instituting an Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed,
    clashes between the central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan
    Democratic Party s armed forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini
    labeled the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and
    most influential Kurdish Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it
    unofficial and illegal , and ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass
    executions and intense armed clashes continued in the region for months,
    clashes that resulted in the deaths of a number of civilians and the
    displacement and relocation of the residents of certain towns. In the next
    four years, Kurdish parties lost their grip on power in the region to a
    great extent, and relocated to Iraqi Kurdis
