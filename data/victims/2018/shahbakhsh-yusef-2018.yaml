    News of the execution of Mr. Yusef Shahbakhsh, son of Jalaleddin, along
    with 11 others including his uncle was published on the websites of Mizan
    News Agency (February 20, 2019) and HRANA (December 6, 2018). Additional
    information was collected from the websites of Gunaz TV (December 6,
    2018), Baloch Activists Campaign (December 8, 2018), Campaign to Defend
    Civil and Political Prisoners in Iran (December 6, 2018), Iran Human
    Rights (December 4, 2018) and Human Rights Defense Association for Iran
    (February 3, 2019). Mr. Shahbakhsh, 30 years old, was Baluch and from the
    Qanbarzehi tribe of the Shahbakhsh clan. He was from Khash in Sistan va
    Baluchestan. The case of Mr. Shahbakhsh, his uncle and two others* was
    related to drug activities in Kerman in 2010. Arrest and detention In
    2010, Police Officers raided Mr. Shahbakhsh s home in Kahnuj and arrested
    him (Human Rights Defense Association for Iran). He was in prison for
    eight years and spent most of his time in Kahnuj Prison, and was then
    transferred to Kerman Prison. Mr. Shahbakhsh s family visited him for the
    last time in Kerman Prison (HRANA, Baloch Activists Campaign, Gunaz TV).
    Mr. Shahbakhsh s family mentioned that he was calm during the very last
    visit (Human Rights Defense Association for Iran). Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Shahbakhsh s trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Shahbakhsh was announced as drug trafficking (Mizan News Agency).
    Baloch Activists Campaign announced his charge as carrying drugs and in
    the news published by Human Rights Defense Association for Iran, he was
    also charged with possessing and carrying arms . The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution on the website of
    Human Rights Defense Association for Iran mentions the possession of a
    weapon as evidence brought against Mr. Shahbakhsh. Defense The request for
    an appeal in Mr. Shahbakhsh and his codefendants case based on the 2018
    drug law reform was rejected (Iran Human Rights). According to those close
    to Mr. Shahbakhsh, there was no weapon found in his home during the raid.
    Mr. Shahbakhsh had denied the possession of weapon in his early
    interrogations, he then confessed to the possession of weapon under
    torture (Human Rights Defense Association for Iran). International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. There is
    no information available on his defense during trial. Judgment Mr. Yusef
    Shahbakhsh, his uncle ( Jalil Shahbakhsh ), two other codefendants as well
    as at least 11 other people were hanged in Kerman Central Prison on
    December 6, 2018. According to a source close to him, he did not expect
    his execution. (Human Rights Defense Association for Iran) His body was
    given to his family (Gunaz TV). ------------------------------------------
