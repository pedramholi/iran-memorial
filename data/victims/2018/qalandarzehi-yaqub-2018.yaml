    News of the execution of Mr. Ya qub Qalandarzehi along with 11 others was
    published on the websites of Mizan News Agency (February 20, 2019) and
    HRANA (December 6, 2018). Additional information was collected from the
    websites of Gunaz TV (December 6, 2018), Campaign to Defend Civil and
    Political Prisoners in Iran (December 6, 2018), Iran Human Rights
    (December 4, 2018) and Human Rights Defense Association for Iran (February
    3, 2019). Mr. Qalandazehi was Baluch and from the Vali Mohammadzehi tribe
    of the Qalanderzehi clan. He was from Gohar Kuh village of Khash in Sistan
    va Baluchestan. (Gunaz TV) The case of Mr. Qalanderzehi and three others*
    was related to drug activities in Kerman in 2010. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Qalandarzehi and his three codefendants were arrested in Kahnuj in 2010
    (Human Rights Defense Association for Iran). He was in prison for eight
    years and spent most of his time in Kahnuj Prison, and was then
    transferred to Kerman Prison. Mr. Qalandarzehi s family visited him for
    the last time in Kerman Prison (HRANA, Baloch Activists Campaign, Gunaz
    TV). Trial No information is available on Mr. Qalandarzehi s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Qalandarzehi was announced as drug
    charges . The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense The request for an appeal
    in Mr. Qalandarzehi and his codefendants case based on the 2018 drug law
    reform was rejected (Iran Human Rights). There is no information available
    on his defense during trial. Judgment Mr. Ya qub Qalandarzehi and 11 other
    people were hanged in Kerman Central Prison on December 6, 2018. His body
    was given to his family (Gunaz TV).
