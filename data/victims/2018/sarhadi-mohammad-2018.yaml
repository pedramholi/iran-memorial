    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Sarhadi was reported by HRANA Website, the
    Human Rights Activists in Iran News Agency, and Fa alin Baluch Campaign
    (May 14, 2018). This execution was not reported by the official news
    agencies. Mr. Sarhadi was 33 years old, and his case is related to murder.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Sarhadi was incarcerated in Zahedan Central
    Prison, for six years, starting in 2012. On Wednesday May 10, 2018, he was
    transferred from section 4 of the prison to solitary confinement. However,
    the detailed circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Sarhadi s trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Sarhadi was murder . The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Sarhadi s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Mohammad Sarhadi was sentenced to death by hanging. He was
    executed in Zahedan Central Prison, on Monday May 14, 2018. In December
    2017, Mr. Sarhadi had been transferred to solitary confinement in
    anticipation of execution, but he had been granted a reprieve by the
    family of the victim. At that time, he was taken from the gallows back to
    the prison.
