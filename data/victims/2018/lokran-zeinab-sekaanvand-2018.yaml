    got married when she was only 15 years old and was abused verbally and
    physically by her husband repeatedly. The news of the execution of Mrs.
    Zeinab Sekaanvand Lokran, daughter of Khatoon and Mohammad, was published
    on the websites of Mizan News Agency on October 7, 2018 and Iranian Labour
    News Agency (ILNA) on October 8, 2018. Additional information regarding
    this execution was obtained through Human Rights Activists News Agency-
    HRANA (October 2, 2018), Center for Human Rights in Iran (October 2,
    2018), Kurdistan Human Rights Network (May 15 and October 4, 2016, and
    January 8, 2017), Iran Human Rights (October 7, 2016), and Amnesty
    International newsletters (October 11, 2016 and March 17, 2017). Mrs.
    Sekaanvand was born on June 22, 1994 in a poor, traditional Kurdish family
    in the city of Maku in West Azerbaijan Province. She got married in
    February/March 2010 when she was just 15, and according to one of her
    relatives, she was abused verbally and physically by her husband (HRANA,
    Center for Human Rights in Iran, Amnesty International newsletter, October
    11, 2016). Mrs. Sekaanvand s case was related to her husband s death in
    the city of Urmia, West Azerbaijan Province, on February 24, 2012. At the
    time of the incident, Mrs. Sekaanvand was 17 years old. International laws
    have strictly prohibited capital punishment for those who were under the
    age of 18 at the time of committing a crime. As a party to the
    International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on
    the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation not to impose capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. On October
    11, 2016, Amnesty International urged the Iranian authorities to stop
    execution of Mrs. Sekaanvand. Mrs. Sekaanvand was held in a police station
    for 20 days, during which she was repeatedly beaten by police officers.
    Arrest and detention Information regarding the exact time and manner of
    arrest and detention of Mrs. Sekaanvand is contradictory. According to
    Mrs. Sekaanvand s lawyer, she turned herself into police on February 24,
    2012. Based on Amnesty International s report, Mrs. Sekaanvand was held in
    a police station for 20 days, during which she was repeatedly beaten by
    police officers. After 20 days, Mrs. Sekaanvand was transferred to Urmia
    Central Prison (Center for Human Rights in Iran, Amnesty International s
    newsletter). However, according to some other news agencies, Mrs.
    Sekaanvand was arrested on March 1, 2012, and spent the first two years of
    detention at the city of Khoy s Prison and after the court order was
    issued, she was transferred to the women s ward of Urmia Central Prison
    (HRANA, Kurdistan Human Rights Network, Iran Human Rights). In 2015/2016,
    Mrs. Sekaanvand married a prisoner in the Urmia Central Prison and became
    pregnant, but due to psychological stress after the execution of one of
    her cellmates, the baby was born stillborn in Urmia on September 30, 2016.
    According to Amnesty International, Mrs. Sekaanvand was returned to prison
    one day after her delivery and was deprived of access to medical care and
    a psychologist (HRANA, Center for Human Rights in Iran, Iran Human Rights,
    and Kurdistan Human Rights Network- October 4, 2016). Mrs. Sekaanvand was
    deprived of access to medical services during pregnancy and was examined
    by a doctor once. Two weeks before Mrs. Sekaanvand s delivery, the prison
    s health clinic made a request to send her to a hospital for examination
    and ultrasound, but prison authorities refused this request (Kurdistan
    Human Rights Network- October 4, 2016). In January 2017, the authorities
    in Urmia Central Prison banned Mrs. Sekaanvand from weekly visits with her
    husband. The reason for such a decision was the widespread news about Mrs.
    Sekaanvand s case in the foreign media and human rights organizations. In
    protest against this decision, Mrs. Sekaanvand had been on hunger strike
    since January 7, 2017 (Kurdistan Human Rights Network, January 8, 2017).
    Mrs. Sekaanvand did not meet with her lawyer until the last session of the
    trial. During the preliminary investigation, Mrs. Sekaanvand was denied
    access to a lawyer. Since she was not financially capable of recruiting a
    lawyer, the court appointed her a lawyer (Amnesty International
    newsletters, October 11, 2016 and Kurdistan Human Rights Network, January
    8, 2017). Mrs. Sekaanvand did not meet with her lawyer until the last
    session of the trial (Amnesty International newsletters, March 17, 2017).
    Trial Branch Two of the Criminal Court in Urmia County tried Mrs.
    Sekaanvand in three sessions. The final court session was held on October
    18, 2014 (Kurdistan Human Rights Network, October 4, 2016). Charges The
    charge brought against Mrs. Sekaanvand was murder. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
