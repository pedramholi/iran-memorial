    revoked Gozaresh-e Film s publishing license and shuttered it for a year.
    It also sentenced Zargar to five years of suspension from press-related

    renting the publication license to persons lacking legal qualifications
    and associated with the banned Tudeh party, printing and publishing
    materials contrary to public morals, promoting and disseminating
    falsehoods, advertising obscene films, using objectifying images of women,

    of the Rah-e Ma refat organization which promoted a strain of mysticism
    called Eckankar . Eckankar is a novel spiritual doctrine founded in the
    United States in 1965. Eckankar followers believe that God communicates
    with human spirits by way of sound and light, and their primary aim is to
    arrive at self-knowledge and finally knowledge of God. They believe that
    when knowledge of God is achieved, the individual knower becomes an
    authentic coworker with God. Arrest and detention Following the closure of
    Rah-e Ma refat and arrest of its leaders in September/October 2015, Mr.
    Zargar and was taken into custody and transferred to Ward 209 of Evin

    is available regarding the details of the arrest. Trial Judge Abolqassem
    Salavati at the Branch 15 Revolutionary Court in Tehran tried Mr. Zargar
    across five sessions on October 16, 17, and 18 and December 11 and 12,
    2016. Apart from the Revolutionary Court, the Branch 6 Criminal Court of

    on earth by way of promoting and spreading the novel mystical sect
    Eckankar and forced rape (HRANA). Charges entered against his wife

    the regime, and membership in the Eckankar mystical sect (HRANA). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.

    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the Mr. Zargar.

    Penal Code*. Besides the Revolutionary Court s verdict, the Branch 6
    Criminal Court of Tehran Province issued separate death sentence for the
    charge of forced rape. Branch 47 of the Supreme Court upheld the death
    sentence, though it overturned the death sentence which had been issued
    for his wife. Mr. Karim Zargar was hanged at Raja ishahr Prison on January
    30, 2018. He was 64 years old. Iran Newspaper published news of his
