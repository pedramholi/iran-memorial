    Mr. Piroti had met with Ayatollah Khomeini, Ayatollah Shariatmadari, and
    Abbas Amir Enteza in August-September of 1979 to discuss about the
    massacre in Kurdistan. Information regarding the killing of Mr. Rahman
    Piroti (known as Mirza Rahman), son of Rassul and Ameneh, was obtained
    from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with a
    person close to Mr. Piroti (November 11, 2020, and March 20, 2021). News
    of this killing was also published on the Akamnews website (August 23,
    2018), on the official website of the Kurdistan Democratic Party,
    Kurdistan u Kurd (September 9, 2018), and on the Hengaw Human Rights
    Organization website (September 9, 2018). Additional information was
    obtained from the book A Pragmatic Fighter: Remembering Rahman Piroti
    (2020). Additional information was obtained through interviews conducted
    by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with Mr. Kamal Karimi, member of the
    Kurdistan Democratic Party (January 1, February 4, and March 2, 2021), Mr.
    Mansur Khosravi, member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (March 31,
    2021), and Mr. Farzin Nadimi, research fellow at the Washington Institute
    for Near East Policy (April 20, 2021). Additional information was obtained
    from the Kurdistan Democratic Party s Charter, passed in its 16thCongress
    (February 2016), Reuters News Agency (July 21, 2018), Persian Deutsche
    Welle (July 10, 1nd 22, 2018), the official website of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party, Kurdistan u Kurd (February 16, 2016; September 7, 2016;
    September 8, 2018), ISNA News Agency (September 10, and 14, 2018), and
    other sources.* Mr. Piroti was an ethnic Kurd, 66 years old, from the
    Lajan region in Piranshahr County located in West Azarbaijan Province. He
    was born in a reputable, well-known, and religious family in the Lajan
    region. Mr. Piroti dropped out of school in his senior year in high school
    due to poverty and financial problems and was not able to obtain his high
    school diploma. He was married, had five children, and did not hold any
    religious beliefs. (Boroumand Center interview, November 11, 2020). Mr.
    Piroti was known as an energetic and intellectual person in his youth. He
    was a kind and honest individual who loved reading and was extremely
    serious and determined in the defense of his rights and those of others;
    he was adored by the people around him. (Boroumand Center interview,
    November 11, 2020). According to a person close to Mr. Piroti, the killing
    of one of the leaders of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan and an
    opponent of the Pahlavi regime in the late 1960 s, and the hard life led
    by the Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party s Peshmerga who had been stranded
    and displaced in Iranian Kurdistan in 1975-76, was what inspired and
    encouraged him to engage in political activities and struggles. (Boroumand
    Center interview, November 11, 2020). According to available information,
    the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan invited Mr. Piroti to work with
    and join the Party in 1977. He officially became a member of the Party in
    early 1978, and began his political activities by participating in
    protests and demonstrations against the Pahlavi regime, as well as through
    promoting nationalist sentiments among the people of the villages around
    Piranshahr. (Boroumand Center interview, November 11, 2020). After the
    local military forces attack on the people of Naqadeh on April 20, 1979,
    and the mass murder of the population of the villages of Qarena, Qalatan,
    Sarvekani, and Sufian in the summer of 1979, Mr. Piroti and a number of
    other well-known personalities and dignitaries of the Mokrian region,
    including the counties of Mahabad and Piranshahr, met with Ayatollah
    Khomeini, Ayatollah Shariatmadari, and Abbas Amir Enteza, the Interim
    Government s spokesman in August-September of 1979. As representatives of
    the region s farmers and general population, Mr. Piroti and the others
    objective was to inform the regime s highest officials of these killings
    and prevent further attacks. (The book A Pragmatic Fighter ; Boroumand
    Center interview, March 20, 2021). Mr. Piroti began his activities as a
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan Peshmerga in April-May 1979, and was
    appointed deputy commander of a group of the Democratic Party Peshmerga
    called Avareh ( Displaced or wandering ) because of his military
    capabilities. As a military commander, he played an active role in the
    Party s military operations in certain regions of western Iran until
    spring of 1980. (The book A Pragmatic Fighter ; Boroumand Center
    interview, November 11, 2020). After the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan s 4thCongress, a number of high-ranking military commanders
    split from the Party on June 10, 1980, and founded the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party. Mr. Piroti, who had split from the Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan at the same time as these individuals, joined the
    Kurdistan Democratic Party in April-May 1981, but separated from the Party
    after less than a year due to disagreements with the Party s pol
