    After the 1979 Revolution, Mr. Mahdavi joined the Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan as a Peshmerga. In 1984-85, he was selected as the
    deputy commander of the Shahidan Verdi forces in Baneh County in Kurdistan
    Province, and became a member of the executive council of the County s
    Committee in 1986-87. In 1988-89, Mr. Mahdavi became the commander of the

    interrogations and short term detentions on numerous occasions. (Boroumand
    Center interview, December 10, 2020). Mr. Mahdavi was an empathetic,
    responsible, sociable, pleasant, and kind individual. T he Kurdish Problem
    in the Islamic Republic After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the
    disagreements between the government of the Shiite Islamic Republic and
    the organizations in the Kurdish regions of western Iran regarding the
    rights and roles of minorities in drafting the Constitution; whether the
    government should be secular or religious, and especially the issue of
    Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in Kurdish political
    organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on instituting an
    Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed, clashes between the
    central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan Democratic Party s armed
    forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini labeled the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and most influential Kurdish
    Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it unofficial and illegal ,
    and ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass executions and intense
    armed clashes continued in the region for months, clashes that resulted in
    the deaths of a number of civilians and the displacement and relocation of
    the residents of certain towns. In the next four years, Kurdish parties
    lost their grip on power in the region to a great extent, and relocated to
    Iraqi Kurdistan. Since then, a number of their leaders and members have
    been assassinated outside Iran, especially in Iraqi Kurdistan. In the
    years since the Islamic Republic has been in existence, in addition to
    such entities as the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Komala
    (Revolutionary Organization of the Toilers of Iranian Kurdistan), the
    Koran School led by Ahmad Moftizadeh, Organization of Iranian Kurdistan
