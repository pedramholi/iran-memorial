    Shahveissi (December 21, 2020), and Mr. Sivan Ezzati (February 14, 2021),
    Mr. Qaderi s wife and son. The news of this killing was also published on
    the official website of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, Kurdistan u Kurd
    (September 9, 2018) and the Kurdistan Democratic Party s archives
    (undated). Additional information was obtained through interviews
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with Mr. Kamal Karimi,
    member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (January 1, February 4, and March
    2, 2021), Mr. Mansur Khosravi, member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party
    (March 31, 2021), and Mr. Farzin Nadimi, research fellow at the Washington
    Institute for Near East Policy (April 20, 2021). Additional information
    was obtained from the Kurdistan Democratic Party s Charter, passed in its
    16thCongress (February 2016), Reuters News Agency (July 21, 2018), Persian
    Deutsche Welle (July 10, 1nd 22, 2018), the official website of the
    Kurdistan Democratic Party, Kurdistan u Kurd (February 16, 2016; September
    7, 2016; September 8, 2018), ISNA News Agency (September 10, and 14,
    2018), and other sources.* Mr. Ezzati was an ethnic Kurd, Sunni Moslem,
    married, and was born in 1957-58, in the Marivan County s village of
    Chavag, in Kurdistan Province. Mr. Ezzati was illiterate. Mr Ezzari joined
    the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan after the Islamic Revolution. He
    was then selected as platoon leader in Marivan s Zaribar Force, and then
    as company commander. In 1989-90, he was selected as brigade commander of
    the Iranian Kurdistan South, Center 2, and was transferred to the Party s
    Protection Force in 1996-97. In 2006, after the split in the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Mr. Ezzati became a member of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party. In 2011-12, he obtained the Honorary Staff Member status
    in the Kurdistan Democratic Party. Membership in the Communications
    Committee was the last position he occupied in the Kurdistan Democratic
    Party. Mr. Ezzati was wounded three times in the course of his political
    and Party activities. (Kurdistan Democratic Party Archives, Boroumand
    Center interview, February 14, 2021). Mr. Ezzati was a democratic,
    intellectual, freedom-seeking, and patriotic individual. He was very
    particular about his children s education and all of his children have
    university degrees. He loved the Kurdish people very much and his plans
    were geared toward the freedom of Kurdistan. He believed in the objectives
    of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, and had sworn he would not shave his
    beard until Kurdistan was free . (Boroumand Center interview, December 21,
    2020, and February 14, 2021). The Kurdish Problem in the Islamic Republic
    After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the disagreements between the
    government of the Shiite Islamic Republic and the organizations in the
    Kurdish regions of western Iran regarding the rights and roles of
    minorities in drafting the Constitution; whether the government should be
    secular or religious, and especially the issue of Kurdish autonomy; and
    conflicts that resulted in Kurdish political organizations boycotting the
    April 1979 Referendum on instituting an Islamic Republic; led to serious,
    and at times armed, clashes between the central government and the
    Peshmerga (Kurdistan Democratic Party s armed forces). On August 19, 1979,
    Ayatollah Khomeini labeled the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan
    (PDKI), the oldest and most influential Kurdish Party, the Party of the
    Devil , and declared it unofficial and illegal , and ordered a military
    attack on Kurdistan. Mass executions and intense armed clashes continued
    in the region for months, clashes that resulted in the deaths of a number
    of civilians and the displacement and relocation of the residents of
    certain towns. In the next four years, Kurdish parties lost their grip on
    power in the region to a great extent, and relocated to Iraqi Kurdistan.
    Since then, a number of their leaders and members have been assassinated
    outside Iran, especially in Iraqi Kurdistan. In the years since the
    Islamic Republic has been in existence, in addition to such entities as
    the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Komala (Revolutionary
    Organization of the Toilers of Iranian Kurdistan), the Koran School led by
    Ahmad Moftizadeh, Organization of Iranian Kurdistan Struggle (which was
    active in the early years of the Revolution), certain other Kurdish
    opposition parties were established outside Iran, such as the Kurdistan
    Free Life Party (PJAK) and the Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK). These
    parties, with policies and ideologies that are not necessarily similar and
    uniform, have settled in parts of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region in Iraq,
    such as Koy, Soleimanieh, and in the foothills of Qandil mountains. Some
    of these parties have undergone splits in
