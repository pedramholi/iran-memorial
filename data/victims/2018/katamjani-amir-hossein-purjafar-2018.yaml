    At three months old, he experienced an episode of high fever and severe
    seizure which resulted in loss of hearing in one ear and disability in one
    leg. Physical problems, in addition to the the treatment he received from
    school officials, had turned him into a belligerent loner. News of Mr.
    Amir Hossein Purja'far Katamjani, child of Roghieh and Habib, was
    published by Mizan News Agency (January 4, 2018) and IRNA news agency
    (January 4, 2018). Additional information about this case was obtained
    from Mizan News Agency (April 18, 2016, May 3, 2016, January 9, 2017,
    September 25, 2017, October 9, 2017), MEHR News Agency (January 9, 2017),
    ISNA news agency (September 25, 2017), Fars News Agency (April 27, 2016),
    Iran newspaper (April 17, 2016), Young Reporters Club (April 16, 2016),
    Khabar Online (October 27, 2017, February 17, 2018), Amnesty International
    website (October 13, 2017), Shahrvand newspaper (January 16, 2018), HRANA
    news agency (October 18, 2017), Rokna (January 4, 2018), Sarpush e Havades
    website (January 6, 2018), and the Islamic Consultative Assembly Research
    Center s website (May 1, 2013). Mr. Purjafar was born on December 16,
    1999, and lived with his father, mother, and three sisters in the city of
    Varamin s Kheirabad village. At three months old, he experienced an
    episode of high fever and severe seizure which resulted in loss of hearing
    in one ear and disability in one leg. According to his mother, he was
    belligerent and a loner because of his physical problem. For that reason,
    Mr. Purjafar was on medication prescribed by doctors and had to stay on
    those medications until the age of 20. Mr. Purjafar s father was not very
    close to him and was working most of the time. Mr. Purjafar had good
    relations with his older sister, and other than that, he had one close
    friend. His only friend has described him as quiet and aloof . Because of
    his personality traits, school officials separated Mr. Purjafar from other
    students and this had an immense adverse affect on him. Mr. Purjafar s
    family was therefore forced to change his school. (Khabar Online). Because
    of his personality and his living environment, Mr. Purjafar did not have
    the possibility of recreational activities, and instead, did technical
    work in his spare time. According to his mother, Amir Hossein repaired
    everything that needed to be fixed in the house . (Khabar Online). Mr.
    Purjafar s case is related to the murder of Setayesh Qoreishi, a
    6-year-old Afghan girl, on April 10, 2016, at the city of Varamin s
    Kheirabad village. International laws have strictly prohibited capital
    punishment for those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing a crime. As a party to the International Covenant on Civil and
    Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has
    the obligation not to impose capital punishment for an offence committed
    before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention On the afternoon of April
    10, 2016, someone reported the disappearance of a 6-year-old girl to the
    police. Two days later, on April 12, the police discovered the girl s body
    in the bathtub of the neighbor, Mr. Purjafar s home (Young Reporters Club)
    and Mr. Purjafar was subsequently arrested in the city of Varamin a few
    days later. Since he was 17 years old at the time of the arrest, he was
    turned over to the Reform and Rehabilitation Center, and subsequently
    transferred to Rajaishahr Prison. On April 20, 2016, a court-appointed
    lawyer was designated for Mr. Purjafar. (Mizan and IRNA news agencies,
    January 4, 2018). Mr. Purjafar had spent 20 days of his detention at Razi
    (Aminabad) Mental Hospital due the severity of his illness and his extreme
    belligerence. He had also tried to harm himself in prison on two
    occasions. According to Mr. Purjafar s father and his attorney, he spent
    20 days of his detention in January 2017, at Razi (Aminabad) Mental
    Hospital due to the severity of his illness and his extreme belligerence.
    He had also tried to harm himself in prison on two occasions. (Shahrvand
    newspaper, Sarpush-e Havades website). Mr. Purjafar s last visitation with
    his family was on the morning of January 2, 2018. Members of his family
    were not certain whether that visitation were to be the last or not.
    (Rokna). Trial Tehran Province Criminal Court One, Branch 7 tried Mr.
    Purjafar in several sessions. He had a court-appointed lawyer. According
    to available information, judicial authorities tried Mr. Purjafar out of
    turn and in a special way. In May 2016, the case was investigated at the
    City of Varamin General and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office and an
    indictment was issued less than a month later. The case was then referred
    to Tehran Province Criminal Court One, Branch 7 to go to trial. The first
    trial session was convened on September 14, 2016. According to Mr.
    Purjafar s attorney, the trial was closed door when hearing the charge of
    salacious [and unchaste] act and was open to the public regarding the
    other charges . (Mizan, Fars, IRNA, a
