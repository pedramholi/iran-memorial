    Panahi, child of Sharifeh and Mohammad Mirza, was 24 years old. He was
    born into a crowded, poor, working class family in the town of Dehgolan s
    Qaruchai village in Kurdistan Province where he obtained his high school
    diploma. Mr. Hossein Panahi had 3 sisters and 5 brothers. His family was
    active in providing help to other people, saving their lives. (Boroumand
    Center interview with Mr. Hossein Panahi s attorney, October 10, 2018).
    According to his brother, Mr. Hossein Panahi was a civil and political
    activist who was arrested by the Information Ministry agents at the age of
    16, and was tortured in order to get him to cooperate with them. After he
    completed his education, Mr. Hossein Panahi was persecuted and threatened
    by the Dehgolan and Qorveh Information Ministry agents, and he was forced
    to flee the country to Iraqi Kurdistan. He was a freedom-seeking,
    peace-loving young man with great ideals. He believed in humanity, peoples
    welfare, equality, and women s rights. He was a member of the Kurdistan
    Komeleh Party. He was traveling from Iraqi Kurdistan to the city of
    Sanandaj to visit with his father and sick mother. (Boroumand Center
    Newsletter, March 16, 2018). One of Mr. Hossein Panahi s brother s named
    Anvar, had previously been sentenced to death, his sentence subsequently
    overturned. One of his brothers is in jail, another brother died in a
    suspicious car accident, and two brothers have been forced to leave the
    country. (Boroumand Center interview with Mr. Hossein Panahi s attorney,
    October 10, 2018). Several remaining members of the Kurdistan Democratic
    Party of Iran established the Revolutionary Organization of this party in
    Iraq in the mid-1960 s. Esma il Sharifzadeh, Abdollah Mo ini, and
    Molaavareh were among the leaders of this organization who, inspired by
    the Cuban Revolution, began an armed guerrilla struggle in Kurdistan. When
    this group was defeated in 1969 and several of its members were arrested,
    armed struggle was criticized and the Maoist trend overcomes. When some of
    its leaders were released in 1978, the Revolutionary Organization of
    Working People in Kurdistan Komala was established. Based on Marxist
    theory, Komala was against the capitalists and landlords and encouraged
    workers and peasants in Kurdistan to an armed uprising against them and
    the central government. This organization considered the Kurdish
    Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI) as the rich party and campaigned against
    it, resulting in several armed conflicts and hundreds dead. In 1982,
    Komala joined another Marxist group, Sahand, which was basically a
    theoretical group, and established the Communist Party of Iran, calling
    itself the Kurdistan Organization of the Communist Party of Iran Komala .
    By the mid-1980 s, the central government was able to push Komala Pesmerga
    Forces from Kurdistan into Northern Iraq. In subsequent years, this
    organization separated from the Communist Party of Iran and faced several
    other schisms. Currently, a number of different groups use the name
    Komala. According to available information, Mr. Hossein Ahmadi Niazi, Mr.
    Hossein Panahi s attorney, was arrested because he was doing his job of
    defending his client. He was arrested for writing a communique in response
    to the Kurdistan Province Judiciary s bulletin regarding Mr. Hossein
    Panahi, and was released on a 200-million-Tuman bail. (Boroumand Center
    interview with Mr. Hossein Panahi s attorney, October 18, 2018). Several
    international human rights organizations issued announcements and
    bulletins demanding a stay of the death sentence and a fair trial for Mr.
    Hossein Panahi; they subsequently protested and strongly condemned his
    execution in further announcements. (Boroumand Center, March 16, 2018,
    Deutsche Welle, June 2, 2018, and Amnesty International, September 8,
    2018). Arrest and detention On Friday, June 23, 2017, Mr. Hossein Panah
