    He was in a very bad state of mind and had attempted suicide four times.
    News of Mr. Bakhtiar Mohammadi s execution was published in the Hengav
    website on January 3, 2018. Additional information about this case was
    obtained from the Boroumand Center s interview with his cousin, as well as
    research conducted by the Boroumand Center (February 10, 2018). Mr.
    Bakhtiar Mohammadi, child of Mahmud, was 36 years old, an adherent of
    Sunni Islam, an ethnic Kurd, married, from the town of Ravansar, and
    residing in the town of Paveh in Kermanshah Province. He had a high school
    education. He had previously been a taxi driver, but then sold his taxi
    and opened a bakery from the proceeds of that sale. According to Mr.
    Mohammadi s cousin, he was the family s second child, who, after the death
    of his father in 2003-04, was having a hard time providing for his family
    s expenses and was in a bad mental state. Mr. Mohammadi had gotten married
    in 2008-09, and had made a nice life for himself and his family through
    tremendous effort. In 2011-12, Mr. Mohammadi s wife developed lung cancer,
    and he himself, following a car accident in which he suffered substantial
    injuries, became addicted to Tramadol* which he was taking for pain, a
    pill that mentally changed him. According to the information contained in
    the Court decision, in addition to Tramadol, he also used meth. Based on
    available information, Mr. Mohammadi was a quiet man and an introvert.
    After his father s death, he became even more introverted and reclusive,
    and aside from his very close friends, had very limited interaction with
    others. Mr. Mohammadi s case is related to the murder of his pregnant
    wife. Arrest and detention Mr. Mohammadi turned himself in to the police
    in Paveh, at 6:30 AM on the morning of May 2, 2013, and stated that he had
    killed his pregnant wife. In preliminary investigations, he stated that he
    had killed his wife without a motive, that he had no issues with her, and
    that he did not intend to marry again; that he was not under the influence
    of drugs at the time of the murder, and had killed his wife simply because
    he had had enough of life. (Documents available at the Boroumand Center).
    Mr. Mohammadi turned himself in to the police and stated that he had
    murdered his wife. Mr. Mohammadi was taken to the city of Kermanshah s
    Diesel Abad Prison in June 2013. According to a person with knowledge of
    the case, he was in a very bad state of mind after the issuance of his
    sentence and had tried to commit suicide in jail by taking pills and had
    ended up being hospitalized for a week at Kermanshah s Imam Khomeini
    Prison. Mr. Mohammadi sometimes would not even go the visitation hall to
    meet with his family due to his awful mental condition. He was very
    reclusive in jail. He was incarcerated at Diesel Abad Prison for four
    years. Trial Kermanshah Province Criminal Court, Branch One, tried Mr.
    Mohammadi in two sessions, on March 10, and May 30, 2015. The trial took
    place in the presence of Mr. Mohammadi s family, the victim s attorney,
    and Mr. Mohammadi s court-appointed attorney. Based on available
    information, the next of kin s family requested the Court for Qesas of
    life for Mr. Mohammadi, along with payment of the difference in Diah, as
    well as the Diah for the unborn child (four-month-old boy). Charges Mr.
    Mohammadi was charged with the intentional murder of his pregnant wife .
    He was accused of having strangled his pregnant wife with his waist-shawl
    on May 2, 2013. Evidence of Guilt Mr. Mohammadi s admissions at various
    stages of the process were the basis for the issuance of the sentence in
    his case. The Medical Examiner s report detailing the cause of death;
    re-construction of the crime scene; recovery of the victim s body; Mr.
    Mohammadi s fingerprints on his waist-shawl as the murder weapon; and the
    Medical Examiner s report as to Mr. Mohammadi being of sound mind at the
    time of the murder and dismissing insanity; were among other evidence
    presented against him at trial. (Interview with a person with knowledge of
    the case, and documentation existing at the Boroumand Center). Defense
    Based on available information, in September 2014, Mr. Mohammadi submitted
    a brief to the court from Diesel Abad Prison, stating that he had been
    under the influence of meth** at the time of the murder and was not in a
    normal state. (Documentation existing at the Boroumand Center). According
    to Mr. Mohammadi s cousin, he had become addicted to Tramadol after his
    car accident in 2013 and had then turned to drugs, encouraged by his
    friends. (Boroumand Center interview). Based on available information, Mr.
    Mohammadi was suffering from mental problems due to issues related to his
    life, and had unsuccessfully attempted suicide several times, one of which
    was during his incarceration. According to Mr. Mohammadi, he had attempted
    suicide in 2006 by stabbing himself and had spent 15 days in the hospital.
