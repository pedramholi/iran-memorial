    The execution of Mr. Vahidollah Loqmani, along with another person, was
    reported by HRANA Website, Human Rights Activists in Iran News Agency, and
    Iran Human Rights Website (August 30. 2018). News of this execution was
    not reported by official news agencies or by the judicial system. Mr.
    Loqmani was 54 years old and a citizen of Afghanistan. His case is related
    to murder and illegal drugs crimes in 1998. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Loqmani spent 22 years in prison. On August 28, 2018, he was transferred
    from the foreign nationals section of Qezel Hesar Prison in Karaj to
    solitary confinement in Raja i Shahr Prison. At the time of the transfer

    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Loqmani
    s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Loqmani was crimes related
    to illegal drugs (HRANA). According to Iran Human Rights website, he was
    charged with murder in the first degree . The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence provided against Mr.
    Loqmani was arms possession . Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Loqmani s defense. Judgment Mr. Loqmani was sentenced to death by hanging.
