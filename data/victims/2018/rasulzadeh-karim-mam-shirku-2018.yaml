    (January 1, February 4, and March 2, 2021), Mr. Mansur Khosravi, member of

    Reuters News Agency (July 21, 2018), Persian Deutsche Welle (July 10, 1nd
    22, 2018), the official website of the Kurdistan Democratic Party,
    Kurdistan u Kurd (February 16, 2016; September 7, 2016; September 8,
    2018), ISNA News Agency (September 10, and 14, 2018), and other sources.*
    Mr. Rasulzadeh was an ethnic Kurd, married, born in 1962-63, in the town
    of Rabt s village of Vatmanaveh in West Azarbaijan Province. He had a
    middle school (eighth grade) education. Between the years 1971 and 1977,
    Mr. Rasulzadeh was captain of the Sardasht football (soccer) team and was
    voted the best football player in western Iran. After the 1979 Revolution,
    Mr. Rasulzadeh joined the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan. In
    1980-81, security forces detained Mr. Rasulzadeh for a few months for his
    Party activities. In 1981-82, he joined the Mineshem Force s Second
    Company, and was elected as a political staff member in 1989-90. In
    1991-92, Mr. Rasulzadeh was elected member of the Democratic Party s
    Committee in the town of Rabt. After the split in the Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan in 2006, he became a member of the Kurdistan Democratic
    Party. His last positions and duties in the Kurdistan Democratic Party
    were membership in the Party s Security Committee, working in the new
    Peshmerga Admission Section and settling them and their families in the
    Party s camps. (Kurdistan Democratic Parti archives). Mr. Rasulzadeh was a
    decent, honest, kind, resourceful individual with many ideas. He strongly
    believed in the Kurdistan Democratic Party s goals and ideology, and his
    biggest wish was for the Democratic Party to re-unite. (Boroumand Center
    interview, February 2, 2021). The Kurdish Problem in the Islamic Republic
    After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the disagreements between the
    government of the Shiite Islamic Republic and the organizations in the
    Kurdish regions of western Iran regarding the rights and roles of
    minorities in drafting the Constitution; whether the government should be
    secular or religious, and especially the issue of Kurdish autonomy; and
    conflicts that resulted in Kurdish political organizations boycotting the
    April 1979 Referendum on instituting an Islamic Republic; led to serious,
    and at times armed, clashes between the central government and the
    Peshmerga (Kurdistan Democratic Party s armed forces). On August 19, 1979,
    Ayatollah Khomeini labeled the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan
    (PDKI), the oldest and most influential Kurdish Party, the Party of the
    Devil , and declared it unofficial and illegal , and ordered a military
    attack on Kurdistan. Mass executions and intense armed clashes continued
    in the region for months, clashes that resulted in the deaths of a number
    of civilians and the displacement and relocation of the residents of
    certain towns. In the next four years, Kurdish parties lost their grip on
    power in the region to a great extent, and relocated to Iraqi Kurdistan.
    Since then, a number of their leaders and members have been assassinated
    outside Iran, especially in Iraqi Kurdistan. In the years since the
    Islamic Republic has been in existence, in addition to such entities as
    the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Komala (Revolutionary
    Organization of the Toilers of Iranian Kurdistan), the Koran School led by
    Ahmad Moftizadeh, Organization of Iranian Kurdistan Struggle (which was
    active in the early years of the Revolution), certain other Kurdish
    opposition parties were established outside Iran, such as the Kurdistan
    Free Life Party (PJAK) and the Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK). These
    parties, with policies and ideologies that are not necessarily similar and
    uniform, have settled in parts of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region in Iraq,
    such as Koy, Soleimanieh, and in the foothills of Qandil moun
