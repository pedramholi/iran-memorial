    Mr. Ebrahimi thoroughly believed in freedom of speech and democracy, and
    the plight of the Kurdish people was his main concern. Information
    regarding the killing of Mr. Ebrahim Ebrahimi, also known as Ebrahim
    Zivieh ee, son of Qader and Aisha, was obtained from an interview
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with Ms. Kajal Azizi, Mr.
    Ebrahimi s wife (December 20, 2020, and May 20, 2021). The news of this
    killing was also published on the Akam News website (September 9, 2018),
    on the official website of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, Kurdistan u
    Kurd (September 9, 2018), the Kurdistan Democratic Party s archives
    (undated), and on the Hengaw Human Rights Organization website (September
    9, 2018). Additional information was obtained through interviews conducted
    by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with Mr. Kamal Karimi, member of the
    Kurdistan Democratic Party (January 1, February 4, and March 2, 2021), Mr.
    Mansur Khosravi, member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (March 31,
    2021), and Mr. Farzin Nadimi, research fellow at the Washington Institute
    for Near East Policy (April 20, 2021). Additional information was obtained
    from the Kurdistan Democratic Party s Charter, passed in its 16thCongress
    (February 2016), Reuters News Agency (July 21, 2018), Persian Deutsche
    Welle (July 10, 1nd 22, 2018), the official website of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party, Kurdistan u Kurd (February 16, 2016; September 7, 2016;
    September 8, 2018), ISNA News Agency (September 10, and 14, 2018), and
    other sources.* Mr. Ebrahimi was born on May 30, 1962, in Sardasht County
    s village of Zivieh in West Azarbaijan Province. He was an ethnic Kurd,
    married, and held a high school diploma with a concentration on natural
    sciences. He finished elementary school in his village and went to
    Sardasht to continue his education. Prior to the 1979 Islamic Revolution,
    he became a member of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan s Youth
    Union in Sardasht when he was 17 years old and still in high school, and
    became secretly active by participating in anti-government demonstrations
    and engaging in propaganda [activities] through printing and distributing
    books, pamphlets, and Party announcements regarding Kurdistan issues. In
    his last year of high school, Mr. Ebrahimi intended to officially become a
    Peshmerga; one of his friends, however, encouraged him to continue his
    studies. In 1979-80, Mr. Ebrahimi officially became a member of the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan as a Peshmerga. (Boroumand Center
    interview, December 20, 2020; the Party s archives). After going through
    training for the treatment of the war wounded and patients, Mr. Ebrahimi
    became part of the medical treatment personnel between 1981 and 1983-84.
    He then became part of the political personnel and was a member of the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan s Sardasht Committee from 1983 to
    1989-90. From 2006 onward, and after the split in the Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan, he became a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party.
    Starting in 2007-08, he was the latter Party s person in charge of the
    Political Military Committee and a member of the Party s Leadership
    Council for two years. From 2011-12 to 2018-19, he was the person in
    charge of the Kurdistan Democratic Party s Mission in the city of Erbil.
    (Boroumand Center interview, May 20, 2021). Mr. Ebrahimi was a quiet,
    ethical, sociable, and kind family man and was very frank. He thoroughly
    believed in freedom of speech and democracy, and the plight of the Kurdish
    people was his main concern. (Boroumand Center interview, December 20,
    2020). The Kurdish Problem in the Islamic Republic After the 1979 Islamic
    Revolution, the disagreements between the government of the Shiite Islamic
    Republic and the organizations in the Kurdish regions of western Iran
    regarding the rights and roles of minorities in drafting the Constitution;
    whether the government should be secular or religious, and especially the
    issue of Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in Kurdish
    political organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on
    instituting an Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed,
    clashes between the central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan
    Democratic Party s armed forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini
    labeled the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and
    most influential Kurdish Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it
    unofficial and illegal , and ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass
    executions and intense armed clashes continued in the region for months,
    clashes that resulted in the deaths of a number of civilians and the
    displacement and relocation of the residents of certain towns. In the next
    four years, Kurdish parties lost their grip on power in the region to a
    great extent, and relocated to Iraqi Kurdistan. Since then, a number of
    their leaders and members have been assassinated outside Iran, especially
    in Iraqi Kurdistan. In the years since the
