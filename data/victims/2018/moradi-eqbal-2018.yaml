    In the last decade of his life, Mr. Moradi had come to believe that human
    rights activities, including publication and dissemination of news, and
    correspondence with the United Nations and human rights organizations,
    were more effective than armed struggle and armed activities, and was
    working with political and human rights organizations to that end.
    Information regarding the murder of Mr. Eqbal Moradi, son of Kaleh and
    Hossein, was obtained through interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center with Ms. Ameneh Qaderi, Mr. Moradi s spouse (November 7,
    2020) and with Mr. Sa eed Sanandaji, Mr. Moradi s friend and colleague
    (March 16, 2021), and through Mr. Moradi s testimony with Iran Human
    Rights Documentation Center (January 8, 2013). The news was also published
    in Kurdistan Human Rights Network (July 19, 2018) and the Campaign to
    Defend Civil and Political Prisoners in Iran (July 18, 2018). Additional
    information about this case was obtained from Kurdistan Human Rights
    Network (July 20 and 24, 2018), Eqbal Moradi s interview with the Human
    Rights Watch (December 7, 2014), Tehran General and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor s Office s Official Website (September 8, 2018), Human Rights
    Activists in Iran s News Agancy, HRANA (June 25, 2018), BBC Persian
    website (July 19, 2018), Deutsche Welle website (July 20, 2018), Kurdistan
    Human Rights Association (July 18, 2018), and Rafio Zamaneh website (July
    18, 2018). Mr. Moradi was a 57-year-old ethnic Kurd, born in the town of
    Marivan s village of Hajmne in Kurdistan Province. He was married and had
    two children. He was an adherent of the Shafe i branch of Sunni Islam. At
    the age of 6, Mr. Moradi went to the town of Marivan from his village in
    order to go to school, where he obtained his high school diploma. He was
    among the first people to join the Komala Party* upon its establishment in
    Marivan in 1979-80, and was active in the Party as a Peshmerga until
    1982-83. He worked in the town of Marivan as a house painter and decorator
    for a time. (Boroumand Center interview, November 7, 2020). From
    approximately 2001-02, Mr. Moradi resided in the city of Panjwen in Iraqi
    Kurdistan. According to Mr. Sa eed Sanandaji, Mr. Moradi s friend and
    colleague, Mr. Moradi had chosen Panjwen because of its proximity to
    Marivan and the possibility of conducting political activities there, his
    personal liking for the town, low living expenses, and the possibility of
    making a living in that region. He worked in the town of Panjwen as a
    street vendor and he would sometimes travel to the Iran-Iraq border in
    order to purchase various goods. (Boroumand Center interview, March 16,
    2021; Iran Human Rights Documentation Center). Starting in 2010, Mr.
    Moradi started to work with the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK)** in the
    human rights realm, but was not officially a member of the Party.
    (Boroumand Center interview, March 16, 2021). According to Mr. Sanandaji,
    Mr. Moradi was a patriotic man and Kurdistan s independence was extremely
    important to him. Since the mid-2000 s, Mr. Moradi had come to believe
    more in the effectiveness of human rights activities, including
    publication and dissemination of news and correspondence with the United
    Nations and human rights organizations, rather than armed struggle and
    armed activities. In an interview with Iran Human Rights Documentation
    Center, Mr. Moradi stated: My activities were more political than
    military, and it just consisted of giving interviews, reading books, etc.
    (Boroumand Center interview, November 7, 2020, and March 16, 2021; Iran
    Human Rights Documentation Center, January 8, 2013). Mr. Moradi was a
    reputable human rights activist in Kurdistan, and played an integral part
    in initiating the Campaign to Defend Civil and Political Prisoners since
    2008-09 until his death, as well as in initiating various campaigns and
    gatherings in Iraqi Kurdistan in upholding human rights, opposing the
    death penalty, and reporting news regarding political prisoners and
    refugees to the media. In 2010-11, he became a member of the Kurdistan
    Human Rights Association and was a member of that human rights
    organization s executive council. (Campaign to Defend Civil and Political
    Prisoners, July 18, 2018; Boroumand Center interview, March 16, 2021). The
    Kurdistan Human Rights Association was established in 2005 in Sweden and
    is active in the human rights realm in Kurdistan. This Association also
    has official branches in Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland, and South
    Kurdistan (Iraqi Kurdistan). (Kurdistan Human Rights Association, July 18,
    2018). Mr. Moradi was an empathetic, quiet, modest, and rather shy
    individual, who kept his promises and was open to criticism. According to
    his wife, he loved to fish. (Boroumand Center interview, November 7, 2020,
    and March 16, 2021). Prison and Self-imposed Exile Mr. Moradi spent
    approximately 6 years in Orumieh, Sanandaj, Marivan, and Tabriz prisons
    because of his political and party activities in Kurdistan since the onset
