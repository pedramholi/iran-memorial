    Reuters News Agency (July 21, 2018), Persian Deutsche Welle (July 10, 1nd
    22, 2018), the official website of the Kurdistan Democratic Party,

    Mr. Azizpur was an ethnic Kurd, single, born in 1998-99, in Baneh County
    located in Kurdistan Province. His father passed away when he was 9 months
    old. He had to quit high school in his sophomore year due to his family s
    dire financial conditions. (Boroumand Center interview, April 25, 2021).
    Mr. Azizpur was drawn to political and party activities because of Iran s,
    and especially Kurdistan s, [dire] economic and political situation, and
    the protest demonstrations in the 2010 s. (Boroumand Center interview,
    April 4, 2021). In 2014-15, at the age of 16, he joined the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party as a Peshmerga. (Party archives). Mr. Azizpur was active
    in the Party s security and Shakh (mountain) Committees. He was also
    active as staff member and commander in the Kurdistan Democratic Party s
    Political Office Protection and Security Force. (Party archives). Mr.
    Azizpur was a smart and active individual who loved learning and getting
    ahead, especially in Party activities. He was extremely popular and
    trustworthy, and was a great role model for his friends within the Party
    as well as outside. (Boroumand Center interview, April 25, 2021). The
    Kurdish Problem in the Islamic Republic After the 1979 Islamic Revolution,
    the disagreements between the government of the Shiite Islamic Republic
    and the organizations in the Kurdish regions of western Iran regarding the
    rights and roles of minorities in drafting the Constitution; whether the
    government should be secular or religious, and especially the issue of
    Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in Kurdish political
    organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on instituting an
    Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed, clashes between the
    central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan Democratic Party s armed
    forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini labeled the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and most influential Kurdish
    Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it unofficial and illegal ,
    and ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass executions and intense
    armed clashes continued in the region for months, clashes that resulted in
    the deaths of a number of civilians and the displacement and relocation of
    the residents of certain towns. In the next four years, Kurdish parties
    lost their grip on power in the region to a great extent, and relocated to
    Iraqi Kurdistan. Since then, a number of their leaders and members have
    been assassinated outside Iran, especially in Iraqi Kurdistan. In the
    years since the Islamic Republic has been in existence, in addition to
    such entities as the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Komala
    (Revolutionary Organization of the Toilers of Iranian Kurdistan), the
    Koran School led by Ahmad Moftizadeh, Organization of Iranian Kurdistan
    Struggle (which was active in the early years of the Revolution), certain
    other Kurdish opposition parties were established outside Iran, such as
    the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) and the Kurdistan Freedom Party
    (PAK). These parties, with policies and ideologies that are not
    necessarily similar and uniform, have settled in parts of the Kurdistan
    Autonomous Region in Iraq, such as Koy, Soleimanieh, and in the foothills
    of Qandil mountains. Some of these parties have undergone splits in recent
    years. These conflicts have been more about the methods of running the
    organizations rather than theoretical and ideological differences. These
    parties have not controlled any part of the Iranian territory since the
    late 1980 s, and have adopted d
