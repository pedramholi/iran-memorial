    The execution of Mr. B.A., along with one other person, was reported by
    the Ministry of Justice of Mazandaran Province, HRANA, the Human Rights
    Activists News Agency, Sari Khabar, and Fars News Agency Websites, quoting
    the Public Relations Department of the Ministry of Justice of Mazandaran
    Province (January 8, 2018). The case of Mr. B.A. and one other person is
    related to a murder. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. B.A. s

    the other defendant was murder in the first degree . He and the other
    defendant had killed a person. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. B.A. s defense. Judgment The Criminal Court of Mazandaran
    Province sentenced Mr. B.A. to death by hanging. This sentence was
    approved by the Supreme Court and the head of the Judiciary. He and the
    other person were executed in Sari Prison on January 8, 2018.
