    The execution of Mr. Salman Khodayari was reported by the Iran Human
    Rights Website, and HRANA Human Rights Activists News Agency (July 23,
    2018). The official news agencies did not report on this execution, Mr.
    Khodayari was from Borujerd, and his case is related to a murder that
    happened in 2012. Arrest and detention Mr. Khodayari was arrested in 2012,
    at the time of the incident, and he spent five years and eight months
    imprisoned in Borujerd and Shirvan. He was taken to solitary confinement
    on July 21, 2018. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Khodayari s trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Khodayari was murder in the first degree .
    He killed someone during a tribal altercation. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Khodayari. Defense No information is available on Mr. Khodayari s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Salman Khodayari was sentenced to death by hanging. He was
    executed on Sunday, July 22, 2018, in the Shirvan Prison. The family of
    the victim agreed to commute the death sentence in exchange for blood
    money, but inter-tribal problems precluded this arrangement.
