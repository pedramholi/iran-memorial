    2018; Iran Wire, January 15, 2018). Mr. Qahremani had become engaged to be
    married a short while before the winter of 2018. (Radio Farda, January 14,
    2018; Kayhan London, January 16, 2018). This case is related to Mr.
    Qahremani s death in detention. Nationwide Protests Popular public
    protests began on Thursday, December 28, 2018. On the first day, thousands
    of people in Mashhad, Kashmar, Birjand, and Neishabur in Khorassan Razavi
    Province participated in the No To Rising Prices demonstrations. In videos
    of these demonstrations disseminated online in social networks and in the
    media, the protestors also chanted slogans against several of the country
    s leaders. On the second day, protests spread to other cities in Iran
    including Esfahan, Shiraz, Tabriz, Rasht, Sari, Ghouchan, Sabzevar, and
    Khorramabad, and the protestors slogans turned against the institutions of
    the Islamic republic and the Leader of the Revolution himself. With the
    city of Qom joining other protesting cities, slogans were chanted in
    support of Reza Shah Phalavi. On the third day, simultaneous with
    government sponsored demonstrations celebrating Dey 9th(December 30) in
    Tehran s Mosalla ( Prayer Place ), protests continued across Iran in
    Kermanshah, Dezful, Karaj s Gohardasht Neighborhood, Rasht, Arak, Shiraz,
    Shar-e Kord, Khorramabad, Zanjan, Bandar Abbas, Semnan, and Hashtgerd,
    with skirmishes breaking out between protestors and government forces. On
    December 31, 2018, protests continued in Tehran, Mashhad, Kermanshah,
    Rasht, Arak, Tabriz, Maragheh, Behshahr, Chahbahar, Hashtgerd, Orumieh,
    Dorud, amd Malayer. Iranian Television reported the death of 10 people in
    the protests, and [the town of] Izeh s representative announced 2
    individuals had been killed in that town. Hamedan Governor s office also
    reported the death of 3 people. In a cabinet meeting, Iranian President
    Hassan Rohani addressed the protests for the first time and while
    reiterating the people s right to peaceful protests, stated that the
    government would not tolerate chaos and disorder. On the fifth day,
    January 1, 2018, the protests became more violent, with a police precinct
    in the town of Qahdarijan in Esfahan Province set ablaze, following which
    6 people were killed. Sanandaj was one of the cities that was home to
    public protests from the first days. Dozens of people were arrested during
    these protests, at least four of who, were killed in the city s detention
    centers. (2) Seven days after the protests began, the regime s supporters
    started demonstrations in various cities at the government s invitation,
    and condemned the popular protests. On that same day, even though smaller
    protests occurred in several cities, the protests generally began to
    subside. Social networking apps, Instagram and Telegram were filtered
    during the protests and the filtering of Telegram continued after they
    were over. From the time nationwide protests began, until its one year
    anniversary in December 2018-January 2019, Iranian government officials
    reacted differently to the events, ranging from ascribing it to internal
    political competition between various groups, to announcing a foreign
    enemy as the culprit. Protests against economic conditions are ongoing and
    have intensified in recent months with labor strikes in a number of
    factories, including Ahvaz Steel Factory, and Neyshekar Haft Tappeh
    Factory (Haft Tappeh Sugar Cane Factory). Mr. Qahremani s Death According
    to information published Mr. Qahremani s family and persons close to him,
    he disappeared on January 2ndor 3rd, 2018. They believe Mr. Qahremani was
    in Sanandaj Information Administration detention for approximately the
    following 10 days. (Iran Wire, January 15, 2018; HRANA, January 20, 2018;
    Kayhan London, January 16). Mr. Qahremani disappeared on January 2, 2018,
    and his body was turned over to his family on January 13, 2018. Even
    though the authorities stated that he had been killed in armed skirmishes
    unrelated to the nationwide protests, there are no bullet wounds in his
    body, but there are bruises caused by severe beatings. Ac
