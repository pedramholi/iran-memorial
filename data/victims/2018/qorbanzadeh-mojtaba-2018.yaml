    News of Mr. Mojtaba Qorbanzadeh s execution was published on the website
    of Mizan News Agency and ISNA News Agency, and in Iran newspaper. (April
    10, 2018). Additional information about this case was obtained from
    IRIB-Gilan Province website (October 17, 18, and 22, 2017; November 23,
    2017; January 16, and 28, 2018; February 6, 2018); Sarpush (November 29,
    2017); Aftab News (October 18, 2017); Gil Negah (November 29, 2017); ISNA
    (October 18, and 21, 2017); and Borna News Agency (November 19, 2017).
    According to available information, Mr. Qorbanzadeh was 28 years old,
    married, with one child from his first marriage. He was employed at a
    pharmacy in the city of Rasht. His case is related to sex crimes,
    pedophilia, and murder on October 14, 2017, in Rasht. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Qorbnzadeh was arrested in Rasht s Lakan region by the Police within
    the first moments after the incident. He spent six months in prison.
    According to the Defendant, he was tortured while undergoing
    interrogations. (Gil Negah website, November 29, 2017). Trial Gilan
    Province Criminal Court One tried Mr. Qorbanzadeh on November 29, 2017,
    after 43 days spent in detention, with a single judge, and in the presence
    of his court-appointed attorney. The court convened two public sessions
    for the charge of murder, and one closed door session for the charge of
    pedophilia. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Qorbanzadeh were
    intentional murder, forcible Tafkhid (sodomy without penetration),
    molesting a child, and drinking alcohol . After molesting the child, the
    defendant banged the child s head against the wall, thereby causing the
    two years and eight months old child s death. Mr. Qorbanzadeh was the
    child s stepfather. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence used against
    Mr. Qorbanzadeh was the child s death due to blunt force to the head; the
    Defendant s confession; signs of injury to the child s head, ear, bruised
    chin, testicles, and anus; the Medical Examiner s report; the child s
    parents complaint; and the testimony of eyewitnesses . In his confession,
    Mr. Qorbanzadeh stated that Satan had taken him over at the time of the
    commission of the crime, and he expressed regret and remorse. (IRIB-Gilan
    Province website, October 18, 2017). International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense In his defense,
    Mr. Qorbanzadeh stated that he did not accept the charges. He continued: I
    was traumatized and I had been tortured so much that I had to confess.
    What do you think, that I m not a human being? That I do not have a shred
    of human decency? I do, and I was raised well by my parents; I would never
    rape a child. I was severely beaten the first eight nights I spent in
    detention at the Criminal Investigations Bureau. They refused to even give
    me water for three days. They would tell me they would turn me over to the
    angry mob of people if I didn t confess, and that the mob would do what
    was necessary and take care of me. (Gil Negah website, November 29, 2017).
    He stated that he was the one who had taken the child to the hospital, and
    had refused to flee like Ahura s mother s had suggested, because he
    believed he had done nothing wrong. In Mr. Qorbanzadeh s defense, his
    attorney stated that the murder of the child was unintentional and asked
    for forgiveness. He also made a request to the court asking that his
    client s statements be viewed as admissions under duress. (Gil Negah
    website, November 29, 2017). Judgment On December 7, 2017, Gilan Province
    Criminal Court One sentenced Mr. Ali Qorbanzadeh to death for murder, to
    100 lashes and 2 years exile on the charge of forcible Takhfid (sodomy
    without penetration), to 6 months in prison for child molestation and
    payment of Arsh*, and to 80 lashes on the charge of drinking alcohol. The
    sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court and approved by the Head of the
    Judiciary Branch on February 6, 2018. Mr. Qorbanzadeh was hanged at Rasht
    Prison in the morning of April 10, 2018. ------------------------------
