    who distributed foreign currency in the market as a trustee of the Central
    Bank, was charged with corruption and disruption of the country s
    financial, tried and executed in an extremely hasty fashion. News of the
    execution of Mr. Mohammad Esma il Qasemi, child of Gholamali, along with
    another individual ( Mr. Vahid Mazlumin ), was published in Tehran General
    and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office News Website on November 14, 2018.
    Additional information about this case was obtained from Mizan News Agency
    (October 5, 2018, and November 14 and 15, 2018), Fars News Agency
    (November 28, 2018), and Mehr News Agency (November 14, 2018) websites.
    Mr. Qasemi was born on 1973, and resided in Tehran. Since 1994, he was in
    the business of buying and selling foreign currency and gold coins under
    the nickname of Mohammad Salem. In 2011 and 2012-13, he distributed
    imported foreign currency from Dubai in the market as a trustee of the
    Central Bank (Mizan News Agency- November 14, 2018). Mr. Qasemi had been
    summoned once in 2012, as one of the principal elements and agents of
    disruption and disarray in the country s currency system. However, the
    Central Bank intervened on his behalf and announced that he was an agent
    and contact of the Central Bank; he was thus acquitted of the charges
    against him (Mizan News Agency- October 5, 2018 and Mehr News Agency). Mr.
    Qasemi was in the business of buying and selling foreign currency and gold
    coins under the nickname of Mohammad Salem. Mr. Qasemi s case was related
    to financial crimes committed in 2018 in Tehran. Arrest and detention
    There is no information about the details of Mr. Qasemi s arrest and
    detention. Trial Tehran Islamic Revolutionary Court, Branch Two, reserved
    for cases of financial corruption, tried Mr. Qasemi and 14 other
    individuals in the case. The first trial session convened at 10 AM on
    Saturday, September 8, 2018. The trial was public and the defendants
    attorneys were in attendance (Tehran General and Revolutionary Prosecutor
    s Office News Website, Mizan News Agency, Mehr News Agency). No further
    information is available on other trail sessions. Charges Mr. Qasemi s
    charge was Efsad fel-Arz ( spreading corruption on Earth ) through
    establishing and heading a network of corruption and disruption of the
    country s financial, foreign currency, and monetary system, by performing
    illegal and unauthorized transactions and wholesale traffic of currency
    from the country on a large scale (Court Decision issued by the Special
    Tribunal for Financial Corruption, Branch Two, Fars News Agency).
    According to the Court Decision issued against Mr. Qasemi, he was one of
    the closest people to Mr. Vahid Mazlumin, the principal individual of a
    network called the Vahid Mazlumin Network , which engaged in large scale
    sale and purchase of foreign currency and gold coins. About 170,000
    transactions had been carried out in 219 bank accounts in this network,
    reportedly totaling 14 thousand billion tumans. According to official
    reports, the members of this network had inflamed the foreign currency and
    gold coin markets through wholesale and large scale transactions on paper
    and futures transactions. One of the other actions they had engaged in was
    illegally taking funds out of the country (Tehran General and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office News Website). According to the Court,
    Mr. Qasemi was very close to the principal individual of a network called
    the Vahid Mazlumin Network , which engaged in large scale sale and
    purchase of foreign currency and gold coins. Mr. Qasemi was accused of
    engaging in the traffic of foreign currency and hence causing major
    disruptions and chaos in the country s monetary and foreign currency
    systems, in spite of the fact that he knew full well what economic
    conditions the country was in and what crises, issues, and hardships had
    been caused by sanctions and the resulting shortage of the country s
    currency sources. He did this in spite of several prior arrests, and
    knowing full well the criminal nature of his actions and the destructive
    consequences of his illegal activities, and knowing full well the
    effectiveness such actions had in opposing and undermining the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Individuals who have been investigated have unanimously
    alluded to Vahid Mazlumin s rente (French word, in its current usage in
    Persian meaning abuse of privileged position, situation, and information
    for financial gain ) and his relations with the officials of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran s Central Bank and/or certain government officials (Court
    Decision issued by the Special Tribunal for Financial Corruption, Branch
    Two, Fars News Agency). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
