    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein S. and another individual named Mr.
    Hossein D. was published on the Golestan Province Judiciary website and on
    Mizan and Fars News Agencies websites (May 12, 2018), quoting the Head of
    Golestan Province Judiciary. Additional information about this case was
    obtained from Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) News Agency s
    website (April 7, 2018), Saten website (September 8, 2017), Islamic
    Republic News Agency IRNA (September 7, 2017), Jam-e Jam Online (August
    12, 13, 15 and 16, 2015), Young Journalists Club s website (August 13,
    2015), Fars News Agency s website (August 12, 2015), and Iran newspaper
    (August 13, 2015). Mr. Hossein S. Was married and had children. He lived
    in Gonbad-e Kavus and used to work as a daily laborer. Mr. Hossein S. was
    once arrested I near Bojnord in 1999, charged with carrying drugs, and
    sentenced to life in prison. The case of Mr. Hossein S. and 16 other
    individuals, known as the Serial Murders is related to murders and armed
    robberies committed in Golestan and Mazandaran Provinces between 2000 and
    2015. Arrest and detention Mr. Hossein D. and his sons had talked about
    their cooperation with Hossein S. while being interrogated that led the
    police to identify him. Trial Gorgan Islamic Revolutionary Court tried Mr.
    Hossein S. and the other defendants in the case in 2016. (Fars News Agency
    May 12, 2018). Mr. Hossein S. s case and that of the other defendants was
    referred to the Province Criminal Court for a hearing on the private law
    aspect of the charges of murder and robbery. (IRNA, September 7, 2017). No
    information is available regarding the trial session(s). Charges The Head
    of Golestan Province Judiciary stated the charges against Mr. Hossein
    (Akbar) D. and the other defendants in the case as 13 counts of murder and
    80 counts of armed robbery . According to available information, the
    defendants were armed when they were stealing automobiles or farming
    equipment, and shot and killed individuals while committing these
    felonies. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt Evidence brought against Mr. Hossein S.
    were confessions of the other defendants, testimonies of the victims,
    holding a criminal record, possession of arms, and complaints of the
    victims families . International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Hossein S. s defense. A Summary of the Legal Defects in the
    Adjudication of Mr. Hossein S. The defendant in this case was sentenced to
    death on the charge of Moharebeh ( waging war against God ) and Efsad
    fel-Arz ( spreading corruption on Earth ) through the commission of armed
    robbery and murder. The sentence was issued by the revolutionary court;
    the defendant s case regarding murder and armed robbery, however, was
    assigned to the criminal court. In accordance with Iranian law, Moharebeh
    occurs when a person takes up arms with the intention of disrupting public
    safety and security and creating fear and apprehension in the populace,
    and in doing so, does deprive a large number of individuals of their
    safety and security. Not any armed criminal act is considered to be
    Moharebeh; Articles 651 and 652 of the Islamic Penal Code provide for
    incarceration as the punishment for armed robbery. The law has therefore
    provided for the act of armed robbery as a separate crime and does not
    consider it to be Moharebeh. Armed robbery could constitute Moharebeh if
    it is done continuously and in the form of a group, and in such a way as
    to disrupt public safety and security for a majority of the populace. In
    this case, however, the robberies did not rise to a level where they would
    constitute Moharebeh. It is natural to assert that society s safety and
    security is jeopardized with the commission of any crime; what the crime
    of Moharebeh has in mind, however, is that public safety and security be
    disrupted in an extensive manner. The other issue is the charge of murder.
    Although the punishment for intentional murder is Qesas ( retribution ),
    the murder victim s next of kin have the right, however, to forgive [the
    murderer] and forego Qesas; the crime of murder cannot be put forth in the
    framework of Moharebeh, which is a crime subject to Hadd punishment and
    not subject to forgiveness. For this reason, it appears that trying the
    defendant s case in the revolutionary court and on the charge of Moharebeh
    was contrary to existing laws. Judgment [The city of] Gorgan Islamic
    Revolutionary Court found Mr. Hossein S. Mofsed fel-Arz and Mohareb , and
    sentenced him to death. The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court. Mr.
    Hossein S. and another individual
