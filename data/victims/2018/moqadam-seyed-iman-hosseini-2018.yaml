    News of the execution of Mr. Seyed Iman Hosseini Moqadam, child of Seyed
    Reza, was published on the websites of Mizan News Agency, HRANA (the news
    arm of the Human Rights Activists in Iran), and Fars News Agency. (April
    30, 2018). Additional information about this case was obtained from Mr.
    Hosseini Moqadam s interview with Iran Human Rights Organization and from
    his mother s letter published in the Iran Human Rights Organization
    website (November 27, and December 3, 2017), Fars News Agency website
    (February 2, 2016), IRNA (the Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency)
    (February 2, 2016), and Mizan News Agency (March 3, 2015). Mr. Hosseini
    Moqadam had two wives and two children and was involved in construction
    and car sales. His case, known as the case of the fake mailman , is
    related to sexual offenses and theft in June-July 2012. Arrest and
    detention At 10 PM on December 30, 2013, the detectives from Greater
    Tehran s Criminal Investigations Bureau s 16th Precinct arrested Mr.
    Hossini Moqadam at her mother s home located in a village in [the town of]
    Some ehsara in Gilan Province. He was then taken to Shapur [Precinct]
    Criminal Investigations Bureau [in Tehran]. (Fars News Agency, April 30,
    2018). According to available information, Mr. Hosseini Moqadam was sought
    out after complaints were lodged by a number of women to the effect that
    they had been sexually assaulted and robbed. As the police were taking
    action across the city of Tehran in order to find and arrest Mr. Hosseini
    Moqadam, a young woman called the Police 110 (the equivalent of 911) and
    stated that she had seen the defendant at a recreational center in Tehran.
    She also stated that the defendant had sexually assaulted her under the
    pretext of delivering a postal package. Looking at footage from closed
    circuit cameras around the young woman s residence, the detectives were
    able to see the defendant s motorcycle as he was fleeing the scene and
    determine the identity of the last owner, who turned out to be the
    defendant. (Fars News Agency, April 30, 2018). According to Mr. Hosseini
    Moqadam, he was tortured for 70 days at the Shahpur Criminal
    Investigations Bureau. He weighed 123 kilograms (271 pounds) when he was
    taken to the Criminal Investigations Bureau and weighed only 78 kilograms
    (171 pounds) when he left there and was transferred to prison. He stated:
    The torture was so awful that if you look at the video of me talking when
    I was at the Criminal Investigations Bureau, you will notice that I passed
    out several times and slipped from my chair. I was delirious. (Iran Human
    Rights Organization, January 26, 2018). Furthermore, his mother s letter
    states: The torture was so intense that when my son was at Tehran
    Prosecutor s Office Branch 21, he wanted to jump from the building to free
    himself from the torture, but the officers saved him at the very last
    minute. (Mr. Hosseini Moqadam s mother s letter, Iran Human Rights
    Organization, December 3. 2017). Mr. Hosseini Moqadam spent 5 years in
    prison. On April 22, 2018, he was transferred from Gohardasht Prison s
    (Rajaishahr Prison) Ward 1 to a solitary confinement cell. (HRANA, April
    30, 2018). Trial Tehran Islamic Revolutionary Court, Branch 15 tried Mr.
    Hosseini Moqadam in several sessions in the presence of the judge and his
    defense attorney. The first trial session took place on October 28, 2014
    (IRNA, February 2, 2016) Charges The charge brought Mr. Hosseini Moqadam
    was 30 counts of forcible rape . According to the contents of the case
    file, several women went to Shohada [District] 110th Police Precinct and
    stated that a person who identified himself as a mailman had rung their
    doorbell under the pretext of delivering a package, and had subsequently
    stolen their necklaces and other personal items by threatening them with a
    knife or a carpet cutting blade; some also stated that he had sexually
    assaulted them. Several of the women also stated that he had fled the
    scene on a black motorcycle. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence used against Mr. Hosseini Moqadam were said to have been the
    complaints of 40 plaintiffs, identification of the defendant subsequent to
    publication of his picture in the media by the plaintiffs, and the
    defendant s confession during various phases of th
