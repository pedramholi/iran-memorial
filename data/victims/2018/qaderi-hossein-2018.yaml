    Authorities announced the cause of his death in the central prison of

    it. Information regarding Mr. Hossein Qaderi s death was obtained from
    Kordpa website (January 17, 2018), and No To Prison, No To Execution
    weblog (January 17, 2018). Additional information about this case was
    obtained from Iran Human Rights Monitor (February 4, 2018) and Gunaz TV
    (January 21, 2018). Mr. Qaderi was an ethnic Kurd, 30 years old, and
    resided in the city of Sanandaj. The information contained in this case is
    related to Mr. Qaderi s death at Sanandaj Prison. Nationwide Protests
    Popular public protests began on Thursday, December 28, 2018. On the first
    day, thousands of people in Mashhad, Kashmar, Birjand, and Neishabur in
    Khorassan Razavi Province participated in the No To Rising Prices
    demonstrations. In videos of these demonstrations disseminated online in
    social networks and in the media, the protestors also chanted slogans
    against several of the country s leaders. On the second day, protests
    spread to other cities in Iran including Esfahan, Shiraz, Tabriz, Rasht,
    Sari, Ghouchan, Sabzevar, and Khorramabad, and the protestors slogans
    turned against the institutions of the Islamic republic and the Leader of
    the Revolution himself. With the city of Qom joining other protesting
    cities, slogans were chanted in support of Reza Shah Phalavi. On the third
    day, simultaneous with government sponsored demonstrations celebrating Dey
    9th(December 30) in Tehran s Mosalla ( Prayer Place ), protests continued
    across Iran in Kermanshah, Dezful, Karaj s Gohardasht Neighborhood, Rasht,
    Arak, Shiraz, Shar-e Kord, Khorramabad, Zanjan, Bandar Abbas, Semnan, and
    Hashtgerd, with skirmishes breaking out between protestors and government
    forces. On December 31, 2018, protests continued in Tehran, Mashhad,
    Kermanshah, Rasht, Arak, Tabriz, Maragheh, Behshahr, Chahbahar, Hashtgerd,
    Orumieh, Dorud, amd Malayer. Iranian Television reported the death of 10
    people in the protests, and [the town of] Izeh s representative announced
    2 individuals had been killed in that town. Hamedan Governor s office also
    reported the death of 3 people. In a cabinet meeting, Iranian President
    Hassan Rohani addressed the protests for the first time and while
    reiterating the people s right to peaceful protests, stated that the
    government would not tolerate chaos and disorder. On the fifth day,
    January 1, 2018, the protests became more violent, with a police precinct
    in the town of Qahdarijan in Esfahan Province set ablaze, following which
    6 people were killed. Sanandaj was one of the cities involved in the
    public protests from the first days they began. Dozens of people were
    arrested during these protests, at least four of whom were killed in the
    city s detention centers. (1) Seven days after the protests began, the
    regime s supporters started demonstrations in various cities at the
    government s invitation, and condemned the popular protests. On that same
    day, even though smaller protests occurred in several cities, the protests
    generally began to subside. Social networking apps, Instagram and Telegram
    were filtered during the protests and the filtering of Telegram continued
    after they were over. From the time nationwide protests began, until its
    one year anniversary in December 2018-January 2019, Iranian government
    officials reacted differently to the events, ranging from ascribing it to
    internal political competition between various groups, to announcing a
    foreign enemy as the culprit. Protests against economic conditions
    continued and intensified through the end of 2018 with labor strikes in a
    number of factories, including Ahvaz Steel Factory and Neyshekar Haft
    Tappeh Factory (Haft Tappeh Sugar Cane Factory). Mr. Qaderi s Arrest and
