    was a kind, patient and jovial man. His former ward mates and friends
    describe him as a tolerant, experienced, worldly, and responsible person.
    News of the execution of Mr. Loqman Moradi, his cousin, Zanyar Moradi ,
    and another individual, was published by Fars News Agency (September 8,
    2018) and the official website of Tehran General and Revolutionary
    Prosecutor s Office (September 8, 2018). Additional information was
    obtained through research and documentation by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center, including official documents, as well as interviews with two
    persons with knowledge of the case, including a former ward mate
    (September 8, and 10, 2018) and other sources.* Mr. Loqman Moradi, son of
    Osman, was born in 1983 in the town of Marivan, a border town located in
    Kurdistan Province. He had been working since he was very young due to his
    family s financial condition and his father s illness, and was the family
    s breadwinner. He was a mountain porter for a long time and his last job
    was as crane operator 28 miles from the town of Marivan. (Boroumand Center
    interview with one of Mr. Moradi s ward mates, September 10, 2018). Mr.
    Moradi was a kind, patient and jovial man, and his ward mates thought of
    him as a member of their own family. He was very sensitive about social
    issues, and particularly followed Kurdistan-related news very closely. He
    was tolerant and had good relations with other prisoners regardless of
    their ethnicity and beliefs. His friends felt comfortable and secure
    around him. His friends considered him an experienced and worldly man. Mr.
    Moradi was also known for his sense of responsibility. He actively
    participated in all daily and common prison activities. (Boroumand Center
    interview with one of Mr. Moradi s ward mates, September 10, 2018). Mr.
    Moradi s case is related to the murder of three individuals in the town of
    Marivan in 2009. United Nations officials had repeatedly asked Iran to
    stop Mr. Moradi s execution. The last time they had transmitted a message
    to Iran was the day before his execution. (United Nations website,
    September 7, 2018). Other human rights organizations, including Amnesty
    International, had expressed concern about the execution of Mr. Moradi and
    his cousin, both before and after the death sentence was carried out.
    (Boroumand Center research). In a communique issued after its
    implementation, Amnesty International objected to Mr. Moradi s execution,
    citing violations of fair trial standards. (Amnesty International website,
    September 8, 2018). A brief overview of political clashes in the region
    The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with
    the objective of gaining autonomy for Kurdistan in northwestern Iran.
    After the 1979 Revolution, disagreements between the new central Shiite
    government and the mainly Sunni Kurdistan resulted in armed clashes
    between the Revolutionary Guards and the Peshmerga (PDKI militia),
    centering around issues such as the role of minorities in the drafting of
    the constitution, designation of Shiism as the official state religion,
    and, particularly, the question of Kurdistan s autonomy. Mass executions
    and fierce fighting continued for months in the region. In the four years
    that followed, PDKI lost much of its power in the region. A number of the
    Democratic Party of Kurdistan s leaders have been assassinated. Following
    internal conflicts, a schism occurred in the Party in 2006, and it was
    divided into two organizations, The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan
    and The Kurdistan Democratic Party . The Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan which had suspended its armed activities in the 2000 s until
    about 2014, started using its Peshmergas that year in order to conduct an
    armed struggle against the Isklamic Republic. (Kayhan London, October 23,
    2016). This and other armed Kurdish parties active in the region, accepted
    responsibility for more than ten armed operations inside Iranian territory
    between 2016 and 2018. (Boroumand Center research). Arrest and detention
    Mr. Moradi was arrested on August 2, 2009, by police officers and
    Information Ministry agents a few steps from his home and while he was on
    his way to work in the town of Marivan. (Boroumand Center Newsletter,
    Letter to the United Nations Special Rapporteur, January 30, 2012).
    According to Mr. Moradi, he was faced with an assassination charge 24
    hours after his arrest, and he had no idea what incident the charge was
    related to. After a few days, the officials explained to him the details
    of the charge, that is, the assassination of three individuals in Marivan.
    (HRANA, January 17, 2011). Mr. Moradi spent approximately 9 months in a
    solitary confinement cell in the city of Snanadaj Information
    Administration Detention Center and underwent physical and psychological
    torture. According to Mr. Moradi, he was interrogated and tortured by 6 to
    7 interrogators at all hours of day and night, in such a way that he could
    not sleep, eat, or rest. He only learned about
