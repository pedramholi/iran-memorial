    (August 25, 2018), Alef News and Analysis Society (September 2, 2018),

    1988-89, selling home appliances. A few years later, he owned several gold
    production plants and a refinery in the city of Noshahr, and had become
    one of the most influential businesspeople in the country. The case of Mr.
    Baqeri Darmani and 32 other individuals in the case involves establishing
    a gang, embezzlement, fraud, and bribery. The defendants hail from very
    different social backgrounds, among whom are four official experts of the
    Judiciary, two official notaries, and two Bank Melli Iran employees; five
    of the defendants are fugitives from the law, including Mr. Baqeri Darmani
    s brother. The adjudication of this case took four years. According to
    available information, Mr. Baqeri Darmani was first arrested on May 29,
    2007, by the Central Headquarters for Combatting the Trafficking of Goods
    and Foreign Currency, and was released on his own recognizance the day
    after the arrest. The Central Headquarters for Combatting the Trafficking
    of Goods and Foreign Currency announced that, according to existing
    evidence, Mr. Baqeri Darmani owed close to 20 thousand billion rials to
    the country s banking system. Two years later, upon complaints brought by
    the Central Bank, Melli Bank, Sepah Bank, and Keshavarzi Bank, Mr. Baqeri
    was charged with profiteering through illegal means, and on January 5,
    2009, he was sentenced by General Court Branch 1192 to 13 months in prison
    and return of assets. He was banned from entering any contracts and/or
    transactions on September 6, 2010. Arrest and detention Mr. Baqeri Darmani
    was last arrested on August 22, 2014, by Tehran Criminal Investigations
    officers, and spent the next four years at Evin Prison in Tehran. There is
    no information about the details of his arrest and detention. Trial Tehran
    Islamic Revolutionary Court, Branch 15, tried Mr. Baqeri Darmani in nine
    sessions before one presiding judge, two associate judges, and the
    defendant s attorneys. Four of the sessions were closed door. The public
    sessions convened on August 25, 2018 (Mizan, August 25, 2018), September
    2, 2018 (Alef News and Analysis Society, September 2, 2018), September 3,
    2018 (Mizan, September 3, 2018), September 4, 2018 (Mizan, September 4,
    2018), and September 15, 2018 (Mizan, September 15, 2018). (ISNA, December
    22, 2018). Charges Mr. Baqeri Darmani was charged with defrauding Jey Oil
    Company through the creation of a multi-member network where he was the

    Saman-e Majd Company; and payment of substantial amounts of bribes (Mizan
    website, November 15, 2018). According to available information, the case
    against Mr. Baqeri Darmani was initiated through a complaint lodged by Jey
    Oil Company at the Tehran Prosecutor s Office, District 11, on September
    3, 2012. They claimed that since early 2011, the six companies of Qaem
    Kowsar, Mo tamed Bazaegan Qaem, Toloo Eqtessad Mazand, Etemadgostar
    Soeheil, Hafezan Energy Shayan, Persian Namgostar, Shokooh Abideh, and
    Arya Borj, obtained 322 million 343 thousand and 336 kilograms of tar from
    Jey Oil Company by resorting to fraud and forged documents, and illegally
    obtained that company s assets. The Islamic Republic Police Force Special
    Operations Center s report also indicated that Mr. Baqeri Darmani was the
    leader of the networks which had engaged in fraud and illegally obtaining
    assets using the six companies (Mizan website, November 15, 2018). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
