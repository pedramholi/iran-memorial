    Information regarding the death of Mr. Faroq Hassan Khayat, son of
    Abdorrahim and Sherafat, was obtained from an interview conducted by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with Mr. Hiva Mirzaei, Mr. Khayat s
    friend (May 16, 2021). The news of this killing was also published on the
    official website of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Kurdistan
    Media (September 10, 2018), and on the Hengaw Human Rights Organization
    website (September 9, 2018). Additional information was obtained through
    interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with Mr. Kamal
    Karimi, member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (January 1, February 4,
    and March 2, 2021), Mr. Mansur Khosravi, member of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party (March 31, 2021), and Mr. Farzin Nadimi, research fellow
    at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (April 20, 2021).
    Additional information was obtained from the Kurdistan Democratic Party s
    Charter, passed in its 16thCongress (February 2016), Reuters News Agency
    (July 21, 2018), Persian Deutsche Welle (July 10, 1nd 22, 2018), the
    official website of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, Kurdistan u Kurd
    (February 16, 2016; September 7, 2016; September 8, 2018), ISNA News
    Agency (September 10, and 14, 2018), and other sources.* Mr. Hassan Khayat
    was an ethnic Kurd, Sunni Moslem, single, and born on March 21, 1986, in
    Bukan County s village of Bardeh Zard in Western Azarbaijan Province. He
    had an Associate Degree in Agriculture from Kurdistan University, and a
    Bachelor s Degree in Agriculture from Guilan University. In 2013, Mr.
    Hassan Khayat was admitted into the city of Hamedan s Bu Ali Sina
    (Avicenna) University to study Maters of archaeology, but could not attend
    due to his poor financial conditions. On May 28, 2014, he joined the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan as a Peshmerga. He was a Fourth
    Degree Staff member in the Party and taught a course on democracy and
    [another one] on the use of weapons at the Education Commission.
    (Boroumand Center interview, May 16, 2021). Mr. Hassan Khayat was a calm,
    dignified, well-mannered, frank and direct man. He insisted on strictly
    following the Party s principles, rules, and regulations. Mr. Hassan
    Khayat loved learning and liked reading history, Kurdish history in
    particular, and liked learning the English language. Mr. Hassan Khayat was
    in a relationship with a female Peshmerga member, and they were planning
    to get married. (Boroumand Center interview, May 16, 2021). The Kurdish
    Problem in the Islamic Republic After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the
    disagreements between the government of the Shiite Islamic Republic and
    the organizations in the Kurdish regions of western Iran regarding the
    rights and roles of minorities in drafting the Constitution; whether the
    government should be secular or religious, and especially the issue of
    Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in Kurdish political
    organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on instituting an
    Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed, clashes between the
    central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan Democratic Party s armed
    forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini labeled the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and most influential Kurdish
    Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it unofficial and illegal ,
    and ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass executions and intense
    armed clashes continued in the region for months, clashes that resulted in
    the deaths of a number of civilians and the displacement and relocation of
    the residents of certain towns. In the next four years, Kurdish parties
    lost their grip on power in the region to a great extent, and relocated to
    Iraqi Kurdistan. Since then, a number of their leaders and members have
    been assassinated outside Iran, especially in Iraqi Kurdistan. In the
    years since the Islamic Republic has been in existence, in addition to
    such entities as the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Komala
    (Revolutionary Organization of the Toilers of Iranian Kurdistan), the
    Koran School led by Ahmad Moftizadeh, Organization of Iranian Kurdistan
    Struggle (which was active in the early years of the Revolution), certain
    other Kurdish opposition parties were established outside Iran, such as
    the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) and the Kurdistan Freedom Party
    (PAK). These parties, with policies and ideologies that are not
    necessarily similar and uniform, have settled in parts of the Kurdistan
    Autonomous Region in Iraq, such as Koy, Soleimanieh, and in the foothills
    of Qandil mountains. Some of these parties have undergone splits in recent
    years. These conflicts have been more about the methods of running the
    organizations rather than theoretical and ideological differences. These
    parties have not controlled any part of the Iranian territory since the
    late 1980 s, and have adopted different strategies in different periods in
    order to confront the Islamic Republic, advance their political objecti
