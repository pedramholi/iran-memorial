    Mr. Akbarpur wished that the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan would be united again. Information regarding
    the killing of Mr. Mansur Akbarpur, son of Hashem and Nazdar, was obtained
    from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with Ms.
    Chenur Akbarpur, Mr. Akbarpur s sister (January 15, 2021). News of this
    killing was also published on the Akamnews website (September 9, 2018), on
    the official website of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, Kurdistan u Kurd
    (September 9, 2018), and on the Hengaw Human Rights Organization website
    (September 9, 2018). Additional information was obtained through
    interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with Mr. Kamal
    Karimi, member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (January 1, February 4,
    and March 2, 2021), Mr. Mansur Khosravi, member of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party (March 31, 2021), and Mr. Farzin Nadimi, research fellow
    at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (April 20, 2021).
    Additional information was obtained from the Kurdistan Democratic Party s
    Charter, passed in its 16thCongress (February 2016), Reuters News Agency
    (July 21, 2018), Persian Deutsche Welle (July 10, 1nd 22, 2018), the
    official website of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, Kurdistan u Kurd
    (February 16, 2016; September 7, 2016; September 8, 2018), ISNA News
    Agency (September 10, and 14, 2018), and other sources.* Mr. Akbarpur was
    an ethnic Kurd, 32 years old, from Mahabad County located in West
    Azarbaijan Province. He had a high school diploma with a concentration in
    experimental sciences. Mr. Akbarpur learned to be a dental technician as
    an apprentice working for his father, and obtained a two-year college
    degree equivalent in dentistry in Tabriz. He had a dental prosthetics
    laboratory and clinic in the city of Mahabad. Mr. Akbarpur had one son.
    (Boroumand Center interview, January 15, 2021). In his twenties, Mr.
    Akbarpur, influenced by friends who were older than him, developed a
    proclivity for political thoughts and activities. He developed these
    interests after one of his sisters joined the Kurdistan Democratic Party,
    and he had visited her several times at the Party and become familiar with
    the Party conditions. He carried out his political activities by lighting
    [ceremonial] fires in the mountains around Mahabad and installing the flag
    of Kurdistan, on the occasion of the Night of Yalda (the longest night of
    the year, celebrated by Iranian peoples since ancient times) and the
    anniversary of the establishment of the Kurdistan Democratic Party. The
    Mahabad County Information Administration warned him several times
    [against these activities] by phone. The pressure Mr. Akbarpur and his
    parents were under by Information Administration forces and the
    Revolutionary Guuards Information Sector increased after another one of
    his sisters joined the Kurdistan Democratic Party. His parents were forced
    to migrate to the town of Zakho in Iraqi Kurdistan because of the
    pressure. (Boroumand Center interview, January 15, 2021). In mid-May 2018,
    Mr. Akbarpur was summoned by phone to appear at the Mahabad Information
    Administration. He exited the country illegally from the Sardasht County
    border, however, and joined the Kurdistan Democratic Party as a Peshmerga.
    According to Mr. Akbarpur s sister, after he joined the Party, he told
    her: I wish I had come here sooner. It s as if I ve just been born and
    have started life over again. He went through the Party s training in five
    months, which usually takes a year to complete, and started to work as a
    guard at the Kurdistan Democratic Party Secretariat. He was interested in
    participating more seriously in the Party s struggles. (Boroumand Center
    interview, January 15, 2021). Mr. Akbarpur was a smart, assiduous,
    trustworthy, honest, serene, and genial individual. His dream was for the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party
    to be unified once again. (Boroumand Center interview, January 15, 2021).
    The Kurdish Problem in the Islamic Republic After the 1979 Islamic
    Revolution, the disagreements between the government of the Shiite Islamic
    Republic and the organizations in the Kurdish regions of western Iran
    regarding the rights and roles of minorities in drafting the Constitution;
    whether the government should be secular or religious, and especially the
    issue of Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in Kurdish
    political organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on
    instituting an Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed,
    clashes between the central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan
    Democratic Party s armed forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini
    labeled the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and
    most influential Kurdish Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it
    unofficial and illegal , and ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass
    executions and intense armed clashes continued in the region for mo
