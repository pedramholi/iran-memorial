    Information regarding the extrajudicial execution of Mr. Mohammad Raji was
    obtained from Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interviews with an individual
    close to the family (August 13, 2023, and February 20, 2024), the report
    of the Forensic Medical Office of Kahrizak county, Tehran province, after
    an autopsy of Mr. Raji s body (February 21, 2018), and a letter from the
    head of the Forensic Medicine Diagnostic and Laboratory Center of Tehran
    Province to the deputy prosecutor and head of the 27th district Prosecutor
    s Office of Tehran. (May 30, 2018) Additional information was obtained
    from interviews with four eyewitness, eyewitness one (August 18, 2023),
    Gonabadi darvish Abbas Dehghan who was arrested on February 20 in Golestan
    Haftom (August 19, 2023), eyewitness number two (February 17, 2024) and
    eyewitness number three (February 20, 2024); as well as from the websites
    of IRNA (February 25, 2018), Fars News Agency (March 5, 2018), a statement
    by Hojjat-ul-Islam Ali Sarlak, Mr. Raji's friend who had known him for two
    decades and had served with him during the Iran-Iraq War, on the Didban-e
    Iran website (March 7, 2018), Mizan (March 7, 2018), Majzouban Noor
    (September 13, 2018), IranWire (February 21, 2019), Dervishnameh magazine
    (February 22, 2019), and Radio Farda (March 4, 5, and 6, 2018). Mr.
    Mohammad Raji, son of Ali Asghar and Akram Hesami, was born on December
    22, 1961, in Aligudarz township, Lorestan province. At age 18, at the
    start of the Iran-Iraq war (September 1980), he volunteered to go to the
    front. A pro-government cleric who served under Mr. Raji during the war,
    stated that within a year, Mr. Raji's bravery and effectiveness as a
    "line-breaker" ( the volunteer unit that is the front of the attack that
    opens the way for the following troops) led to his rapid promotion. He
    quickly rose to command various battalions and operations, eventually
    attaining the rank of IRGC commander. Mr. Raji was injured many times
    during the war, but his most serious injury was caused by chemical
    weapons, which destroyed a large part of his lung, requiring him to use
    oxygen for a time (Hojjat-ol-Islam Ali Sarlak, Didbaneh Iran - March 7,
    2018). However, over the years, Mr. Raji regained his health and became an
    athlete. He was fond of wrestling and climbing and was very fit (Interview
    with a person close to the family - August 13, 2023). According to a
    person close to the family, Mr. Raji was very ethical and, therefore,
    after seeing the IRGC s "inhumane" behavior and corruption, he gradually
    became "disheartened" and requested to be discharged from the service, but
    his request was denied. He stopped going to work from 2001 until finally,
    in 2004, his early retirement was approved. (Interview, August 22, 2023)
    After retirement, he and his family returned to his place of birth, Maza
    ehabad village, in Aligudarz. They took up agriculture, so much so that he
    was named model farmer of the year (Hojjat ol-Islam Ali Sarlak, Dideban
    Iran, March 7, 2018). Mr. Mohammad Raji, who had a "God-seeking" spirit
    and was looking for "transcendence," became acquainted with Nematollahi
    Gonabadi Darvishes and practices around 2010, and joined them after some
    research and participation in their meetings. After Mr. Raji became a
    darvish, various people from the representative of the Supreme Leader to
    the top commanders of the IRGC went to see him to convince him to leave
    the Gonabadis, blaming them for his parting ways with the IRGC. However,
    Raji s retirement and actively distancing himself from the IRGC took place
    six years before he joined the Darvish Order. (Interview with a person
    close to the family - August 13, 2023). In this regard, Hojjat-ol-Islam
    Sarlak also acknowledged Mr. Raji s "spiritual tendencies," and the
    changes he underwent from 2003 onwards. He said in a speech we talked to
    him many times, but unfortunately, Mr. Raji had chosen his path. (Hojjat
    ol-Islam Ali Sarlak, Dideban Iran - March 7, 2018) Ne matollahi Gonabadi
    Darvishes and the history of their suppression in the Islamic Republic (1)
    Dervishian or Sufism is a spiritual aspect of Islam that emphasizes each
    person's inner relationship with, and love for, God. There are different
    opinions about the origin of Sufism. Some consider it an Aryan reaction
    against Islam, some consider it to be derived from Brahmanism and Buddhism
    in India, some relate it to the wisdom of the Greeks, and others identify
    Christianity and Manichaeism as the origin of Sufism. In addition to all
    these beliefs, some people consider Sufism to have originated as a school
    of Islam and the teachings of the Qur an. The Nematollahi lineage is one
    of the old Sufi sects. The word Nematollahi is taken from the name of the
    great eighth-century Iranian mystic, "Seyed Nureddin Shah Ne matollah
    Wali," and after him, this path and its followers became known as "Ne
    matollahi. Currently, the Nematollahi lineage of SoltanAliShahi Gonabadi
    (known as Gonabadi Darvishes) is one of Iran's most populous Sufi lin
