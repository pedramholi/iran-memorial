    requesting a new trial, and Mr. Salas children s letter to the Leader of
    the Islamic Republic of Iran. (Documents available at the Boroumand
    Center). Mr. Salas was born in 1967 in the city of Borujerd in Lorestan
    Province, and resided in Tehran. He had two children and was a bus driver.
    After becoming acquainted with Sufism (2) , he became a follower of the
    Nematollahi Soltan Alishahi Gonabadi order (known as Gonabadi Dervishes
    (3) ), one of the most famous Sufi orders. Mr. Salas case is related to
    the killing of three police officers in February 2018 in Tehran On
    February 19, 2018, at 6:20 PM, following a protest gathering by a number
    of Gonabadi Dervishes on Seventh Golestan Street at Tehran s Pasdaran
    neighborhood, a white bus drove toward police and Basij forces that had
    taken up position on said street, hitting the forces and resulting in the
    death of three officers and injury to eight others. (Tehran Province
    Judiciary, June 19, 2018, Mizan News Agency, March 11, 2018, Tehran
    Province Criminal Court Branch 9 s Decision). Upon becoming acquainted
    with Sufism, Mr. Salas became a follower of the Nematollahi Soltan
    Alishahi Gonabadi order (known as Gonabadi Dervishes), one of the most
    famous Sufi orders. A Brief Summary of the Events at Seventh Golestan
    Street Following news of the arrest of Nurali Tabandeh, the leader of the
    Nematollahi Order, the Gonabadi Dervishes gathered in front of his house
    on February 3, 2018, to prevent an attack on his home located on Pasdaran
    s Seventh Golestan Street. The gathering led to a skirmish with security
    forces and plainclothes agents that same night, two days later, with the
    increase in the number of Dervishes in attendance, more skirmishes broke
    out. Two days later, Nurali Tabandeh issued a message asking his followers
    to maintain their calm and leave the location. Following the arrest of one
    of the Dervishes on February 19, 2018, however, protests and gatherings
    started on Seventh Golestan Street once again, but this time, facing more
    severe confrontation from security and plainclothes forces. News sources
    estimated the number of Dervishes arrested during these protests at 300.
    Arrest and detention According the then-Police Force spokesman, Mr. Salas
    and 8 other Dervishes present at Pasdaran s Seventh Golestan Street were
    arrested on February 19, 2018. (BBC Persian, February 20, 2018). No
    information is available regarding the time of arrest and the arresting
    authority, and the materials published in official state media conflicts
    with unofficial news sources and the statements of Mr. Salas attorney. It
    was stated that Mr. Salas was the driver of the bus that had run over
    three police officers that same night. (Tasnim News Agency, April 24,
    2018). In a video broadcast after the incident by state media in Iran, Mr.
    Salas can be seen with severely wounded and bloodied head and face lying
    on a hospital bed, describing the events. Mr. Salas was transferred to the
    Shapur Criminal Investigations Bureau detention from the hospital, and
    underwent interrogations there. He was deprived of access to an attorney
    and of contact with his family during interrogations. (Amnesty
    International Report, July 17, 2018) After the completion of the
    preliminary investigations phase, Mr. Salas was transferred to Rajaishahr
    (Gohardasht) Prison in the city of Karaj, where he was detained for four
    months until the implementation of his sentence. No information is
    available regarding the number of times and the manner in which he visited
    with his family and attorney. His last visitation with his family occurred
    on June 17, 2018, at Rajaishahr Prison. (Majzooban-e Noor Website, June
    17, 2018, BBC Persian, June 18, 2018). It was stated that Mr. Salas was
