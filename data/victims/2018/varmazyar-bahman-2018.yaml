    Was a hair stylist and a trainer at a sports club in Hamedan, and had no
    criminal record News of the execution of Mr. Bahman Varmazyar, child of
    Abbas, was published in Mizan News Agency s website and by ISNA (Iranian
    Students News Agency), quoting Hamedan Province Capital s General and
    Revolutionary Prosecutor (April 18, 2018), and in Aftab News and Hamshahry
    newspaper s websites (April 18, 2018). Additional information about this
    case was obtained from the following websites: HRANA s (Human Rights
    Activists news Agency) (April 16, 2018, and May 12, 2018), Iran Human
    Right Organization (April 16, 2018), ISNA and IRNA s (Islamic Republic
    News Agency) (April 17, 2018), Rokna, Hamshahri newspaper, and Hamedan
    Province State Radio and Television News Agency (April 18, 2018). Mr.
    Varmazyar was a single man from the city of Hamedan, born on February 18,
    1991. He was a hair stylist and a trainer at a sports club in Hamedan. His
    case, and the case of three other individuals, is related to an armed
    robbery from a jewelry store in Hamedan s Hessar neighborhood on April 30,
    2015. Arrest and detention Eighteen days after the armed robbery, Mr.
    Varmazyar turned himself in to Hamedan s Criminal Investigations Bureau on
    May 18, 2015, and returned the stolen goods. (HRANA, May 12, 2018). On the
    day of the robbery, one of the robbers was caught by the people and turned
    over to the police. However, Mr. Varmazyar fled the scene with the stolen
    property. The other two defendants were arrested a few days later. Mr.
    Varmazyar spent two years and eleven months at Hamedan s Alvand Prison. He
    had regular visitations and his mother and other relatives visited him
    every Monday. On Friday, April 13, 2018, Mr. Varmazyar and one of his
    co-defendants in the case were transferred to solitary confinement cells
    at Alvand Prison. According to his brother, Bahman and his co-defendant
    were transferred to solitary confinement on Friday and were shackled and
    handcuffed . (HRANA, April 16, 2018). His last visitation with his family
    took place on Monday, April 16, 2018. Mr. Varmazyar s family contacted
    numerous individuals and governmental organs in order to save their loved
    one s life. Trial Hamedan Islamic Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Varmazyar
    and the other defendants in the case. He was represented by counsel. There
    is no information, however, regarding the trial session(s). Charges The
    charges brought against Mr. Varmazyar were said to have been Moharebeh (
    waging war with God ) through armed robbery, creating fear and
    apprehension in the city and at the scene of the crime . According to
    available information, Mr. Varmazyar and three other individuals robbed a
    jewelry store. One of the individuals was armed and fired several shots
    into the air in the course of the robbery. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Varmazyar was stated to be the confessions of the defendants, the theft of
    1.639 kilograms of gold, and the store owner s complaint . Nine months
    after the robbery, however, the store owner went to the prosecutor s
    office and withdrew his complaint. (Hamshahri newspaper, April 18, 2018).
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense Mr. Varmazyar had no criminal record and this was
    the first time he had taken such actions. He was not armed during the
    robbery. Expressing regret and remorse, he turned himself as well as the
    stolen property over to the authorities. Furthermore, he did not have a
    private plaintiff. In response to the prosecutor who had considered Mr.
    Varmazyar s actions as creating fear and apprehension in the public, his
    mother had gathered 300 signatures from the business owners and residents
    of the neighborhood and none wanted his execution. (HRANA, May 12, 2018).
    Mr. Varmazyar and the other defendants objected to the sentence. There is
    no information regarding the defense he and his attorney presented. A
