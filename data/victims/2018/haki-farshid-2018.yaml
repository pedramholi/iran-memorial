    The last written words of Mr. Farshid Haki was the following: "People have
    nothing to lose but their chains." Information about the extrajudicial
    execution of Mr. Farshid Haki, son of Mojtaba and Marzieh, married with
    one daughter, was obtained in an ABC interview with Mr. Behrang Ahmad
    Ejtehadi, maternal uncle of Mr. Haki (Jan. 26, 2024), ABC interview with
    Mr. Mohammad Moqimi, one of the legal representatives appointed by the
    family (June 12, 2023). The news of the extrajudicial execution of Mr.
    Haki was also published by ISNA News Agency (Oct. 24, 2018), Rokna News
    Agency (Nov. 21, 2018), and the BBC Persian Service (Oct. 23, 2018 ). For
    the complementary material we have used interviews with people who closely
    worked with Mr. Haki; these were posted on the websites of Radio Zamaneh
    (Oct. 26, 2018, Oct. 23, 2018, and Oct. 17, 2019), Deutsche Welle (Oct.22,
    2018), and on the weblog of Arman-e Shahrvandi (Nov. 22, 2018); we also
    used the information posted on Mr. Haki's page on LinkedIn (Oct. 8, 2016).
    Mr. Farshid Haki was born on Dec. 16, 1974 in the town of Arak. He loved
    writing from an early age. After completing his high school studies and
    the compulsory military service he continued with his studies at the
    University of Mazandaran (North of Iran) and obtained a dual B.A. in
    economics and human rights; he eventually graduated with a PhD in
    economics. He was a lecturer at the university of Payam-e Nur , and a
    practising lawyer. He also advised businesses and economic periodicals as
    an external consultant. Mr. Haki's uncle described him as a person who
    "loved reading and writing. He enjoyed a good financial and social
    status."(ABC interview with Mr. Ahmad Ejtehadi, Jan. 26, 2024) Mr. Haki
    was a socialist and considered the labor force and human rights activities
    particularly important. He was an honorary member in the Union of Mechanic
    Smelters and had founded a few NGOs whose mission was to protect children
    who were forced to labour and homeless women. Societal problems affected
    him deeply. He described himself as the "buddy of child labourers".
    Prostitution and homelessness upset him profoundly (ABC interview with Mr.
    Ahmad Ejtehadi, Jan. 26, 2024). Mr. Haki put himself forward as a
    candidate for Tehran City Council: the first time in 2013 and the second
    time in 2017, upon the request of the working force, but failed to get
    sufficient votes. His campaign slogan was "a coalition for the invisible"
    by which he intimated the work force and the destitute. His societal
    misgivings, his concern about the working class and human rights abuses,
    his expertise in economics and his love of writing led him to author a
    number of books including "Economic and Societal Rights of individuals in
    Iran", "The Concise Citizenship Utopia for the People of Iran", and "A
    Human Rights Dialogue for All". He was also an environmental activist.
    Together with a group of experts they conducted research on damages caused
    to nature by dumping nuclear waste, and issues related to water shortage.
    The researches provoked the ire of the authorities leading to the arrest
    of a number of the researchers and a ban on working for some others. Mr.
    Haki believed that it was possible to do some effective work even within
    the framework of the laws of the Islamic Republic. He attempted to
    register his own political party named "The Party of the Vanguards of
    Justice and Rights For the People of Iran" but confronted the opposition
    of the authorities (ABC interview with Mr. Ahmad Ejtehadi, , Jan. 26,
    2024) In a message posted on LinkedIn on October 8, 2016, Mr. Haki
    announced that starting from 2009 until then [i.e. 2016] he had applied
    nine times to the interior ministry to register his party, each time his
    application had been declined. He explained that his party's priorities
    were to achieve justice, rights and socio-economic progress (issues such
    as attainment of justice, diminishing societal damages suffered by victims
    of child labour, addiction, marginalized women, homeless people...through
    the application of rational political and scientific-based economic
    strategies and a dialogue of understanding). He declared that he had
    applied for a licence for the 10th time. The application never saw the
    day. (Mr. Haki's LinkedIn page, Oct. 8, 2016) Mr. Haki was an active
    public speaker in political and social circles, where he harshly
    criticised the dire conditions prevailing life in Iran; stood up for
    political prisoners, such as Mr. Abdolfatah Soltani, a lawyer who had been
    jailed, and Ramin Hossein Panahi, a Kurdish political prisoner who was
    executed later; he condemned the killing of piggy backers; and defended
    political prisoners and prisoners of conscience incarcerated in Gohardasht
    Prison. He published articles on his own Telegram channel named "The
    Vanguards of Justice". One of the founding members of the "Vanguards" said
    that in one of the many attempts made by Haki to register the party of
    "Vanguards of Justice" he had been warned by an offi
