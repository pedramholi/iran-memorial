    The information about Mr. Mas'ud Ansari is based on an interview with his
    sister. He was born in Khorramabad in 1957 and had two children. He was a
    student in Tehran Polytechnic University and a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization. He was arrested once in Khorramabad in August of 1980.
    He was condemned to six months imprisonment for being a member of the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Majority, but he was released after four months. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the
    Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was
    founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 Revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority considered the Islamic Republic
    as a revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime and supported it. After the
    spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely
    because of their political beliefs. Arrest and detention Mr. Mas'ud Ansari
    was arrested in Tehran while going to a house for a meeting on October 20,
    1984. The house was surrounded by Revolutionary Guards. They beat him
    severely before arresting him. According to the interviewee, he told the
    family later about the circumstances of his arrest. He was held at the
    Joint Committee, Khorramabad prison, and Evin prison. Five months after
    his arrest, he had a visit from his mother. During this visit, the marks
    of torture and signs of solitary confinement were evident on his body.
    According to his sister, he was tortured severely at the Joint Committee
    and at Khorramabad prison in such a way that he lost his psychological
    balance and his memory, and suffered from severe headaches. During a visit
    with his wife after returning from Khorramabad, he did not recognize her
    and spoke gibberish. According to one of his cellmates, he was given
    tranquilizers and slept most of the time. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. According to his sister quoting a
    cellmate, one day Mr. Ansari returned from interrogation and told his
    cellmate that he hit his interrogator. Shortly after, his name was called
    and he was executed. Charges No information is available on Mas'ud
    Ansari's charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available about his defense. Mr. Mas'ud Ansari
    was denied the right to have an attorney. Judgment No specific information
    is available about the defendant's execution sentence. According to his
    sister quoting a cellmate, Mr. Mas'ud Ansari was executed by firing squad
    at Evin prison on May 4, 1987. When his mother went to visit him at Evin,
    the officials told her that he was buried in Khavaran cemetery. She went
    to Khavaran and searched the fresh soil with her hands until she could
    recognize her son's pants and finally saw his face. A few days later, she
    put a metal plaque on the soil with her son's name engraved on it. After
    some time, the regime's agents destroyed all the graves with a bulldozer.
    Today, Mr. Ansari's mother has no idea about the location of her son's
    remains.
