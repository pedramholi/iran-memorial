    He had great ability in the art of organization, the art of communicating
    with the masses, the art of self-control, patience, and endurance, the art
    of continuing the struggle, lifting morale, strengthening the
    organization, and continuing the path taken by those who lost their lives
    fighting for the party. Information about the life and extrajudicial
    execution of Mr. Hamidreza Chitgar, son of Khanum Bozorg and Ramezan Ali,
    is taken from the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s (ABC) interview with one
    of Mr. Chitgar's relatives and his wife (May 11, 2006), an electronic form
    sent to ABC by one of his relatives (September 24, 2006), a statement by
    Mr. Chitgar's wife and his friends (no date - two months after the
    incident), the German language newspaper TAZ (July 20, 1987), the
    Iran-Netherlands Committee for the Defense of Political Refugees (July 21,
    1987), Profil news magazine (July 27, 1987), Kayhan Havai (July 29, 1987),
    Ms. Chitgar, the wife of Mr. Chitgar s citation (June 26, 1987), Kurier
    (July 11, 2014), Iran Labor Party (Toufan) (July 21, 1987, March 8, 2017,
    May 31, 2020), Rah-e Toufan magazine - the organization of supporters of
    Iran's Labor Party abroad (July/August 1987), letter-writing campaign by
    MPs Petrovic, Anschoberand friends to the Federal Minister of Justice
    (June 5, 1997), the Committee for the Defense of Iran-Netherlands
    Political Refugees (July 21, 1987), his daughter's speech (May 19, 2017)
    and two writings by Mr. Chitgar's brother-in-law, entitled Hamidreza
    Chitgar, from arrest to assassination (May 18 and May 31, 2020).Based on
    the available information, Mr. Chitgar, born in 1949 in Babol (Mazandaran
    province), was married and had a daughter. He was an electronic engineer,
    and before the 1979 revolution, he worked in the Esfahan s Steel Company.
    During his time in the military, he worked in a private company. More than
    a year before the revolution, he went to Strasbourg with a scholarship
    from the French government to study for his master's degree. Mr. Chitgar
    returned to Iran a month before the revolution and actively organized
    strikes and demonstrations against the Pahlavi dynasty. At the "General
    Sanati" factory, he was one of the factory's labor council activists. His
    [political] party friends say: "Hamid's revolutionary characteristics
    prevented him from sitting quietly when the evil reactionary forces rose
    to crush the demands of the people." (Iranian Labor Party (Toufan)- March
    8, 2017) After the 1979 revolution, he opened a well-equipped printing
    house near Khayam Park in Tehran and started publishing. His printing
    house printed books, non-political publications, and his own party s
    publications. After he returned to France in early 1982, he completed a
    pre-doctoral course in electronics at the University of Strasbourg. He
    became a doctoral student at the Louis Pasteur University in Strasbourg.
    He also worked at the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). The
    head of the project said about Mr. Chitgar: "He was witty, hard-working
    and incredibly talented." (Profil news magazine) Mr. Chitgar turned to
    political activity during the Shah's reign and joined the Toufan
    organization, later called Iran's Labor Party, under the pseudonym Hamid
    Bahmani in 1976. Mr. Chitgar was arrested on March 3, 1982, during a
    sudden search of his printing house by Revolutionary Guards in Tehran and
    was detained in Evin prison. On that day, the guards found a cylinder of a
    machine that had printed their party's magazine and had yet to be cleaned.
    Hamid denies any connection with the party and claims that they bring
    their work to the printing house as customers. (Mr. Chitgar's
    brother-in-law) At that time, Mr. Chitgar was among the leaders of the
    Labor Party (Toufan). According to Mr. Chitgar's relatives, he was
    tortured, but he remained adamant and insisted that the individuals who
    referred to him were clients of the printing house. (Abdorrahman ABCs
    Interview with Mr. Chitgar's wife - November 9, 2023) During those few
    days, in the mornings, when guards would take him from Evin prison to the
    printing house to set a trap for political activists by pretending that
    the printing house was open, he found an opportunity to escape. He was in
    prison for less than a month. (Statement by Mr. Chitgar's wife and
    friends) Mr. Chitgar left the country on January 10, 1983, with the party
    leadership's decision, through the mountains of Iran and Turkey; he
    arrived in Paris on February 11, 1983, and sought asylum. He started his
    political activity in exile as the head of the foreign office of the "Iran
    Labor" party. Because of this position, he was in contact with the party s
    supporters in Iran. He was also a member of the party's central committee
    and participated as a party representative in the National Council of
    Resistance*. His organizational friends from the Toufan Party write: "He
    had great ability in the art of organization, the art of communicating
    with the masses, the art of self-control, patience, a
