circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Hossein Karamipur, son of Musa and born and residing
    in Ilam, was reported in the Kayhan daily on August 18, 1987. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial,
    other than he was tried at the Division One of the Penal Court of
    Bakhtaran (Kermanshah). Charges According to this report, Mr. Karamipur
    was charged with “sodomy and first-degree murder.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the report, Mr. Karamipur had confessed to having committed
    the crimes. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Karamipur’s defense. Judgment The Penal
    Court of Bakhtaran (Kermanshah) condemned Mr. Karamipur to death and the
    Supreme Judicial Council approved the sentence. Mr. Hossein Karamipur was
    hanged in public on August 13, 1987 at Takhti Stadium in Ilam. He was 21
    years old.
