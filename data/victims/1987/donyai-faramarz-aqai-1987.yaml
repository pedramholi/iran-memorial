    Mr. Aqa'i Donya'i was a nurse from the city of Esfahan, and was a member
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. Information regarding the killing of
    Mr. Faramarz Aqai' Donya'i was published in the official website of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (undated; July 3, 2018) and Asoo (February 1,
    2019). Additional information about this assassination was obtained from
    Raha News Agency website (March 23, 2021); the International Peace Studies
    Center (December 6, 2018); Islamic Revolution Documents Center (July 7,
    2007); United Press International News Agency (July 9, 1987); and the
    Washington Post (July 23, 1987). Mr. Aqai Donya'i was a 22 year old nurse
    from Esfahan. He was a member of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    (Official website of the Mojahedeen Khalq Organizatio, undated). The
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization
    adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its
    members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary and they believed in
    armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a
    progressive method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam
    as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the
    MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In
    1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam
    as its ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other
    Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its
    ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the
    MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO
    were released along with other political prisoners. They began to
    re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic ideology.
    After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
    the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. * Mr. Aqa'i Donya'i s Death Mr. Faramarz Aqai' Donya'i was killed
    on Wednesday, July 8, 1987, in Karachi, Pakistan, in an armed attack by
    members and supporters of Pakistan s Tahreek Jafaria Party on the
    Mojahedeen Khalq Organization (MKO) bases. (Islamic Revolution Documents
    Center, July 7, 2007; official website of the Mojahedeen Khalq
    Organization, July 3, 2018; Asoo, February 1, 2019). According to a
    Washington Post report, on July 6, 1987, approximately one hundred
    thousand supporters of Pakistan s Tahreek Jafaria Party assembled in the
    city of Lahore, Pakistan, and openly supported Khomeini and Iran s Islamic
    Revolution. The Party s spokespersons warned that they would not tolerate
    any opposition to Khomeini and the Iranian regime whatsoever. Two days
    later, 13 MKO bases in the cities of Karachi and Kuweiteh were
    simultaneously subjected to armed attacks, resulting in the death of two
    people and the wounding of 30 Party members. (The Washington Post, July
    23, 1987). Pakistan s Tahreek Jafaria Pakistan s Tahreek Jafaria was a
    Shiite political organization that was founded in 1984, and led by Arif
    Hussain Al-Hussaini after a split in the Tahreek Nefaz-e Fiqh-e Jafaria (
    The Party for the Implementation of Jafari (Shiite) Islamic Law ). The
    Tahreek-e Nefaz-e Fiqh-e Jafaria was founded in March 1979, inspired by
    Iran s Islamic Revolution. After the Party leader s death in 1984, the
    movement was split into two groups. The religious faction was led by Seyed
    Hamid Ali Shah Mussavi. The political faction led by Arif Hussain
    Al-Hussaini, supported by Ayatollah Khomeini, founded the Pakistan s
    Tahreek Jafaria. Arif Hussain Al-Hussaini, who had studied in [the city
    of] Qom [in Iran, one of the two major centers for Shiite seminary
    studies, the other being the city of Najaf in Iraq], and had studied under
    Ayatollah Khomeini in Najaf, was shot and killed by unidentified
    individuals at Peshawar s Dar-ol Ma arif Islamiah seminary on August 5,
    1988. When Pervez Musharraf banned the group s activities in 2002, the
    Party changed its name to Threek-e Eslami ( Islamic Party ). Iranian
    Officials Reaction There is no information available regarding the Iranian
    government s reaction. Pakistani Officials Reaction The Karachi Police
    arrested 40 individuals with Iranian, Iraqi, and Pakistani nationality in
    connection with the attacks. The Police also recovered and confiscated
    five automatic rifles made in the Soviet Union, 31 rocket launchers, five
    Uzi weapons made in Israel, ammunition, and other flammable materials .
