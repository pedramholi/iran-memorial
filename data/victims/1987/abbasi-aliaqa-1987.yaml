    The execution of Mr. Aliaqa Abbasi was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on
    December 24, 1987. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to the report, Mr.
    Abbasi was charged with “first-degree murder.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Abbasi’s defense. Judgment Branch 135 of Penal Court
    sentenced Mr. Abbasi to death. Having been confirmed by Branch 16 of the
    Supreme Court and the Head of the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence
    was carried out in prison at dawn. According to the report, Mr. Abbasi
    “was taken from the solitary confinement to the prison guard’s room at
    4:30 a.m. At first… the religious rituals were performed. Then after
    saying his morning prayers and writing his will, the convict was taken to
    the gallows. He was executed in the presence of the director of the
    Prison, Assistant Prosecutor and forensic doctor. His body was removed
    from the gallowed and carried to the Department of Forensic Medicine after
    12 minutes.”
