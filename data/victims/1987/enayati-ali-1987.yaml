    The execution of Mr. Ali Enayati was reported in the Kayhan daily on
    December 24, 1987. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to the report, Mr.
    Enayati was charged with the “murder of five children.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There
    is no evidence present in the report that specifically incriminates Mr.
    Enayati. According to the newspaper, all the defendants were both
    implicated through their confessions during the preliminary stages of
    their interrogations, and also through the presence of witnesses during
    their trial. There is no mention of the specifics of these confessions.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Enayati's defense. Judgment The
    court of the Shahrebani sentenced Mr. Enayati to death, and the sentence
    was confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Court. He received 74 lashes in
    prison and was executed.
