    The information about Mr. Hamid Zamani Kandovani is drawn from an
    interview with his wife. He was born on November 28, 1960 in Tehran. He
    started his political activism before the revolution when he was a
    teenager. He was a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization and had
    actively remained in contact with them. After the split of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization in 1979, he joined the Minority faction. Mr. Zamani
    Kandovani was affable and had a good sense of humor. He had a hopeful and
    positive attitude. He had a good voice and sang Turkish songs beautifully.
    His family was from Ardabil and his native tongue was Azeri. He was active
    and energetic, and had a black belt in karate martial arts. The Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization, a Marxist-Leninist group inspired by the Cuban
    Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded
    in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following
    the 1979 revolution, the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, which had renounced
    armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of
    the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic
    Republic, and was active mainly in the political arena and the labor
    movement. Arrest and detention Mr. Zamani Kandovani was arrested on May
    17, 1985 and taken to Tohid prison. During the previous regime, this
    prison was known as the Joint Anti-Sabotage Committee, which was later
    renamed Ward 3000 and then Tohid prison. Before and after the revolution,
    political prisoners were tortured in this infamous prison, which today is
    the Ebrat Museum. However, the Ebrat Museum is dedicated to the acts that
    took place before the revolution and only a pre-selected list of prisoners
    have been selected to be commemorated. Mr. Zamadi Kandovani’s family was
    not informed of his arrest. He was held incommunicado for one year. His
    family tried their best to find out some information about him – visiting
    hospitals and even forensic offices to see if he had died – but they were
    unable to obtain information about him. About six months after his arrest,
    his wife found out that he was alive through word from other prisoners.
    Eleven months after his arrest, his family members were allowed to send
    him clothes and money. One month later, Mr. Zamani Kandovani was
    transferred to Evin prison and was allowed to have visitors. His family
    members noted that he had lost a lot of weight and appeared frail.
    According to his cellmates, he had been tortured and his feet were badly
    wounded and swollen. Trial The first trial for Mrs. Zamani Kandovani was
    held one and half years after his arrest, and condemned Mr. Zamani
    Kandovani to death. However, and appeal court held another hearing because
    of his family’s persistence and appeals to higher judicial officials. Both
    trials were held in Tehran. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Zamani
    Kandovani is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of the execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Zamani Kandovani’s
    defense. He was denied the right to have an attorney or access to his
    file. Judgment According to his wife, the second trial approved Mr. Zamani
    Kandovani’s death sentence due to the fact that he refused to recant his
    political beliefs and publicly condemn the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization in
    a filmed interview. Mr. Hamid Zamani Kandovani was executed on, or soon
    after, May 3, 1987. On this date, he made a phone call to his wife, who
    describes the conversation as follows: “Hamid said: ‘I called to say happy
    birthday to Ronak – our daughter.’ I said: ‘What is going on? Her birthday
    is a few days away and I will visit you tomorrow.’ Then it occurred to me
    what the matter was. I asked: ‘What are you trying to say? If you can’t
    say it yourself, why don’t you give the phone to another prisoner?’ He
    said: ‘I don’t have much time. Let me talk with you during the remaining
    time.’ His last words were: ‘I’m sure Ronak will grow up to become a fine
    and amazing person with your care.’ He wrote the same thing in his will.
    He also told me: ‘All the love you feel for me – give it to Ronak. I’m
    going with your memories and your gift.’ He meant the hand-crafted gift
    that I had made with rocks for him in prison.” Mr. Zamani Kandovani’s wife
    added, “The next day, on May 4, six people and I went to visit our loved
    ones in prison. The authorities told us to stay to the side and then they
    said that we could not visit that day. I started to yell and scream, ‘Did
    you kill him? Do you have no mercy?’ There was another woman crying as
    well. The guard told us to go and return in three days. Other women
    dragged me away. Three days later, we were informed of the execution.” Mr.
    Zamani Kandovani has been buried at the Behesht Zahra Cemetery. His wife
    went to the cemetery as soon as she heard about his execution. She said,
    “The first time I went there, I saw a woman whose child had died in a car
    accident and
