    The execution of Mr. Reza Saruqi was reported in the Kayhan daily on
    December 12, 1987. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to the report, Mr.
    Saruqi was charged with first-degree murder. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Saruqi's defense. Judgment Mashad’s Penal Court sentenced
    Mr. Saruqi to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial
    Council, the sentence was carried out at dawn.
