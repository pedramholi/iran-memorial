    Ms. Parvin Goli Abkenari is one of the 1,533 executed prisoners listed by
    the Association of Iranian Women of Köln (Germany). The list, published on
    September 10, 1997, is entitled: "A Partial List of Women Executed by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran.” This list has been updated by former political
    prisoners living throughout the world. The information about Ms. Parvin
    Goli Abkenari is taken from the book Our Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism
    by Rah-e Kargar Publications. She was born in Abkenar near Bandar Anzali.
    She was a clerk at Melli Bank and a sympathizer of the Revolutionary
    Workers Organization of Iran, Rah-e Kargar. Her husband (Mehran
    Shahaboddin) and her brother (Ruzbeh Goli Abkenari), who were both the
    sympathizers of this organization, were also executed. "Rah-e Kargar" or
    the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the
    summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various
    leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in
    political action. They identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists,
    promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat.
    They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they
    opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest

    suicide after suffering severe torture. In part of her last letter to her

    patient heart…. I try to fill my boring days with the memories of my short
    and good life. I wish you a better and brighter future."
