    News of Mr. Sorush (also spelled "Surush") Jabbari s execution was
    published in the Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran (June 13, 2019).
    Mr. Jabbari s name is also mentioned in the List of Baha i Martyrs and
    Prominent Persons (January 11, 2017). Mr. Jabbari was one of the 206
    individuals whose name was published in the Worldwide Baha i Community s
    1999 report. This report, entitled The Baha i Question: Iran s Secret
    Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community , dealt with the
    persecution of members of the Baha i faith in Iran by the Islamic
    Republic, and contained a list of Baha is who were killed in Iran since
    1979. Mr. Jabbari was born into a Baha i family on September 11, 1942, in
    the town of Sissan in Eastern Azarbaijan Province. He and his family moved
    to the town of Miyaneh after a few years. He completed part of his high
    school education there until the age of 16 and then moved to Tehran to
    continue his education. After obtaining his high school diploma, he
    started working for a construction company as a draftsman, and gradually
    became the head of the drafting department. Mr. Jabbari was fired in 1982
    for being an adherent of the Baha i faith. Upon closure of the Baha is
    administrative offices in Iran in 1982-83, Mr. Jabbari was appointed as
    member of a board charged with handling the affairs of the Baha i
    community. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    Baha i religious community is the largest minority group in Iran, with
    approximately 300,000 members in 1979 (more current figures are not
    available).* The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected Baha
    is religious to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of
    their most fundamental human rights. The Baha i religion is not recognized
    under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities
    refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha is have been denied the
    rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot
    profess and practice their faith and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence. ** Arrest and detention On September 15, 1984, Mr. Jabbari
    was arrested along with five other Baha i Community Board members. No one
    knew where he was being detained for two and a half months. After a while,
    his family found out that Mr. Jabbari was at Karaj s Gohardasht Prison.
    Mr. Jabbari was ultimately transferred to Evin Prison. He was in prison
    for two years and six months. Trial No information is available Mr.
    Jabbari s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Jabbari is not
    known. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Jabbari. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Jabbari s defense. Judgment On March 3,
    1987, Mr. Sorush Jabbari was hanged at Tehran s Evin Prison. Mr. Jabbari s
    body was not turned over to his family and the family believes he was
    probably buried by government agents. -----------------------------------
    * Slow Death for Iran s Baha is by Richard N. Ostling, Time Magazine,20
    February 1984. Also see The Persecution of the Baha is of Iran, 1844-1984,
    by Douglas Martin, Baha i Studies,volume 12/13, 1984, p. 3. There is no
    information about the current number of Baha is in Iran. ** The Islamic
    Republic Penal Code grants no rights to Baha is, and the courts have
    denied them the right to redress or to protection against assault, murder,
    and other forms of persecution and abuse. In so doing, the courts have
    treated Baha is as unprotected citizens or apostates, citing eminent
    religious authorities whose edicts are considered a source of law equal to
    acts of Parliament. The Founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah
    Khomeini, made execution a punishment for the crime of apostasy and
    decreed that a Muslim would not be punished for killing an apostate.
    Banishment from public functions has seriously damaged the Baha is
    professional, economic, and social lives. Soon after the revolution, a
    Ministry of Labor directive called for the dismissal from public office
    and all governmental organizations and associations of those who belong to
    any of the misguided sects recognized by all Muslims as heretical
    deviations from Islam, or to organizations whose doctrine and constitution
    are based on rejection of the divinely-revealed religions. Finally, the
    mandatory requirement of specifying religion in application forms and
    official documents (lifted recently in some areas under international
    pressure) has seriously limited Baha is freedoms and opportunities in all
    areas of their lives including divorce, inheritance, access to
    universities and travel. In practice, since 1980, thousands of Baha is
    have lost their jobs, pensions, businesses, properties and educational
    opportunities. By banning the Baha i administration including Spiritual
    Assemblies - the elected bodies that lead and administer the affairs of
    Baha
