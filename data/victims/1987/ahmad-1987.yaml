    The execution of Mr. Ahmad, son of Mohammad Morad, along with two other
    men, was reported in the Kayhan newspaper on October 26, 1987. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the trial. Charges
    According to this report, Mr. Ahmad was charged with “the repulsive act of
    sodomy and murder of a boy.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Ahmad’s defense. Judgment According to Kayhan , the “First Penal Court of
    Hamedan issued the death sentence after 25 months, and the Supreme Court
    approved the verdict… Three methods of execution were proposed for the
    murderers: beheading by sword, collapsing a wall on their heads, and
    throwing them off a cliff. The murderers chose the third option.” Mr.
    Ahmad and two other men, “in the presence of some officials,” were thrown
    off Mount Darband near Asadabad in Hamedan province.
