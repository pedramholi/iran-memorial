    Information about Mr. Alireza Akbari Shandiz, son of Hossein, is based on
    several electronic forms sent to Omid by persons familiar with this case.
    His name is also on the list ofthe Fadaiyan Khalq Organization s victims.
    Additional information is taken from the facebook page of Rooz Online (May
    21, 2017). According to this information, he was born in Mashhad in 1952.
    He was the oldest child in his family, a high school graduate, and a
    sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization Majority. According to an
    electronic form, Mr. Akbari Shandiz had been imprisoned for political
    activism for five years during the previous regime. After being released
    in 1977, he joined the Fadaiyan Khalq Guerilla Organization and took
    charge of the Kurdistan branch of the organization. He later became a
    Politburo member of the Fadaiyan Khalq Majority organization. The house he
    was grown up in was a hide-out for Seyed Ali Khamenei in several occasions
    (Rooz Online Facebook page). The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization - a
    Marxist-Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America - was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the
    organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority
    considered the Islamic Republic to be a revolutionary and anti-imperialist
    regime and supported it. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic
    Republic targeted its members solely because of their political beliefs.
    Arrest and detention According to one electronic form sent to Omid, Mr.
    Alireza Akbari Shandiz was arrested, probably in Tabriz, in June of 1981.
    He was detained for five years without trial or an attorney. According to
    another electronic form, Mr. Akbari Shandiz was arrested by the
    Revolutionary Guards in Orumieh when planning to cross the border in May
    of 1981. He was first transferred to Tabriz and then to Evin Prison in
    Tehran. According to this report, he had had no visitation by early 1982.
    While in detention and after Khamenei was elected as President, his famiy
    sought assistance from Khamenei to no avail (Rooz Online Facebook page).
    Trial According to one electronic form sent to Omid, Mr. Akbari Shandiz
    was not tried. However, according to another electronic from, he was
    probably tried at Evin Prison in January of 1987. Charges No information
    is available on Mr. Akbari Shandiz s charges. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Akbari Shandiz. Defense No information is
    available about Mr. Akbari-Shandiz s defense. Judgment No specific
    information is available about Mr. Akbari Shandiz s execution. According
    to the information sent to Omid, Mr. Alireza Akbari-Shandiz was executed
    in Tehran on March 8, 1987. A grave location in Behesht-e Zahra cemetery
    was shown to his family as his burial place two months later. According to
    the list of victims of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization Majority, he was
    executed by firing squad in March of 1988.
