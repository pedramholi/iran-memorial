    News and information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Nureddin
    (Nader) Tavakoli Nabavi, son of Mitra and Mohammad Ali, and his father was
    published in Kayhan Published in London newspaper (October 8, 1987), the
    Times newspaper (October 4, 1987), and the Washington Post (November 1,
    1987). According to available information, Mr. Nureddin Tavakoli Nabavi
    was 24 years old and single. After the 1979 Revolution, his father sent
    him to England along with the rest of the family, and remained in Iran
    himself. After his father came to London, Mr. Tavakoli Nabavi would go
    with him to Hyde Park every week, and translate his father s speeches
    against the Islamic Republic into English for the listeners present at the
    Park. He would also distribute leaflets against the Islamic Republic among
    the attendees. (Kayhan Published in London newspaper). After arriving in
    London, Mr. Tavakoli Nabavi s father continued his political activities
    against the Islamic Republic of Iran, and founded the Nationalist Youth
    Association along with other supporters of the constitutional monarchy,
    and published a newspaper called Nationalist Youth. This group also
    organized and conducted a number of meetings in London. When Ms. Moneer
    Tavakoli, Mr. Tavakoli Nabavi s mother, had gone to the Iranian Consulate
    in London to renew her passport, the officials there threatened her and
    conditioned the renewal of her passport upon preventing her husband and
    son from going to Hyde Park [for their gatherings every week]. (Kayhan
    Published in London newspaper). Mr. Tavakoli Nabavi s father intended to
    organize a large demonstration on the occasion of November 2 (the birthday
    of Reza Pahlavi, Iran s Crown Prince), and had even prepared leaflets and
    announcements for that purpose. Background of Extrajudicial Killings by
    the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long
    history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world.
    Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside
    the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since
    then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has
    so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases there has not been much published and
    the local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
    evidence, and traces obtained through investigations conducted by local
    police and judicial authorities confirm, however, the theory of state
    committed crimes. In certain cases, these investigations have resulted in
    the expulsion or arrest of Iranian diplomats. In limited cases outside
    Iran, the perpetrators of these murders have been arrested and put on
    trial and the evidence presented, revealed the defendants connection to
    Iran s government institutions, and an arrest warrant has been issued for
    Iran s Minister of Information. The manner in which these killings were
    organized and implemented in Iran and abroad, is indicative of a single
    pattern which, according to Roland Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor,
    contains common parameters and detailed planning. It can be ascertained
    from the similarities between these murders in different countries that
    the Iranian government is the principal entity who ordered the
    implementation of these crimes. Iranian authorities have not officially
    accepted responsibility for these murders and have even attributed their
    commission to internal strife in opposition groups. Nevertheless, since
    the very inception of the Islamic Republic regime, the Islamic Republic
    officials have justified these crimes from an ideological and legal
    standpoint. In the spring of 1979, Sadeq Khalkhali, the first Chief Shari
    a Judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts, officially announced the
    regime s decision to implement extrajudicial executions, and justified the
    decision: These people have been sentenced to death; from the Iranian
    people s perspective, if someone wants to assassinate these individuals
    abroad, in any country, no government has any right to bring the
    perpetrator to trial as a terrorist, because such a person is the
    implementing agent of the sentence issued by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court. Therefore, they are Mahduroddam and their sentence is death
    regardless of where they are. More than 10 years after these
    proclamations, in a speech about the security forces succ
