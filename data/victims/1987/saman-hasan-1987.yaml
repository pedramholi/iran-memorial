    The execution of Mr. Hasan Saman, born in Damghan and residing in Tehran,
    along with another defendant, was reported in the Kayhan daily on December
    8, 1987. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges According to the report, Mr. Saman was charged
    with “highway robbery, murder, kidnapping and robbery.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Saman's defense. Judgment Karaj’s Penal Court sentenced
    Mr. Saman to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council,
    the sentence was carried out in public at 3 p.m.
