    Information about the execution of Mr. Ardeshir (also spelled "Ardishir")
    Akhtari was obtained from documents published in the Archives of Baha i
    Persecution in Iran including a detailed biography titled Ardeshir Akhtari
    - Executed in Tehran on 28th September 1987 and Mr. Akhtari s will
    Ardeshir Akhtari s last will before execution (September 1987). Additional
    information was acquired from London Kayhan Newspaper Two Baha is executed
    in Tehran (October 15, 1987), Gooya Newsletter The Third National
    Spiritual Assembly: The Assembly that was disbanded and then executed, for
    the anniversary of the shutdown of the last nationally elected institution
    of the Baha i community of Iran, Mehrdad Bashiri (September 13, 2019), and
    the Spokesman Review Newspaper (October 3, 1987). Lastly, information
    about the Mr. Akhtari s arrest and burial were obtained from an article on
    Radio Farda (August 31, 2021). Mr. Ardeshir Akhtari is one of the 206
    Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report documents the persecution of the
    members of the Baha i faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists
    those killed since 1978. Additional information has been drawn from
    various issues of The Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986,
    Haifa 1994. Mr. Ardeshir Akhtari was born in Tabriz in 1937 (ABPI) but his
    family moved to Tehran when he was six months old (Gooya Newsetter). At
    15, he left school due to his father passing away, and began working at
    the National Insurance Company of Iran (ABPI, Gooya Newsletter). He was a
    member of the National Board of Directory when, in 1981, he was fired from
    the company due to his adherence to the Baha i faith (ABPI). Mr. Akhtari
    was first elected to serve in the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tehran, then
    in 1981 he was chosen to serve in the Third National Spiritual Assembly of
    Iran, where he served until 1984 (ABPI). He and Amir Hossein Naderi were
    among the last members of the Third National Spiritual Assembly to be
    arrested and served the longest sentences out of all the members. Mr.
    Akhtari was a person full of life, eager for progress, and had high morals
    (Gooya Newsletter). In his will, he regretted not being able to raise his
    children and to leave the burden on his spouse alone (ABPI, Ardeshir
    Akhtari s will 1987). The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the
    members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious
    minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the
    time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified
    and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Baha i National Spiritual Assembly After the
    Islamic Revolution In the organizational structure of the Baha i
    community, the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly is a body
    composed of nine individuals that are elected annually with the votes of
    adult Baha is in each country. This institution tends to the affairs and
    issues of the Baha i community on the national level. The National
    Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of guiding, coordinating, and
    moving forward the activities of each country s local spiritual
    assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl ( House of Justice
    ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the highest
    decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I s
    Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual assemblie
