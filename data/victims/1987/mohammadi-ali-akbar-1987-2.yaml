    Information regarding the life and the extrajudicial execution of Mr. Ali
    Akbar Mohammadi, son of Assieh and Hassan, was obtained through interviews
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with his brother (December
    22, 2020), one of his close friends (March 13, 2021), and another one of
    his friends (April 12, 2021). Additional information about this case was
    obtained from Mr. Mohammadi s statement after fleeing Iran (Boroumand
    Center documents); Sharq News website (March 9, 2021); Iran Wire (August
    27, 2020); Asr-e Iran website (August 13, 2009); Radio Farda (February 23,
    2004); Focus German magazine (February 9, and 21, 2004); Jomhurie Eslami
    newspaper (August 14, and 15, 1986); Kayhan Havai (August 20, 1986,
    January 28, 1987, and August 6, 2020); a portion of Mr. Mohammadi s
    interview with the Aparat website after his escape from Iran; Taz German
    newspaper (January 29, 1987); the Washington Post (July 8, 1987); the
    Associated Press (January 16, 1987); German Interior Minister s response
    to questions posed by a Member of Parliament and the Green Party (December
    21, 1987); Shahrvand newspaper (August 14, 2014); the book There is Still
    a Judge in Berlin by Messrs. Mehran Payandeh, Abbas Khodagholi, and Hamid
    Nozari (1998-99); and the book Terror in The Name of God by Mr. Parviz
    Dastmalchi (2020). Mr. Mohammadi was married and had a daughter. He was
    born in Tehran on July 30, 1947 and was the eldest child of a well-to-do
    family. He obtained his high school diploma from Mohammad Naraghi High
    School in Tehran s Niavaran district, and obtained a bachelor s degree in
    English from the Tehran College of Translation. Mr. Mohammadi obtained his
    advanced pilot s license in Manila, the Philippines. He was a renowned
    footballer (soccer player). His interest in football had started in high
    school. He played for the Iran National Youth Team and then played for
    such well-known clubs as Oghab and Persepolis. This boy was respected and
    loved by everyone in the entire family. He was extremely kind and was a
    friend to everybody. Everybody truly loved him. (Boroumand Center
    Interview with Mr. Mohammadi s brother, December 22, 2020). After
    finishing his pilot s training, Mr. Mohammadi started working for the
    Prime Minister s Office s Air Taxi Company. He was an instructor as well
    as a pilot of Falcon 20 jets that were at the disposal of the Prime
    Minister s Office, the princes, and guests of the Royal Court, and was
    used on international trips. (Boroumand Center Interview with one of Mr.
    Mohammadi s close friends, March 13, 2021). After the Revolution, Mr.
    Mohammadi decided not to work in the Iranian airline industry. He engaged
    in business in the Philippines for a time. After a while (less than a
    year), however, he was invited to return to his previous job [of piloting
    Falcon jets] which were used after the Revolution by cabinet ministers and
    guests of the Islamic Republic, under the supervision of the Mostaz afan
    Foundation. (Boroumand Center Interview with one of Mr. Mohammadi s
    friends, April 12, 2021). Mr. Mohammadi was the pilot designated for
    cabinet ministers and certain other Islamic Republic government officials,
    as well as a flight instructor. He also took these airplanes abroad, for
    instance to France, for annual inspections. (Boroumand Center Interview
    with one of Mr. Mohammadi s close friends, March 13, 2021). According to
    one of his friends, Mr. Mohammadi was not a very religious man, but he
    believed in God. That is, he wasn t a Hezbollahi (die-hard supporters of
    the Islamic Republic) or someone who would engage in shady deals with them
    in the system He prayed, but did not like praying in his place of work at
    all, or growing a beard, or doing things of that nature. He was in the
    company of Iranian officials during their trips because of his work, and
    was not happy about working in post-Revolution conditions. He believed
    that the media (print and television) misled the people. The officials
    only think about their personal interests and do not think about Iran and
    the Iranians. They mislead and dupe people and take the country backward
    and into an abyss. He believed that one of the country s biggest problems
    was the war. They want to stay in power no matter what it takes, and they
    continue the war and use it as a means to silence the discontented people.
    (Boroumand Center Interview with one of Mr. Mohammadi s close friends,
    March 13, 2021). Escape from Iran At eight o clock in the morning of
    August 13, 1986, Mr. Mohammadi took off from [the city of] Rasht Airport
    in a Falcon training jet, accompanied by his brother and his
    brother-in-law (his wife s brother), and left Iran. He flew to Iraq using
    Turkish airspace. Several Iraqi jets initially forced him to land in Mosul
    Airport; he subsequently flew to Baghdad with a number of Iraqi military
    personnel in tow. A group of Iraqi officials, as well as reporters, were
    waiting for him at Baghdad Airport. According to one of his friends, Mr.
    Mohammadi had done his re
