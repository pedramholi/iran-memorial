    The execution of Mr. Ali Reza Amiri was reported in the Kayhan daily on
    May 17, 1987. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s

    Penal Court, Division One. Charges Mr. Amiri was charged with first-degree
    murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Amiri’s
    defense. Judgment Branch 131 of Tehran’s Penal Court sentenced Mr. Amiri
    to death and the Supreme Court approved the sentence. Mr. Ali Reza Amiri
    was hanged at dawn of May 17, 1987 in the presence of the head of the
    prison, representatives of Tehran’s Prosecutor, forensic doctor and the
    judge at Qasr Prison in Tehran.
