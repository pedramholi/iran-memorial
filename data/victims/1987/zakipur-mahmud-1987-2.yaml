    The information about Mr. Mahmud Zakipur has been drawn from an interview
    with another victim’s wife, as well as from the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization’s website. Mr. Zakipur was born in Abadan (in the Province of
    Khuzestan) in 1946. He was married and had a daughter. He started his
    political activism in the 1970’s when he was a student at Tehran
    University. He was arrested in 1972 and imprisoned. He was released along
    with other political prisoners in 1978. He was affiliated with the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization and joined the Majority branch when the
    organization split. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist
    group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements
    of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to
    the Pahlavi regime. After the 1979 Revolution, the organization, which
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority supported and
    considered the Islamic Republic a revolutionary and anti-imperialist
    regime. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic Republic targeted
    its members solely because of their political beliefs. Arrest and
