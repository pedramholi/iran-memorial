    The information about Mr. Mahmud Mahmudi was taken from the book Prison
    Dialogues , a Monograph for Mahmud Mahmudi (2003)". He was born in Lahijan
    and had two children. He graduated from Tehran University majoring in
    Accounting. He was a member of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization (Minority).
    During the previous regime, he was arrested along with the Jangal Group
    (Siahkal) and was first condemned to death. But later, his sentence was
    commuted to ten years imprisonment. He was released in November, 1978. A
    year later, he was expelled from the Fadaiyan Organization due to his
    opposition of the Organization s closeness with the leadership of the
    Islamic Republic. After a division in the Organization, he joined a
    minority group called the minority. The Fadayian Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadayian Khalq
    Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was mainly active in the
    political arena and the labor movement. In 1982, Mr. Mahmudi was exiled to
    Kurdistan for six months because of his opposition to the Central
    Committee. Sometime later, he was again expelled because of his opposition
    to the leadership of Fadaiyan Khalq Minority. During that period he began
    publishing a periodical called Kar-e Vijeh (special work). In 1984, the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization broke off with him. In April, 1985, he tried
    to leave the country by going to Bandar Abbas. But, he wasn't successful
    and had to return to Tehran. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are unknown. According to the book
    Prison Dialogues , there was no arrest warrant for Mr. Mahmud Mahmudi
    (known as Babak). He was driving near Shahreray on April 27, 1985, when he
    was arrested and was taken to Joint Commitee. According to Siavash
    Mahmudi, who was also arrested along with Mr. Mahmud Mahmudi, some men on
    motorcycles approached them, pointing their guns at them saying: "Are you
    smuggling?" The same source mentions: "Mr. Mahmud Mahmudi's torture began
    during the first minutes after his arrest. In prison, they interrogated
    him day and night. It was rare for him to be left alone for even a few
    hours. His legs were blackened from constant torture. According to the
    same source, after his death sentence was issued, the judge said: You can
    visit your wife for few minutes. They took them in a room near the court
    room with opened door and a Guard standing two meters away. A few minutes
    later, they separated with the notion that it was their last visit, but it
    wasn t. Several times, they took him out of his cell telling him he would
    be executed, but tortured him and kept him alive. During his 22 months
    detention, Mr. Mahmud Mahmudi was denied the right to have an attorney. He
    had only three visits with his wife and several telephone conversations
    with his family. Trial No information is available on the defendant s
    trial. According to the book Prison Dialogues , Mr. Mahmud Mahmudi's trial
    was in Evin prison in 1986. In the first session, he asked for an open
    court and to have an attorney; but, his request was denied. His trial took
    several days. After the ruling was issued, his case was not sent to an
    appeal court. Charges According to the book Prison Dialogues , Mr. Mahmud
    Mahmudi was able to give his cellmates the text of the Public Prosecution
    Office charges against him. These charges are as follow: "He refused to
    answer questions correctly and declared that he believes in a
