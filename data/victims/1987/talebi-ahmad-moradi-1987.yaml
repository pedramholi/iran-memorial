    Information regarding the extrajudicial execution of Major Moradi Talebi
    was sent to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center electronically and via email,
    by one of his relatives (March 19, 2006). News of this extra judicial
    execution was also published in the following websites: Fars News Agency
    (March 12, 2016), Mehr News Agency (October 25, 2021), WarIsBoring: in two
    parts (August 29 and September 5, 2017), Skyhunter (December 5, 2012),
    Sharq News (March 9, 2021), and in an interview with pilot Brigadier
    General Shahram Rostami (October 19, 2017). A small section of Mr. Moradi
    Talebi s interview was published on YouTube. Mr. Moradi Talebi was married
    and he had three children (one of his children was born after his death).
    He had studied in the United States and he was a major in the Iranian Air
    Force. Mr. Moradi Talebi s wife was also an officer in the Air Force; it
    is said that she retired after the revolution. One of Mr. Moradi Talebi s
    co-workers said, Ahmad Moradi was one of our old friends and he was a good
    pilot. (Mehr News Agency) According to information we have received, Mr.
    Moradi Talebi was in line with the Islamic revolution when it happened.
    After two years he decided that this revolution would not bring about
    democracy, and he became opposed to the Islamic Republic. He wanted to
    leave the armed forces, but regulations would not permit him to do this.
    Therefore, he decided to escape in order to go and live in America (Email
    from Mr. Moradi Talebi s relative). According to a former Air Force
    commander, when interviewed about Mr. Moradi, he said that he did not come
    to work on time during the days of the revolution and the marches;
    according to him, he had been participating in the marches, and this was
    an unacceptable and intolerable thing to do in the military. (Interview
    with Shahram Rostami, former Air Force commander) According to one of his
    coworkers, one time when Mr. Moradi Talebi and his wife were going to
    Varamin, they were stopped at a Committee Guards checkpoint. They were
    asked to open their suitcase and when they refused, he was beaten and
    assaulted by several agents of the Committee (Mehr News Agency). After
    this incident, in the spring of 1986, he asked for vacation time and went
    to Germany with his family. His family stayed in Germany and he returned
    to Iran. According to available information, at 2 pm on September 2, 1986,
    Mr. Moradi Talebi and his copilot Hasan Najafi received orders to provide
    security for oil tankers carrying crude oil from Khark Island with an F14.
    He continued to patrol the skies after the first refueling, but after the
    airplane gained altitude he proceeded to fly towards Iraq. According to
    Tom Cooper s interview with Ahmad Seddiq, an officer in the Iraqi Air
    Force Intelligence Service, after many years of war with Iran, Iraqi
    forces decided on a new tactic in dealing with the Islamic Republic Air
    Force. The Iranian F14s were very powerful opponents in the sky, and they
    had incurred much damage with the Phoenix Missiles carried by these jets.
    The Iraqis decided to contact the pilots of the Iranian Air Forces and
    convince them to flee Iran. Starting in 1984, the Iraqis established
    telephone contact with Iranian pilots. In this regard, Ahmad Seddiq says:
    We talked to Iranian pilots in English from Istanbul, Turkiye. We were
    able to find several pilots. Some of them expressed a desire to escape
    from Iran but they wanted to go to the West, not to Iraq. (WarIsBoring,
    August 29, 2017). The Iraqis continued their efforts and eventually
    contacted Mr. Moradi Talebi, F14 pilot based in Esfahan Air Force Base. He
    was in contact with the Iraqi Armed Forces Intelligence Agency for quite
    some time without alerting the Iranian counterintelligence agents. Mr.
    Moradi was scheduled to flee Iran on September 3, 1986. However, he was
    assigned and proceeded to fly a military air patrol to protect Iranian oil
    tankers near Bushihr, one day earlier. He therefore used this opportunity
    to carry out his plan. When their jet fighter entered Iraqi air space,
    they were attacked by the Iraqi Air Force, who know nothing about this
    escape plan. They fired and hit the jet fighter. The two pilots were able
    to eject and land safely with parachutes. (Al Alam Network) That same
    afternoon, news was broadcast about an Islamic Republic Air Force F14
    having been fired on and crashed near Nowmaniyeh in Iraq. That evening,
    the pilot (Mr. Moradi Talebi) and copilot/radar operator (Hasan Najafi) of
    this plane appeared on Iraqi National TV. The co-pilot was against
    defecting and seeking asylum. He stayed in Iraq as a prisoner of war and
    returned to Iran in September 1990. Mr. Moradi Talebi s coworkers believe
    he escaped to Iraq because of the assault and battery he was subjected to
    by the agents of the Committee and because of the lack of adequate welfare
    amenities. In an interview in Iraq, Mr. Moradi Talebi said: Khomeini, is
    interested in prolonging the war for his own survival and for more control
    over
