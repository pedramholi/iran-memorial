    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Hatefi Majomard was reported in the
    Kayhan newspaper on November 5, 1987. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial, other than he
    was tried at Branch 6 of the Public Penal Court of Yazd. Charges According
    to the report, Mr. Hatefi Majomard was charged with “kidnapping, rape and
    armed robbery.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hatefi
    Majomard’s defense. Judgment Branch Six of the Penal Court of Yazd
    sentenced Mr. Hatefi Majomard to death. The Supreme Judicial Counc
    approved the verdict. He was executed at the prison of the Police
    Department in the presence of some of the plaintiffs on November 3, 1987.
