    Mr. Mansuri was a major and a fighter pilot in the Pahlavi Era Air Force.
    He defected to Saudi Arabia with an F4 fighter jet. News of the
    assassination of Mr. Mohammad Hassan Mansuri was published in Cumhuriyet
    Turkish Newspaper (August 1, 1987; February 12, 1989; and March 16, 1990),
    and Milliyet Turkish Newspaper (May 8, 2000). Additional information was
    gathered from Asoo website (February 1, 2019), Rozaneh (October 15, 2020),
    Balatarin (no date), and from an article published by Brigham Young
    University in the United States (2013). Major Mansuri, Pahlavi Era fighter
    pilot, was living in the United States (Balatarin). On March 4, 1982, Mr.
    Mansuri took off from Bushehr Sixth Hunting Base with an F4 fighter jet on
    a training mission. Mid-flight, he changed course, left Iran, and flew to
    Saudi Arabia. He then requested asylum and emigrated to America. Mr.
    Mansuri objected to the government of Iran s persistence in continuing the
    Iran-Iraq was after the recapture of Khorramshahr (Balatarin). After
    leaving Iran, Mr. Mansuri contacted the Mojahedin Khalq Organization of
    Iran, and encouraged his former cohorts to leave Iran and to object to
    Ayatollah Khomeini s decision to continue the Iran-Iraq war. This resulted
    in another fighter pilot defecting to Iraq with his F4 jet (Balatarin).
    Background of the Iran-Iraq War and popular discontent The 8-year long
    Iran-Iraq war had roots in a number of historical territorial and
    political disputes including over the Shaṭṭ al-ʿArab , a river that was
    the border between the two countries, dating back to the 1930s. The two
    countries had attempted to settle the border dispute through a treaty in
    1937, from which Iran withdrew in 1967, and an agreement in 1975, which
    Iraq reneged on in 1980 shortly before its September 1980 offensive
    against Iran. Two months into the war, and after capturing the city of
    Khorramshahr, Iraq s army had bogged down into Iran s territory. By
    mid-1982, Iran had recaptured most of its territory and carried out
    offensives inside Iraq. In July 1982, The UN Security Council approved a
    resolution calling for an immediate cease fire between Iran and Iraq. The
    withdrawal of forces to their own borders, but Iran rejected the
    resolution. Iranian leaders stressed in various statements that the
    withdrawal did not satisfy Iran's conditions for an end to the war. [NYT,
    6/30 and 7/14] For Iran s decision makers, the fall of Saddam and
    compensation were the preconditions for peace. (Washington Post, February
    21, 1983; FBIS April 24, 1985) The stalemate in the war inflicted a heavy
    cost, in particular on civilians as Iraqi and Iranian planes bombed
    population centers and targeted the oil industrial complexes in both
    countries, Iraq used chemical weapons against the Iranian army and its own
    Kurdish population and Iran sacrificed thousands, mainly young boys, on
    minefields in Iran. (NYT, March 14, 1985) By 1986, the high human cost of
    the war, the shelling of the cities, and the displacement of the most at
    risk populations had weakened significantly popular support for the war.
    Critical statements and protests in April and May 1985 as well as
    defections, including of pilots, were reported by the media. (FBIS April
    25, 1985; Washington Post, May 18, 1985)* Mr. Mohammad Hassan Mansuri s
    Death Mr. Mohammad Hassan Mansuri was killed on July 25, 1987, in Levent
    district of Istanbul, Turkey (Milliyet Turkish Newspaper, May 8, 2000;
    Asoo, February 1, 2019; Rozaneh, October 15, 2020). According to available
    information, Mr. Mansuri had gone to Istanbul to coordinate and facilitate
    the emigration of the family of another Iranian fighter pilot. He and an
    Iraqi diplomat were meeting with the family in a house in the Levent
    Neighborhood, when they were assassinated by two people with guns equipped
    with silencers (Asoo, February 1, 2019; Rozaneh, October 15, 2020).
    According to Milliyet Newspaper, members of Iranian backed Islamic groups
    in Turkey orchestrated the murder of Mr. Mansuri. Suspects who were
    arrested in connection with the assassination of several Turkish and
    Iranian citizens, and who were members of Islamic Groups in Turkey,
    confessed that these groups received guerilla training in Iran and that
    the Iranian government provided them with money and training . (Milliyet
    Turkish Newspaper, May 8, 2000) Examination of the bullets showed that Mr.
    Mansuri and Mr. Hadi Aziz Moradi were assassinated with the same gun
    (Asoo, February 1, 2019, Rozaneh, October 15, 2020; Balatarin). Officials
