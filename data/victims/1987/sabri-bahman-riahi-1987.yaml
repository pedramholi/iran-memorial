    was severely tortured while he was in custody. According to one of his
    relatives, some joints of his finger were cut off and there were severe
    burn marks on his back. Information about the execution of Mr. Bahman
    Riahi (Sabri), son of Khadijeh and Habib ollah, was obtained through an
    electronic form sent by a relative of Mr. Riahi on January 19, 2018, as
    well as Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interview with one of his relatives
    on January 31, 2018. Additional information in this regard is taken from
    the book "Siavoshan, Remembrance of the Victims of the Ranjbaran Party of
    Iran" by Bagher Mortazavi. Mr. Bahman Riahi was born in 1942-43 in a
    village near the city of Shahr-e Kord in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari
    province. His mother s family was from the Qashqai tribe and his father s
    side were Lors. Due to his family's respect for his maternal grandfather,
    his mother's last name, Riahi, was chosen for him instead of his father's
    last name (Sabri). Close relatives of Mr. Riahi describe him as a
    friendly, calm, and polite man who always smiled (ABC interview and the
    Siavoshan book). In the early 1960s, Mr. Riahi was a student at the
    University of Tehran medical school. He was expelled from university due
    to his political activities during that time and he fled Iran
    subsequently. After some time, he obtained a master s degree in physics in
    Italy. During that time he joined the International Confederation of
    Iranian Students (National Union)*, and the Revolutionary Organization**
    of the Tudeh Party of Iran*** (Siavoshan book). Mr. Riahi returned to Iran
    shortly after the 1979 revolution and continued his political activities
    in Iran through membership in the Ranjbaran Party (ABC interview and the
    electronic form). According to available information, Mr. Riahi played a
    major role in forming the Ranjbaran Armed Group in Qashqai district in
    Fars province. Mr. Riahi lived underground for two years following 1981
    (Siavoshan book). According to a relative of Mr. Riahi, he got married
    after returning Iran. However, at the time he was living underground, his
    wife demanded a divorce and got separated (ABC interview). Arrest and
    detention In 1983-84, Mr. Riahi was identified and arrested by
    Revolutionary Guard officers in Esfahan. There is no information available
    on the details of his arrest and detention. According to available
    information, between 1983 and 1987 Mr. Riahi was detained in several
    different cities, including Shahr-e Kord Prison, Dastgerd Prison in
    Isfahan, and Adel Abad Prison in Shiraz. Mr. Riahi was able to meet with
    his family during this period (Boroumand Interview and the Siavoshan
    Book). According to one of his relatives, Mr. Riahi was tortured while he
    was in custody (Boroumand Interview). Trial According to available
    information, Mr. Riahi did not have access to an attorney in his court
    session(s) (Boroumand Interview). No additional information is available
    on Mr. Riahi s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Riahi was
    association with Ranjbaran Party (Boroumand Interview). There is no
    information available on details of this charge. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Riahi. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Riahi s defense. Despite the fact that the execution order for Mr.
    Riahi was issued, the authorities informed his family that he was supposed
    to be released from prison. Judgment There is no information on the
    verdict leading to the execution of Mr. Riahi. According to available
    information, despite the fact that the execution order for Mr. Riahi was
    issued, the authorities informed his family that he was supposed to be
    released from prison. When Mr. Riahi's sister and brother travelled from
    Shahr-e Kord to Adel Abad prison in Shiraz in order to pick up Mr. Riahi,
    they were informed that Mr. Riahi's death sentence had been issued and
    that it would be their last visit. A few days after the last visit, on
    January 26, 1987, Mr. Bahman Riahi was hanged in Adel Abad prison in
    Shiraz. Mr. Riahi's body was handed over to his family one day after the
    execution and was buried in his family s hometown. According to one of Mr.
    Riahi's relatives, while washing the body for the burial, signs of torture
    on Mr. Riahi's body were clearly visible: some joints of his finger were
    cut off and there were severe burn marks on his back. Mr. Riahi's family
    was not allowed to hold the ceremony in the mosque (Boroumand Interview).
