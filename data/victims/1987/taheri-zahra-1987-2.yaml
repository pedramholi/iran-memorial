    Sometime after Ms. Taheri was abducted at the Pakistan border, her family
    received letters from her, telling them she had arrived at Camp Ashraf in
    Iraq. Her brother, who was at this camp at the time, had no news of Ms.
    Taheri. Information on the disappearance and killing of Ms. Zahra Taheri
    has been collected from Mojahedin e Khalq Organization Website (December
    26, 2016) and Begoo Na News Agency (August 10, 2019). This news was also
    published in Simaye Azadi Television Website (August 5, 2017), Asoo
    Website (February 1, 2019), and Eshterak Website (August 17, 2019).
    Additional information was gleaned from Mojahedin e Khalq Organization
    Website (November 15, 2016). Ms. Zahra Taheri was a supporter of Mojahedin
    e Khalq Organization. She was 29, and she was born in Tehran. (Mojahedin e
    Khalq Organization Website, November 16, 2021) The Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965.
    This organization adapted the principles of Islam as its ideological
    guideline. However, its members interpretation of Islam was revolutionary
    and they believed in armed struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued
    Marxism as a progressive method for economic and social analysis but
    considered Islam as their source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In
    the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its members were imprisoned
    and executed. In 1975, following a deep ideological crisis, the
    organization refuted Islam as its ideology and, after a few of its members
    were killed and other Muslim members purged, the organization proclaimed
    Marxism as its ideology. This move led to split of the Marxist-Leninist
    Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim
    leaders of the MKO were released along with other political prisoners.
    They began to re-organize the MKO and recruit new members based on Islamic
    ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic
    Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and
    supported the Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and
    infiltration of governmental institutions were foremost on the
    organization s agenda. During the first two years after the Revolution,
    the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high
    schools and universities; but its efforts to gain political power, either
    by appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic
    leaders. (1) Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic
    of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of politically
    motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the 1979
    Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the country
    have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of
    individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of
    the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however,
    these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since then, both
    inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far
    identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases there has not been much published and
    the local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
    evidence, and traces obtained through investigations conducted by local
    police and judicial authorities confirm, however, the theory of state
    committed crimes. In certain cases, these investigations have resulted in
    the expulsion or arrest of Iranian diplomats. In limited cases outside
    Iran, the perpetrators of these murders have been arrested and put on
    trial and the evidence presented, revealed the defendants connection to
    Iran s government institutions, and an arrest warrant has been issued for
    Iran s Minister of Information. The manner in which these killings were
    organized and implemented in Iran and abroad, is indicative of a single
    pattern which, according to Roland Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor,
    contains common parameters and detailed planning. It can be ascertained
    from the similarities between these murders in different countries that
    the Iranian government is the principal entity who ordered the
    implementation of these crimes. Iranian authorities have not officially
    accepted responsibility for these murders and have even attributed their
    commission to internal strife in opposition groups. Nevertheless, since
    the very inception of the Islamic Republic regime, the Islamic Republic
    officials have justified these crimes from an ideological and legal
    standpoint. In the spring of 1979, Sadeq Khalkhali, the first C
