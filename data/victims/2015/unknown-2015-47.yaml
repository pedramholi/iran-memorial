    News of the execution of an unknown individual along with three others was
    announced by the website of HRANA on February 15, 2015. The case of these
    defendants pertains to crimes connected to murder or armed robbery.
    However, it is not clear exactly what crime was committed by whom. Arrest
    and detention There is no information available on the details of this
    unknown individual s arrest and detention. Trial There is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of this unknown
    individual s trial. Charges This unknown individual and the other three
    were charged with murder and armed robbery. However, the report does not
    clarify exactly what crime was committed by this unknown individual. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    available on the details of the evidence of guilt entered against this
    unknown individual. Defense There is no information available on the
    details of this unknown individual s defense. Judgment The court sentenced
    this unknown individual to death. This unknown individual was hanged,
    along with the three others, in the courtyard of Shiraz s Adelabad Prison
    on the morning of February 15, 2015. There is no further information
    available on the details of this verdict.
