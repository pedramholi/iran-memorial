    News of the execution of Mr. A. Keimasi Salkhuri was published on the
    websites of Qazvin Provincial Courthouse, Mehrnews, Fars news agency, and
    many other websites, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Qazvin
    Provincial Courthouse on January 6, 2015. Arrest and Detention According
    to the Public Relations Office of the Qazvin Provincial Courthouse, Mr.
    Keimasi Salkhuri was arrested in connection with a collective fight that
    took place at a traditional garden in Qazvin resulting in a murder on July
    5, 2010. Trial No information is available on Mr. Keimasi Salkhuri s
    trial. Charges According to the Head of the Qazvin Provincial Courthouse,
    the charge against Mr. Keimasi Salkhuri was "murder." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Keimasi Salkhuri was his confession to
    stabbing the victim in the chest, and his possession of the knife.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense During the interrogation, Mr. Keimasi Salkhuri
    stated that he had consumed tranquilizers on the day of the fight.
    However, no information is available on his defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. A. Keimasi Salkhuri to death and the Supreme Court confirmed
    the ruling. The ruling was carried out on January 6, 2015 when he was
    hanged at the Qazvin Central Prison yard.
