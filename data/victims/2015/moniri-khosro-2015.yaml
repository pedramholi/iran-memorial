    News of the execution of Mr. Khosro Moniri, along with four others, was
    published on the websites of Kurdpa and Mafnews on February 16, 2015. He
    was a Kurd from the Kolhar Village near Orumieh in the Azarbaijan-e Gharbi
    province. (Kurdpa) Arrest and detention Mr. Moniri was detained at Section
    15 of the Darya Prison in Orumieh. The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Moniri s
    trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Moniri was announced as
    dealing narcotics. No specific information is available on his charge. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Moniri. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Moniri s defense. Judgment Mr. Khosro Moniri was hanged in the Orumieh
    Central Prison on February 16, 2015 at dawn. No specific information is
    available about this execution.
