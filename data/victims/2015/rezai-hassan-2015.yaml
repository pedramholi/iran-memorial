    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan Reza i, along with 26 others, was sent
    by an informed source to the Boroumand Foundation on April 16, 2015.
    According to this source, close to 171 individuals had been executed in
    relation to narcotics in Iran s prisons between April 12 and 14, 2015. All
    of these individuals were involved in dealing narcotics and most had a
    drug lab (kitchen*) in their homes. Arrest and detention Mr. Reza i was
    imprisoned at Unit 2 in the Qezelhesar Prison. The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Reza i s trial. Charges According to the Boroumand Foundation, quoting
    an informed source, the charges brought against Mr. Reza i were related to
    dealing and producing narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Reza i. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Reza i s defense. Judgment Mr. Hamed Reza
    i was hanged, along with 14 others, at the Qezelhesar Prison in Karaj on
    April 13, 2015. ------------------------------------ *Kitchen is referred

    mainly used for purifying drugs and making several industrial drugs such
    as crystal.
