    News of the execution of Mr. Mansur Yusefi Hashtiani was published on the

    Village near Orumieh in the Azarbaijan-e Gharbi province. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Yusefi Hashtiani was detained in Section 15 of the Orumieh
    Central Prison. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Yusefi Hashtiani s trial.
    Charges The charges brought against Mr. Yusefi Hashtiani were announced as
    transportation and selling narcotics. No specific information is available
    on his charge. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Yusefi Hashtiani. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Yusefi Hashtiani s defense. Judgment Mr.
    Mansur Yusefi Hashtiani was hanged in the Orumieh Central Prison on August
    3, 2015. He had been transferred to solitary confinement since April 19,
    2015. No specific information is available about this execution.
