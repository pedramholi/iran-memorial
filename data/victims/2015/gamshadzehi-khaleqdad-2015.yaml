    News of the execution of Mr. Khaleqdad Gamshadzehi, along with three
    others, was published on the websites of HRANA (Human Rights Activists
    News Agency), and the Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran, with
    the name of Khaledvand Gomshahzehi, on March 16, 2015. Mr. Gamshadzehi was
    60 years old. Arrest and detention According to the Human Rights and
    Democracy Activists in Iran, Mr. Gamshadzehi was detained in the Zahedan
    Central Prison. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Gamshadzehi s trial.
    Charges According to HRANA, the charge brought against Mr. Gamshadzehi was
    announced as crimes related to narcotics. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Gamshadzehi.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Gamshadzehi s defense. Judgment
    Mr. Khaleqdad Gamshadzehi was hanged, along with three others, at Zahedan
    Prison on March 7, 2015.
