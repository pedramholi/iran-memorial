circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. M. S. was published in the Khorasan newspaper
    on January 20, 2015. This case was related to the murder of a young man in
    the Torqabeh-Shandiz area near Mashhad during a collective fight in the
    summer of 2008. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on
    Mr. M. S. s arrest and detention. Trial Branch Five of the Khorasan-e
    Razavi Criminal Court tried Mr. M. S. No further information is available
    on his trial. Charges The charge against Mr. M. S. was announced as
    "murder." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against Mr. M. S.
    was his clear confession during the interrogation, the coroner s office
    report, and the reconstruction of the murder scene in the presence of the
    Torqabeh-Shandi interrogator. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. M. S.'s defense. Judgment Branch Five of the Khorasan-e Razavi
    Criminal Court condemned Mr. M. S. to death and Branch 28 of the Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in the presence of the judicial
    and other officials in the Torqabeh Prison on January 19, 2015.
