    democratic, ecologic, and gender equal society in a democratic and federal
    Iran with self-determination for ethnic minorities. Its first congress
    took place on April 25, 2004. This party, headed by Abdollrahman
    Hajiahmadi, has a close connection with the PKK in Turkey and considers
    the PKK leader, Abdollah Ojalan (Apu), as its inspirational leader. PJAK
    has influence mostly in the northern Kurdistan region of Iran and fights
    the Islamic Republic militarily. PJAK refers to Kurdistan of Iran as
    Eastern Kurdistan. The Free Life Party of Kurdistan (PJAK) and the

    Kurdistan (PJAK), published a statement indicating that in response to the
    execution of Mr. Najavi, they attacked the Revolutionary Guards base in
