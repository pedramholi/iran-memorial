    News of the execution of Mr. Hamid, without a last name, along with two
    others, was published on the websites of Jamejamonline on February 19, and
    Javanonline on February 20, 2015. Mr. Hamid, 23, was an Afghan citizen.
    According to the existing information, he had murdered a 25-year-old man
    with a knife while defending his brother during a fight on September 27,
    2007. Arrest and detention According to the Jamejamonline report, Mr.
    Hamid escaped the scene and was arrested two days later on September 29,
    2007. However, according to the Javanonline report and his confession
    during the interrogation, agents of the Moshirieh Police Station arrested
    Mr. Hamid at the scene on September 27, 2007 and transferred him to the
    Intelligence Police for interrogation. He was detained for seven years.
    Trial Branch 71 of the Criminal Court of Tehran Province tried Mr. Hamid.
    No information is available on his trial. Charges According to the
    existing information, the charge brought against Mr. Hamid was announced
    as murdering an Afghan young man. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Hamid was his confession during the interrogation.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense During the interrogation, Mr. Hamid stated that he
    got involved in the fight to defend his hospitalized addicted brother who
    was beaten by the victim and another man. The victim who was injured
    during the fight, also attacked Mr. Hamid and injured his leg. Judgment
    Branch 71 of the Criminal Court of Tehran Province condemned Mr. Hamid to
    death and Branch 27 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged at the Raja ishahr (Gohardasht) Prison yard in Karaj on February
    18, 2015.
