    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad L. along with three other* was
    announced by the website of the provincial Ministry of Justice Office of
    Markazi Province on April 12, 2015. His case pertains to crimes connected
    to illegal drugs. Arrest and detention There is no information available
    on the details of Mr. Mohammad L. s arrest and detention. Trial According
    to the available information, Mr. Mohammad L. was tried by Branch Two of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Arak. However, there is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of Mr. Mohammad L. s
    trial. Charges The court charged Mr. Mohammad L. with possessing 667 grams
    of heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on the details of the evidence of guilt
    entered against Mr. Mohammad L. Defense There is no information available
    on the details of Mr. Mohammad L. s defense. Judgment The court sentenced
    Mr. Mohammad L. to death. The verdict was validated by the Chief Public
    Prosecutor, and later the head of the Judiciary enforced it. Mr. Mohammad
    L. was hanged in Arak Central Prison on the morning of April 12, 2015.
