    News of the execution of Mr. Sa id Hajilu, along with 20 others, was
    published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on
    March 4 and 5, 2015. Only six names were published in this report. News of
    this execution was not published in the official media. Arrest and
    detention According to the existing information, Mr. Hajilu had probably
    been detained at the Greater Tehran Detention Center before being
    transferred to solitary confinement in Qezelhesar Prison on March 3, 2015.
    According to HRANA, he had his last visitation with his family at the
    Qezelhesar Prison. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Hajilu s trial. Charges
    According to HRANA, the charges against Mr. Hajilu were announced as
    crimes related to narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Hajilu. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Hajilu s defense. Judgment Mr. Sa id Hajilu was hanged at the
    Qezelhesar Prison yard in Karaj on Wednesday March 4, 2015 at dawn.
