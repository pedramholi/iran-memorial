    News of the execution of Mr. Khosro Rostami, along with another person,
    was published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency)
    on January 24, 2015. According to this report, seven prisoners were
    executed but only two names were announced. Official media did not publish
    news of these executions. Mr. Rostami was from the village of Mishi in
    Hormozgan province. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information
    on Mr. Rostami s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available
    on Mr. Rostami s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Rostami were
    announced as "transportation and possession of two kilograms narcotics."

    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Rostami. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Rostami's defense. Judgment Mr. Khosro Rostami was hanged at the Minab
    Prison yard on January 24, 2015.
