    News of the execution of Mr. Shahin (no last name announced) was announced
    by the websites of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Yazd
    Province (April 12, 2015), Sharq and E temad dallies (April 13, 2015), and
    Khabar-e Jonoub (April 14, 2015). Additional information on this case was
    obtained from the websites of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of
    Yazd Province (November 2 December 8, 2014) and Iran daily (November 5-9,
    2014). Mr. Shahin was from the city of Mehriz in Yazd Province, and he was
    also a resident of the city. This case pertains to the rape and murder of
    achild on October 30, 2014. Arrest and detention Mr. Shahin was arrested
    on November 2, 2014 in the course of the police investigation of the
    disappearance of a 9-year old child in the city of Mehriz. On October 30,
    a family in Mehriz informed the police that their 9-year old child, who
    had gone to participate in the Moharram Mourning Ceremonies at the
    Hosseinieh of the neighborhood at 9 PM, was missing. In the course of the
    police investigation, witnesses stated that they had seen the child on the
    back of a bike of an unknown biker. Mr. Shahin was consequently arrested
    in the course of police investigation as the suspect, and was
    interrogated. He initially denied any knowledge of the incident. However,
    after some evidence had been found in his home, he admitted to murdering
    the child, putting his corpse in a sackcloth, and discarding it at the
    garbage disposal site, in the vicinity of the city. Mr. Shahin was held in
    prison until April 2015. Trial Mr. Shahin was tried by the Public Court of
    Yazd Province. The first-degree blood relatives of the victim asked the
    court for maximum punishment of Mr. Shahin. However, there is no
    information available on the details of the session or sessions of his
    trial. Charges The court charged Mr. Shahin with rape and murder. He was
    accused of deceiving, kidnapping, raping and murdering a 9-year old child.
    According to the report, Mr. Shahin tricked the child, who was going to
    Muharram Mourning Ceremonies, into mounting his bike. Then, on the pretext
    that he would want to give one of the fish in the pool of his house to the
    child, took the child to his house, raped, and then killed the child by
    hitting him/her hard in the throat. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    discovery of blood drops, as well as the bloody clothes of the child, in
    the course of the police investigation of the house of Mr. Shahin, was
    among the pieces of evidence that were entered against him. In addition,
    there were his eventual confession to the crime and the corpse of the
    child that was found through his instructions. The court also declared
    that Mr. Shaeen had been of sound mind when committing the crime. Defense
    There is no information available on the details of Mr. Shahin s defense.
    Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Shahin to death. The verdict was
    validated by the Supreme Court. After the head of the Judiciary had also
    approved the verdict, Mr. Shahin was publicly hanged on the spot where the
    corpse of the victim had been found, near the city of Mehriz, in the
    presence of judicial, police, and security authorities on April 12, 2015.
