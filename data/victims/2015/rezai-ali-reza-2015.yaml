    Information regarding the death in detention of Mr. Ali Reza Reza i was
    taken from three interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation with his relative, who was with him until the last moments of
    his life; with Mr. Ali Hezareh, an Afghan documentary film maker residing
    in Paris; with Mr. Reza i s sister in October of 2015; and the official
    statement by his family. Additional information was gathered from the
    websites of RFI on September 26, 2015 and Deutsche Welle Persian on May
    13, 2013 and September 14, 2015. Mr. Reza i was arrested on September 20,
    2015 while crossing the Turkish border illegally along with six others. He
    died in detention after being led to the border station several hours
    later. Mr. Reza i was born in Tehran into an Afghan family who migrated to
    Iran in 1979. He was single and 24 years old. He had primary education and
    lived in Pakdasht near Varamin in Tehran Province until 2004. He then
    moved to Afghanistan along with his family and resided in Kabul. He left
    school and began graphic and artistic work and after completing a course
    in montage, he entered the movie industry. He worked at National Radio and
    Television in Afghanistan for a period. He also worked at the Afghanistan
    Cultural House and at an independent cultural center as a sound recordist
    and director s assistant. He lost his mother in 2008 and helped his
    father, who was a well-known metalsmith in Afghanistan and owned a large
    factory which made safes. They had a factory in Kabul, but when his father
    died in 2012, Mr. Reza i experienced the problems facing the industry and
    his father s wealth disappeared. He decided to migrate to Europe and
    re-entered Iran legally. However, without committing any crime, he was
    arrested in Orumieh and his passport was cut up. The apparent reason for
    this was that Afghans were forbidden to enter Azerbaijan-e Gharbi
    province. He was detained at Sefidsang Camp* for several days under hard
    condition and then deported to Afghanistan where unfavorable living
    conditions forced him to migrate once more. Since he could not get another
    passport to enter Iran legally, he entered illegally over the Zahedan
    border. He stayed with his sister in Iran for seven months. Finally, due
    to a lack of work permit and difficulties of life in Iran, he decided
    again to leave for Europe. (interview with Mr. Ali Hezareh) Background
    Iran has long been host to one of the largest displaced populations in the
    world due to its 937 kilometer border and common language with a large
    part of the Afghan population. Millions who fled conflict and repression
    during the late 1970s and early 1980s when the Soviet Union occupied
    Afghanistan, or during the civil war and especially after the Taliban took
    power in 1996, left their homeland and mostly fled to Pakistan and Iran.
    Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, emphasized
    hosting Afghans in 1979. Therefore, Iran gave asylum and some assistance
    to Afghan refugees from 1979 to 1992. However, after the Afghan Mojahedin
    came to power in 1992, the Iranian government began encouraging and
    pressuring Afghans to return to Afghanistan through various measures,
    including the implementation of onerous procedures for renewing refugee
    papers, refusal to register newly arriving Afghans as refugees, and denial
    of public services to refugees. As a result, about a million Afghans
    returned to their homeland in a short period. This policy has continued up
    to now in spite of increasing Afghan migration caused by dire security
    condition in Afghanistan since 2008. Authorities arrest undocumented
    Afghans and detain them in camps assigned for aliens before returning them
    to their country. Meanwhile, the United Nations offered financial
    assistance to the Iranian government in order to support minimum living
    conditions for refugees and their voluntarily return.** Arrest and
    detention Mr. Reza i was arrested by border patrol agents near the Turkish
    border while attempting to leave Iran illegally along with a group of his
    family members on September 20, 2015 at 3:00 A.M. All his companions -
    including a 10-year-old, a 12-year-old, a 19-year-old girl, and three
    youngsters aged between 18 and 25 - were arrested and led to the border
    station. (RFI on September 26, 2015) According to his companion s
    interview and his family s statement, after hours of mountain climbing and
    the surprise attack and shooting by the border patrol, Mr. Reza i felt
    exhausted and ill. In spite of this, agents forced him and the rest of the
    group to climb on for another half an hour to reach the border station.
    When a companion realized that Mr. Reza i was not feeling well and asked
    soldiers to rest, agents beat him and Mr. Reza i. According to his sister,
    who was among the companions, soldiers subjected Mr. Reza i to several
    minutes of fist punches and kicks; one such kick to Reza i s chest would
    prove life-threatening. The severity of beating was such that Mr. Reza i
    passed out and laid on the ground wit
