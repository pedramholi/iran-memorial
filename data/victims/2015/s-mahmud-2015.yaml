    News of the execution of Mr. Mahmud S., along with three other
    individuals*, was announced by the website of the provincial Ministry of
    Justice office of Markazi Province on April 12, 2015. His case pertains to
    crimes connected to illegal drugs. Arrest and detention There is no
    information available on the details of Mr. Mahmud S. s arrest and
    detention. Trial According to the available information, Mr. Mahmud S. was
    tried by Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Arak. However,
    there is no information available on the details of the session or
    sessions of his trial. Charges The court charged Mr. Mahmud S. with
    carrying 20 grams and storing 880 grams of heroin. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on the
    details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr. Mahmud S. Defense
    There is no information available on the details of Mr. Mahmud S. s
    defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Mahmud S. to death. The issued
    verdict was validated by the Supreme Court, and later enforced by the head
    of the Judiciary. Mr. Mahmud S. was hanged in Arak Central Prison on April
    12, 2015. ------------------------ *Messers: Hamed N., Ne'matollah N., and
