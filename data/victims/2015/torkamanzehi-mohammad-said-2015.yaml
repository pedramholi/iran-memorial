    Mr. Mohammad Sa'id Torkamanzehi was a primary school teacher and a skilled
    soccer player. He was religious and non-violent. The religious and
    national repression imposed by the government in Baluchestan prompted him
    to flee Iran, and this escape ultimately led him down a path that resulted
    in his death. The news and information regarding the extrajudicial
    execution of Mr. Mohammad Sa id Torkmanzehi, known as Mullah Moaz, the son
    of Jamal Khatun and Kheir Mohammad, were obtained through an interview
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with one of his relatives
    (14 Nov 2021 and 27 June 2022), along with his friend and fellow party
    member (27 Nov 2021, 7 Dec 2021, 25 Nov 2023), and Fars news agency (21
    and 25 April 2015). Additional information about this assassination was
    gathered from the official website of Jaish al-Adl Edalat News (11 May
    2015), the official news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran-IRNA (22
    and 23 April 2015), articles related to the Jama at Tablighi movement*,
    and a religious question-and-answer search engine. Mr. Torkamanzehi, born
    on January 21, 1969, in Saravan city of Sistan and Baluchestan province,
    was a Baloch and a Sunni religious person. He was married and had eight
    children. Serving as the principal of the elementary school in Bam Posht
    village of Saravan, he was not only an educator but also an athlete
    actively involved in football. Additionally, he managed a football club in
    Saravan City. A relative described him as religious, knowledgeable, and
    deeply engaged in religious activities. His religious journey began at the
    age of 15 when he joined the Jama at Tablighi (Society of Preachers)
    movement. (ABC interview, 27 Nov 2021). Engaging in meetings, particularly
    with the youth, he highlighted the struggles and national-religious
    discrimination faced by the people of Sistan and Baluchestan. Actively
    involved, he traveled to different cities, including Tehran, Mashhad, and
    Turkmen Sahara, to address these issues. Consequently, he faced various
    forms of pressure from security forces, including restrictions on leaving
    Sistan and Baluchestan province. (ABC interview, 27 June 2021) According
    to one of his relatives, in March 2006, security forces planned to arrest
    Mr. Torkamanzehi by raiding his home in Bam Posht village, but he was not
    present. After learning of this incident, he fled the country illegally
    and moved to Pakistan by the end of March of the same year. He settled in
    the city of Panjgur near the Iran-Pakistan border and continued his
    religious activities within the Jama at Tablighi framework. Through his
    friends' mediation, he had several meetings with Abdolmalek Rigi, the
    leader of Jondollah, and eventually, at Abdolmalek's request in 2007-2008,
    he joined Jondollah. According to his friend, he had no connection with
    Jondollah before fleeing to Pakistan. (ABC interview, 25 Nov 2023) Mr.
    Torkmanzehi joined the Jeish-al-Adl organization after its establishment
    in 2012. From 2014 until his death, he served as the spokesperson for
    Jeish-al-Adl. During this period, he conducted interviews with various TV
    channels discussing the economic, social, and political situation of the
    Baloch people and the policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning
    the people of Sistan and Baluchestan. (ABC interview, 27 Nov 2023 and
    Edalat news, 21 April 2015). As a teacher in these two parties, he taught
    Farsi language to the children of the members of this organization. He
    instructed social and educational issues to the members of these parties.
    (ABC interview, 25 Nov 2023). According to Mr. Torkamanzehi's friend, he
    was a religious, well-spoken, well-mannered, and studious person. He was a
    straightforward individual and did not pay much attention to the safety of
    his life. (ABC interview, 27 Nov 2023) The Situation of Iran s Baluch
    Population Baluch ethnics make up one to three percent of the country s
    population and the majority in Sistan and Baluchistan, where 64-77 percent
    of residents live below the poverty line. Despite having abundant gas,
    oil, gold, and marine resources, approximately two thirds of residents
    lack access to clean drinking water. Economic policies have caused Sistan
    and Baluchistan Province to remain one of the most deprived provinces in
    terms of education, health, and food. (Boroumand Center research). Iran's
    Baluch minority are mostly Sunni Muslims, whereas the majority of Iran s
    population are Shi'a Muslims. Policies and actions from authorities have
    been restrictive toward the practice of Sunni Islam, e.g. limiting and
    even blocking the construction of Sunni mosques in majority-Sh ia areas
    (including Tehran), arbitrary closure of Sunni prayer halls and
    celebratory gatherings, and violence from security forces towards groups
    of Sunnis praying in public (Minority Rights Group; Human Rights Watch:
    Religious Minorities; Al-Monitor). Baluch activists have reported that
    government repression of Sunni Baluch groups had increased since February
    1994, when loc
