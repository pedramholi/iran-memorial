    News of the execution of Mr. Kh. Ahmadi was published on the websites of
    Qazvin General Courthouse and News Central Unit on May 13, 2015, quoting
    the Public Relations Office of the Qazvin General Courthouse. He resided
    in Takestan and worked in a bakery. His case and the case of another
    person were related to the murder of a man at his house in Qazvin on April
    1, 2009. Arrest and detention Mr. Ahmadi was arrested by police in the
    spring of 2009 (websites of Qazvin General Courthouse). The circumstances
    of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch Two of the
    Criminal Court of Qazvin tried Mr. Ahmadi. No information is available on
    his trial. Charges According to the Public Relations Office of the Qazvin
    General Courthouse, the charges brought against Mr. Ahmadi were announced
    as murder, and sub-adulterous illegitimate relationship. According to the
    websites of Qazvin General Courthouse, in collaboration with the victim s
    wife, Mr. Ahmadi had murdered the husband. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Ahmadi was his confession and the
    confession of the victim s wife. According to the existing reports, police
    tapped the phone of the victim s wife and found out about their
    relationship. Then they forced them to confess. Additionally, having a
    previous record, the forensics report, and reconstruction of the crime
    scene by the defendant were considered evidence against him. (websites of
    Qazvin General Courthouse) International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Ahmadi s defense. Judgment Branch Two of the Criminal Court of Qazvin
    condemned Mr. Kh. Ahmadi to death for murder and to 99 lashes for
    adultery. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and the Head of judiciary
    approved it. He was hanged in the presence of the victim s family at the
    Qazvin Central Prison on May 13, 2015. The other defendant was condemned
    to 8 years imprisonment and 99 lashes.
