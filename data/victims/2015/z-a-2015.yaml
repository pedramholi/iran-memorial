    News of the execution of a person named as A. Z., along with another
    person, was published on the website of Hamadan Provincial Courthouse on
    January 4, 2015. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on
    A. Z. s arrest and detention. Trial Branch One of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Hamadan tried A. Z. No information is available on
    his trial. Charges The charge against A. Z. was announced as "drug
    trafficking." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against A. Z. Defense No information is available on A. Z.'s
    defense. Judgment Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Hamadan
    condemned A. Z. to death. The General Public Prosecutor s Office and the
    Deputy of the Judiciary confirmed the ruling. The defendant was hanged in
    Hamadan. The exact date of this execution is unknown.
