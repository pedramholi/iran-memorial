    News of the execution of Mr. A. M., son of Yekeh, born in Tehran, along
    with three others, was published on the website of Gilan Provincial
    Courthouse, quoting the Public Relations Office of this courthouse on
    January 31, 2015. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on
    Mr. A. M. s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    A. M. s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. A. M. were announced as
    "having a multiple criminal record and transporting 5 kilograms and 750
    grams of methamphetamine." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. A. M. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. A. M.'s defense. Judgment A court in Rasht condemned Mr.
    A. M. to death. The Supreme Court and the Head of the Judiciary confirmed
    the ruling. Twice the Amnesty and Pardon Commission denied the defendant s
    pardon request. The ruling was carried out in the presence of officials
    and he was hanged in the Rasht Central Prison on January 31, 2015. His
    body was transferred to the morgue to be given to his relatives.
