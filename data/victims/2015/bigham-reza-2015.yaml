    News of the execution of Mr. Reza Bigham was published on the website of
    HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on January 31, 2015. Official
    media did not publish news of this execution. Arrest and Detention
    According to the report, Mr. Bigham was detained for 12 years. There is no
    specific information on his arrest and detention. Trial The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Kerman tried Mr. Bigham. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Bigham were
    announced as "transportation and participation in supplying narcotics."
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Bigham. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Bigham's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Kerman
    condemned Mr. Reza Bigham to death. The ruling was carried out after 12
    years on Thursday January 29, 2015 when he was hanged at the Bam Prison
    yard.
