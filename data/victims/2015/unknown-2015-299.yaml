    News of the execution of an unknown person, along with 24 others, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on June 17 2015. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of the defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    According to the newspaper report, these defendants were tried in
    Revolutionary and Public Courts. No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges The charges brought against most of these
    defendants were announced as transportating and trafficking narcotics. No
    information is available on details of the defendant s charge. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant s defense. Judgment The court condemned the defendant to
    death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. The defendant s pardon
    request was denied by the judiciary committee. The defendant was hanged at
    the Raja ishahr Prison yard on June 16, 2015 in the morning. No specific
    information is available about the defendant s execution.
