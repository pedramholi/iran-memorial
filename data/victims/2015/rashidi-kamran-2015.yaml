    News of the execution of Mr. Kamran Rashidi, son of Dinu, was published on
    the website of Kurdpa, the Kurdistan Press Agency, on October 12, 2015. He
    was a Kurdish citizen. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Rashidi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Rashidi s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr.
    Rashidi was dealing narcotics. No detailed information is available on his
    charge. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Rashidi. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Rashidi s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Kamran Rashidi
    to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at the
    Darya Prison yard in Orumieh on October 12, 2015 at dawn. No specific
    information is available about his execution.
