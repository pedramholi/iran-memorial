    News of the execution of Mr. Javad (Bahram) Saberi, along with four
    others, was published on the websites of Jam-e Jam on April 16, 2015,
    Javanonline on April 17, 2015, and the Iran Human Rights Organization on
    May 3, 2015. His case was related to the death of a 17-year-old worker due
    to severe bleeding caused by knife wounds, and injuring of two others, in
    a restaurant in Eslamshahr on September 21, 2008. Mr. Saberi was a worker
    at the restaurant and less than 18 years old at the time of the committed
    crime. International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment
    against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the
    crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
    Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid
    capital punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Saberi was arrested by police agents of Station
    11 in Eslamshahr in a northern city (Javanonline). According to the Iran
    Human Rights Organization, he was arrested and taken to the prison on
    September 24, 2008. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial Branch 74 of the Tehran Criminal Court tried Mr. Saberi. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Saberi was announced as murder. (Jamejam and Javanonline) According to
    the Iran Human Rights Organization, he was additionally charged with
    possession of methamphetamines. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Saberi was his confession and testimonies
    of the restaurant s workers (Jamejam and Javanonline), and possession of
    20 centigrams of methamphetamine. (Iran Human Rights Organization)
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense According to the Iran Human Rights Organization, Mr.
    Saberi was 17 years and 10 months old when the incident occurred and was
    not 18. He also suffered from a psychological illness and had been
    hospitalized at Aminabad Psychiatric Facility for a period before his
    execution. A Summary of the Defects of Mr. Javad Saberi s Legal
    Proceedings According to certain reports, Javad Saberi was 17 years and 10
    months old at the time of the murder. Although the age of criminal
    responsibility in Iranian law is the age where an individual reaches
    puberty, and Mr. Saberi had reached puberty at the time of the murder, the
    change in the Islamic Penal Code in 2013, provides individuals under the
    age of 18 with the possibility of being exempt from the death penalty.
    Pursuant to Article 91 of said Law, In crimes requiring Hadd or Qesas, if
    the individuals under the age of 18 who have attained puberty cannot
    comprehend the nature of the crime or the prohibition thereof, or if there
    is doubt as to their mental development [and capacity] and maturity, they
    will be sentenced to the punishments prescribed in this chapter on a case
    by case basis. In order to ascertain mental development and maturity, the
    court may obtain the medical examiner s opinion, or utilize any other
    method it deems appropriate. Although the murder occurred prior to the
    passage of said Law, the Law does, however, apply retroactively, and
    covers final judgments issued prior to the passage of the Law. According
    to a Supreme Court General Council Uniform Procedure Decision, Whereas
    Article 10(b) of the Islamic Penal Code of April 21, 2013 provides for
    exemption from crimes requiring Hadd and Qesas punishments in said Article
    s opening provision, and whereas the powers prescribed for the sentence
    implementation judge in amending a sentence and/or the convicted
    individual s right to ask the court for a reduced sentence as provided for
    in said paragraph is not in conflict with the Law on General and
    Revolutionary Courts Rules of Criminal Procedure Article 272, Paragraph 7,
    and does not nullify the same, therefore, in the event that individuals
    sentenced to Qesas, who were under the age of 18 at the time of the
    commission of the crime and the final sentences in t
