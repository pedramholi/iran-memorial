    News of the execution of Mr. Safdar (without a last name), along with four
    others, was published on the websites of Jam-e Jam on April 16, 2015,
    Javanonline on April 17, 2015, and the Iran Human Rights Organization on
    May 3, 2015. According to the existing information, his case was related
    to the murder of an individual on May 8, 2011. On May 11, 2011, the
    Robatkarim police agents were informed by neighbors of the murder of a
    30-year-old man in a house around Salehabad. Arrest and detention The
    Robatkarim police agents arrested Mr. Safdar. The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 74 of the Tehran Criminal
    Court tried Mr. Safdar. No information is available on his trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Safdar was announced as murdering a
    30-year-old man. He had murdered the victim with blows of a stick in order
    to steal his car. (Jam-e Jam) The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Safdar was his confession. (Javanonline)
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Safdar s defense.
    Judgment Branch 74 of the Tehran Criminal Court condemned Mr. Safdar to
    death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along
    with four others, at the Gohardasht Prison yard in Karaj on April 16,
    2015.
