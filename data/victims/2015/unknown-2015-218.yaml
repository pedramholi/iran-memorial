    News of the execution of an unknown man, along with two others, was
    published on the websites of the Hamadan Provincial Courthouse and Hamadan
    News on May 12, 2015, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Hamadan
    Provincial Courthouse. According to this source, these executions took
    place to combat the distribution of narcotics. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this unknown man s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Hamadan tried this unknown man.
    No information is available on his trial. Charges According to the Public
    Relations Office of the Hamadan Provincial Courthouse, the charge brought
    against the defendant was announced as distribution of narcotics in the
    Hamadan province. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Hamadan condemned the defendant to death, the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling and the Head of Judiciary validated it. He was
    hanged, along with two others, at the Hamadan Central Prison on May 10,
    2015.
