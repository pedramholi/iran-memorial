    News of the execution of Mr. Hamid Mir Baluchzehi was published on the
    websites of Central News Unit on March 5, 2015 and Baluch Activists
    Campaign on March 6, 2015. According to the existing information, he was
    from Iranshahr in the Sistan Va Baluchistan province. Arrest and detention
    According to the Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of the Sistan Va
    Baluchistan province, Mr. Mir Baluchzehi was arrested and transferred to
    the prison in 2012. (Central News Unit) The circumstances of his arrest
    and detention are not known. According to the Baluch Activists Campaign
    report, quoting a relative, Mr. Mir Baluchzehi had his last visitation
    with his family on March 4, 2015. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Mir Baluchzehi s trial. Charges According to the Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor of the Sistan Va Baluchistan province, the charge brought
    against Mr. Mir Baluchzehi was announced as transportation of crack.
    (Central News Unit) The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The evidence presented against Mr. Mir Baluchzehi was transporting 8
    kilograms of crack when arrested. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Mir Baluchzehi s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hamid Mir
    Baluchzehi to death and the General Public Prosecution Office confirmed
    the ruling. He was hanged at the Central Prison of the Boyerahmad
    Va-Kohkiluyeh province in Yassuj on Thursday at dawn on March 5, 2015.
    According to a relative, the body of Mr. Mir Baluchzehi was transferred to
    Zahedan and buried there. (Central News Unit)
