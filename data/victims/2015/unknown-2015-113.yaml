    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet

    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
