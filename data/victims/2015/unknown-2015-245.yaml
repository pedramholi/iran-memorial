    News of the execution of an unknown man was published on the website of
    the Ardebil Provincial Courthouse on May 23, 2015, quoting the Public
    Relations Office of the Ardebil Provincial Courthouse. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this unknown man s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ardebil
    tried this unknown man. No information is available on his trial. Charges
    According to the Public Relations Office of the Ardebil Provincial
    Courthouse, the charge brought against the defendant was announced as
    purchasing and possession of heroin and methamphetamine. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against the defendant was
    possession of 990 grams of heroin and 995 grams of methamphetamine.
    Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment
    Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ardebil condemned the
    defendant to death. The General Public Prosecutor and the Head of
    Judiciary confirmed the ruling. The defendant was hanged in the Ardebil
    Prison on May 23, 2015 in the morning. Twice the Pardon Committee of the
    Judiciary denied his pardon request.
