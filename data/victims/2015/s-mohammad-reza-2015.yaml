    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza S., along with four others, was
    published on the website of Central Provincial Courthouse on January 14,
    2015. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on Mr.
    Mohammad Reza S. s arrest and detention. Trial Branch Two of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Arak tried Mr. Mohammad Reza S. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Mohammad Reza S.
    were announced as "transportation and possession of 10 kilograms of heroin
    and having a criminal record." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Mohammad Reza S. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Mohammad Reza S.'s defense. Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Mohammad Reza S. to death and the General Public
    Prosecutor s Office confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in the Arak
    Central Prison on January 13, 2015.
