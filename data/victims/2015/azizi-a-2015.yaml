    News of the execution of Mr. A. Azizi was published on the websites of the
    Qazvin Provincial Courthouse, Fars news agency, and Mehrn news on January
    1, 2015, quoting the Public Relations Office of this courthouse. Mr. Azizi
    was married. Arrest and Detention According to the existing report,
    following investigations by police agents in Bu inzahra, Mr. Azizi was
    arrested along with his wife and daughter. They denied smuggling charges
    during the interrogation. There is no specific information about his
    arrest and detention. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qazvin
    tried Mr. Azizi. No information is available on his trial. Charges
    According to the report, the charge against Mr. Azizi was announced as
    "dealing narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The evidence announced against Mr. Azizi was confessions by defendants,
    recovery of two kilograms and 967 grams of heroin, and reasons and
    apparent evidence. There is no description of this evidence. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Azizi's defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Qazvin condemned Mr. A. Azizi to death and the
    General Public Prosecutor s Office confirmed the ruling. He was hanged
    Qazvin on January 1, 2015 at dawn.
