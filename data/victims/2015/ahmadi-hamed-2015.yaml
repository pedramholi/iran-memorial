    Hamed Ahmadi: We went to our death 45 times. We said farewell to life 45
    times. Who can understand what it means to die 45 times? Who can
    understand what it means to put your head on the pillow 45 nights thinking
    it s the last night of your life? News of Mr. Hamed Ahmadi s execution
    along with five other individuals, was published by various sources
    including Kalemeh TV (March 4, 2015), HRANA (March 4, 2015), and Deutsche
    Welle Radio (March 4, 2015). The Judiciary Branch news agency (Mizan
    Online, March 4, 2015) also announced the news of the execution of six
    individuals in Rajai Shahr Prison, without stating their names. Additional
    information was obtained from an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation with Mr. Hamed Ahmadi, the spokesman for Sunni
    prisoners incarcerated at Rajai Shahr Prison, in the weeks leading up to
    the execution (ABF Interview), from video messages and audio interviews by
    prisoners, including Mr. Ahmadi, with television networks and other media
    from inside prison, and from other sources.* Mr. Ahmadi had a high school
    diploma, was married, and was a Sunni Kurd residing in [the city of]
    Sanandaj. He was the oldest son of his family and had a daughter. His job
    was selling cell phones. Mr. Ahmadi was a religious man and an adherent of
    the Shafe i** branch [of Islam]. He was active in Golshan Mosque near his
    home and in Zeynali Mosque near his place of work. According to his prison
    mate, he was a pleasant, forgiving, and patient man who spent a lot of
    time solving his prison mates problems, especially newcomers who had a lot
    of issues. He disseminated news from inside prison and was active in the
    media, and as the Sunni prisoners representative, provided them with news
    and information of what was going on inside the prison. Additionally, he
    studied in prison, conducted classes, and cooked. Every day at noon, Mr.
    Ahmadi would call his daughter Mahna from prison. According to his prison
    mate, every time his daughter would say I want six hundred and three
    Tumans (Iranian currency) she only knew that one number Mr. Ahmadi would
    have a lump in his throat. (ABF Interview) Mr. Ahmadi did not belong to
    any group or organization. He and the other prisoners sentenced to death
    were proselytizing the Shafe i**religion, and according to themselves,
    were trying to prevent people being taken advantage of in the name of
    religion. (Center for Supporters of Human Rights, May 4, 2014) Background
    Based on existing information, in the years 2007 to 2009-10, numerous
    insults were made by promoters of the Shi a religion against Sunni beliefs
    and individuals who commanded their respect, causing the reaction of Sunni
    religious personalities and activists. Following offensive remarks made by
    Ebrahim Hatamikia (famous Shi a film director) against Aisha (the Prophet
    Mohammad s wife) in an interview with Khanevadeh Sabz Magazine (Volume
    195, 2007), and statements made by well-known preachers including
    Hojjatoleslam Daneshmand, Hojjatoleslam Juybari, and Hojjatoleslam Ansari
    whose lectures were at times covered by state-run radio and television a
    number of religious Sunni youth from Kurdistan considered these insults to
    have been organized [by the state]. They started religious classes,
    distributing CD s and books in local mosques, universities, and their
    neighborhoods, and protested these actions, shedding light on [the
    motives], promoting and defending the principles of the Shafe i religion.
    These CD s included documented cases offensive to Sunni beliefs, quoting
    religious authoritative and reputable sources such as Bihar al-Anwar.
    These young people s religious activities aroused the security apparatus
    suspicions. Subsequent to Ayatollah Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj in May
    2009, a number of young Sunni Kurd religious activists were arrested in
    the name of the fight against Salafi and heretic movements. Three months
    after these arrests, [a number of] assassinations were carried out in
    Sanandaj, including those of Mamusta Shiekholeslam, member of the Assembly
    of Experts, and Molla Borjhan Aali, a Sunni cleric. The security forces
    accused individuals that had already been arrested prior theses
    assassinations. Although the charge of assassination was not brought up in
    court and the arrestees were tried for Moharebeh, the charge was,
    nevertheless, constantly mentioned on news media and by judicial and
    security officials. The defendants denied any and all relations with
    armed, radical, and extremist groups, objected to the charges brought
    against them and demanded an open re-trial, to which they got no response.
    Ultimately, six of the detainees were executed in January 2013 and another
    six on March 4, 2015. The issuance and implementation of the death
    sentence against this group of Sunni defendants caused much reaction by
    individuals and domestic and international institutions. In June 2014, 19
    human rights organizations objected to the sentences and demanded that
    they be revoked. Additionally, Amnesty
