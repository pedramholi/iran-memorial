    News of the execution of an unknown person, along with eleven others, was
    published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on
    April 20, 2015. Arrest and detention The circumstances of the defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. Charges The charge brought against the defendant
    was announced as related to narcotics. No information is available on
    details of his charge. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant s defense. Judgment The defendant was hanged in
    the Vakilabad Prison in Mashhad on April 16, 2015. No specific information
    is available about the defendant s execution.
