    News of the execution of Mr. Sajad Quchani, 27, born in Tehran, along with
    seven others, was published on the websites of Central News Unit on
    February 22, Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse on February 25, 2015 without
    naming him. However, the HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency)
    website published his name among the list of executed individuals on
    February 22, 2015. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information
    on Mr. Quchani s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available
    on Mr. Quchani s trial. Charges According to the website of Hormozgan
    Provincial Courthouse, quoting the Head of Hormozgan Provincial
    Courthouse, the charge against Mr. Quchani was "drug trafficking." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Quchani. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Quchani's defense. Judgment Mr. Sajad Quchani was hanged in Bandar-e Abbas
    on February 22, 2015. No further information is available regarding this
    execution.
