    News of the execution of Mr. Reza Niazi, along with 26 others, was sent by
    an informed source to the Boroumand Foundation on April 16, 2015.
    According to this source, close to 171 individuals had been executed in
    relation to narcotics in Iran s prisons between April 12 and 14, 2015. All
    of these individuals were involved in dealing narcotics and most had a
    drug lab (kitchen*) in their homes. News of this execution, along with
    seven others without naming them, was also published on the websites of
    the News Central Unit on April 13, and the Alborz Provincial Courthouse on
    April 14, 2015. Arrest and detention Mr. Niazi was imprisoned at Hall 4 in
    the Central Prison in Karaj. (Boroumand Foundation ) The circumstances of
    his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available
    on Mr. Niazi s trial. Charges According to the Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor of Karaj, Mr. Niazi and seven others were wholesalers and
    distributors of narcotics across the Alborz province, and he stated that
    some of these individuals were also active in producing narcotics. (Alborz
    Provincial Courthouse) The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of Karaj did not report any evidence
    presented against Mr. Niazi; however, he announced that over 3 kilograms
    of narcotics including methamphetamine and heroin had been recovered from
    these individuals. Defense No information is available on Mr. Niazi s
    defense. Judgment Mr. Reza Niazi was hanged, along with seven others, at
    the central Prison in Karaj on April 13, 2015.
