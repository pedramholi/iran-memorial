    News of the execution of Mr. Milad Z., along with another individual, was
    published on the website of the Central Provincial Courthouse on January
    25, 2015. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information about Mr.
    Milad Z. s arrest and detention. Trial Branch Two of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Arak tried Mr. Milad Z. No information is available
    on his trial. Charges According to the report, the charges against Mr.
    Milad Z. were announced as "transportation and possession of narcotics."
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Milad Z. was possession of 2 kilograms and 950 grams of heroin
    and having a criminal record. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Milad Z.'s defense. Judgment Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Arak condemned Mr. Milad Z. to death and the General Public Prosecutor
    s Office and the Head of the Judiciary confirmed the ruling. He was hanged
    at the Arak Central Prison yard on January 25, 2015 at dawn.
