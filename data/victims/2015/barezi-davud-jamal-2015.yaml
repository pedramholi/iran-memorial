    News of the execution of Mr. Davud Jamal Barezi, along with another
    person, was published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News
    Agency) on February 28, 2015. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    Mr. Jamal Barezi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Jamal Barezi s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Jamal Barezi was announced as related to narcotics. No
    information is available on the details of this charge. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Jamal Barezi.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Jamal Barezi s defense.
    Judgment Mr. Davud Jamal Barezi was hanged, along with another person, in
    Jiroft Prison on February 26, 2015. There is no information on the details
    of this execution.
