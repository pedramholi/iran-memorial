    News of the execution of an unknown individual was announced by the local
    Darab Online website on March 2, 2015. The case of this unknown individual
    pertains to sexual crimes. Arrest and detention This unknown individual
    was arrested by the police in the winter of 2012, and spent two years in
    prison. However, there is no information available on the details of this
    unknown individual s arrest and detention. Trial There is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of this unknown
    individual s trial. Charges The court charged this unknown individual with
    rape. He was accused of breaking into the house of a man and raping the
    man s wife in his absence while their little child was present. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence of guilt entered against this unknown
    individual. Defense There is no information available on the details of
    this unknown individual s defense. Judgment The court sentenced this
    unknown man to public execution. The verdict was validated by the Supreme
    Court. After the verdict had been endorsed by the head of the Judiciary,
    this unknown individual was hanged publicly, in the area of the Silo
    Building, in the city of Darab in Fars Province on March 02, 2015.
