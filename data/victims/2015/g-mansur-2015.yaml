    News of the execution of Mr. Mansur G., along with three others, was
    published on the website of the Markazi Provincial Courthouse on May 13,
    2015. According to this source, these executions took place to combat drug
    traffickers. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Mansur G. s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch One of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Arak tried Mr. Mansur G. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges According to the Markazi Provincial
    Courthouse, the charges brought against Mr. Mansur G, were announced as
    selling 89 grams and 30 centigrams of heroin and possession of 441 grams
    and 6 centigrams of heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Mansur G. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mansur G. s defense. Judgment Branch One of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Arak condemned Mr. Mansur G. to death, the Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling and the Head of Judiciary validated it. He was
    hanged, along with three others, at the Arak Central Prison yard on May
    12, 2015.
