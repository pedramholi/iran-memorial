    News of the execution of Mr. Rahim Soleimani, along with four others, was
    published on the websites of Kurdpa and Mafnews on February 16, 2015. Mr.
    Soleimani, son of Zobeid, was a Kurd from the Hursin Village near Orumieh
    in the Azarbaijan-e Gharbi province. (Mafnews) Arrest and detention Mr.
    Soleimani was detained for 20 years (Kurdpa). The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Soleimani s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Soleimani
    was announced as drug trafficking (Kurdpa). No specific information is
    available on his charge. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Soleimani. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Soleimani s defense. Judgment Mr. Rahim
    Soleimani was hanged in the Orumieh Central Prison on February 16, 2015 at
    dawn. No specific information is available about this execution.
