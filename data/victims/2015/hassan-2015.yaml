    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan was published in the Khorasan
    newspaper on February 4, 2015. Arrest and Detention On January 7, 1996,
    the bodies of a mother and her daughter were found at their house. They
    were trustees and kept the valuables for the residents of the Moghan
    Village. In March of 1997, police identified and arrested three
    individuals including Mr. Hassan in separate operations. These individuals
    had come to the village by a car on the night of the incident. Trial
    Branch One of the Chenaran Courthouse tried this case. No further
    information is available on Mr. Hassan s trial. Charges The charge against
    Mr. Hassan was announced as "murder." According to the Khorasan newspaper
    report, these three individuals went to the victims house to rob the
    valuables; however, when they woke up and recognized the defendants, they
    killed them both and escaped. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Hassan was his confession and the confessions of his
    collaborators. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Hassan's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Hassan to death.
    According to the Khorasan newspaper published on February 4, 2015, he was
    hanged in the Mashhad Prison several days earlier. The exact date of this
    execution is unknown.
