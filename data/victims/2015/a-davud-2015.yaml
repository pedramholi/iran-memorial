    News of the execution of Mr. Davud A., along with four others, was
    published on the website of the Central Provincial Courthouse on January
    14, 2015. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on Mr.
    Davud A. s arrest and detention. Trial Branch Two of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Arak tried Mr. Davud A. No information is available
    on his trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Davud A. were announced as
    "possession of 3 kilograms and 330 grams of heroin, two grams of extracted
    heroin, and having a criminal record." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Davud A.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Davud A.'s defense. Judgment
    The court condemned Mr. Davud A. to death and the General Public
    Prosecutor s Office confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in the Arak
    Central Prison on January 13, 2015.
