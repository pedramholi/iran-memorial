    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Mirdust, son of Shahbakhsh, along
    with 10 others, was published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights
    Activists News Agency) on February 22, 2015. According to this report, 21
    individuals were executed in Shiraz, Bam, and Bandar-e Abbas over 48
    hours. Only 11 out of these individuals were identified. Official media
    did not publish names of these executed individuals. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on Mr. Mirdust s arrest and detention.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Mirdust s trial. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Mirdust was announced as "related to narcotics." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Mirdust. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Mirdust's defense. Judgment Mr. Hossein Mirdust was hanged at the Bam
    Central Prison between February 21 and 22, 2015. No specific information
    is available about this execution.
