    News of the execution of Mr. Siamak Ranjbari, along with three other
    unknown individuals, was published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights
    Activists News Agency) on April 15, 2015. The official media in Iran did
    not report these executions. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Ranjbari s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Ranjbari s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr.
    Ranjbari was announced as related to narcotics. No information is
    available on the details of this charge. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Ranjbari. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Ranjbari s defense. Judgment Mr. Siamak
    Ranjbari was hanged in Esfahan Prison on April 13, 2015. There is no
