    News of the execution of Mr. Asghar Sha bani, along with five others, was
    published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on
    February 15, 2015. According to HRANA, the official media did not report
    any of these executions. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on Mr. Sha bani s arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on Mr. Sha bani s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Sha
    bani was announced as "related to narcotics." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Sha bani. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Sha bani s defense. Judgment Mr. Asghar
    Sha bani was transferred to solitary confinement on February 14, and was
    hanged at the Shahab Prison in Kerman on February 15, 2015. No specific
    information is available about this execution.
