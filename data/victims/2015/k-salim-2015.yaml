    News of the execution of Mr. Salim K., along with two others, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on May 28, 2015, Fars news agency on May
    27, 2015, the Khorasan newspaper on May 28, 2015, and the Reporters Club
    on May 27, 2015. Additional information was taken from the Khorasan
    newspaper and the website of the Khorasan-e Razavi General Courthouse on
    May 26, 2015. Mr. Salim K., a resident of Mashhad, was a wiring worker.
    His case and the cases of two other defendants were related to several
    carjacking and robberies from jewelry stores between 2004 and 2011. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Salim K. was arrested by inspectors of the Intelligence
    Police in Khorasan-e Razavi in Mashhad in the fall of 2011. According to
    the police commander in Mashhad, he was identified and arrested during a
    coordinated operation among various divisions of police (Iran newspaper on
    May 28, 2015). The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial Branch Eight of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Mashhad
    tried Mr. Salim K. and the other two defendants in the presence of their
    attorneys and in several sessions (Khorasan-e Razavi General Courthouse).
    No information is available on his trial. Charges According to the
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of Mashhad, the charges brought against
    Mr. Salim K. and the other two defendants were collectively announced as
    Moharebe [fighting against God] by committing armed robberies resulting in
    murder, creating public insecurity, and public fear and intimidation.
    (Khorasan-e Razavi General Courthouse) The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Salim K. was several combat rifles, some
    handmade explosive belts, and explosives, in addition to the defendants
    confessions. According to the Police Commander in Mashhad, the defendants
    confessed to committing 12 armed robberies from jewelry stores in Mashhad
    and a robbery from a financial institution during interrogation. (Iran
    newspaper, May 28, 2015) International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Salim K. s defense. However, his attorney objected the ruling.
    Judgment Branch Eight of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Mashhad
    identified Mr. Salim K. as Mohareb [fighter against God] and condemned him
    to death. Branch 42 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and the Head
    of Judiciary validated it. He was hanged, along with two others, in public
    and in the presence of the Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of Mashhad,
    Police Commander in Mashhad, and the victims families at Moslem Street in
    the Gase-Sharqi quarter in Mashhad on May 27, 2015.
