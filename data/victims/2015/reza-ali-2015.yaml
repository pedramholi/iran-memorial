    as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Ali
    Reza was his confession and the recovery of the victim s body from a water
    canal. In his confession, he confirmed that the victim and he had a
    financial dispute and he had invited the victim to his house when his
    family members were not present on the night of the incident. Their
    dispute turned into fight and, out of anger, he hit the victim on his head
    with a hammer resulting in his unconsciousness. Then he took the victim to
    the Bidestan wilderness around Qazvin, and hit him again with a rock and
    threw his body in the water canal. Following this confession, officials
    found the body in the water canal and transferred it to the forensics
    office. (website of Jamejam) International human rights organizations have
