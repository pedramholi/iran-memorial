    Ms. Salbehi had married the victim under pressure from her family. She was
    only 17 years old at the time of the murder News of Ms. Fatemeh Salbehi s
    execution was published by several media including Sharq newspaper
    (October 14, 2015), HRANA News Agency (October 13, 2015), and Amnesty
    International (October 14, 2015). Additional information was obtained
    through research conducted by the Boroumand Foundation and from the
    Foundation s interview with a person with knowledge of the case, reporting
    from Sharq newspaper (May 14, 2014), and other sources. Ms. Seyedeh
    Fatemeh Salbehi, child of Seyed Ehsan, was born on November 8, 1991, in
    Neyriz village in Abadeh Tashk, Fars Province, and resided in Shiraz. Her
    family forced her to marry at the age of 15, and she divorced her first
    husband after a short while because of his violent and suspicious nature.
    After the divorce, at her family s insistence and to escape social stigma,
    she had to marry one of her relatives who was an employee of the Shiraz
    Judiciary s Dispute Resolution Council. At the time of the incident she
    had not yet started living with her husband and was still a high school
    student. Ms. Salbehi had some problems with her husband, but they had been
    reconciled by the day of the incident and Salbehi had gone to her husband
    s home to eat food they had purchased. Ms. Salbehi s husband had
    previously been the person in charge of Shahid Dastgheib Mosque s cultural
    office, located in Shiraz Valiasr Street, and still lived in a room on the
    second floor of the Mosque that the Basij had put at his disposal. Ms.
    Salbehi s case is related to her husband s murder (Documents available at
    the Boroumand Foundation). Arrest and detention Ms. Fatemeh Salbehi was
    arrested on April 20, 2009, by Shiraz Valiasr Police Precinct officers.

    information, the police became suspicious of the Defendant [Ms. Salbehi],
    who was with her husband on the night of the event, after his body was
    discovered at his place of residence. Ms. Salbehi had spent the night at
    that location, had skipped school the next day. and had gone to the
    library to study. Following a call from the school, her parents went to
    her husband s place to obtain news of their daughter. There they became
    aware of his death. There is no information about the manner of Ms.
    Salbehi s arrest. She was taken to Shiraz Criminal Investigations Bureau
    after the arrest. The Shiraz General and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office
    opened a case against Ms. Salbehi. She admitted to her husband s murder
    under the pressure of interrogations at the Criminal Investigations Bureau
    as well as during investigations at the Prosecutor s Office. Based on
    available information, Ms. Salbehi stated during interrogations that she
    had been forced to get married by her family, that she had problems with
    her husband, and that she had decided to kill him because of the hatred
    she felt for him. She stated during interrogations that, with prior
    intent, she had given him sleep medication and had injected him with air,
    and had then strangled him with a laptop wire. With the information Ms.
    Salbehi provided them, the Police found the objects used to commit the
    crime in a garbage bin near the crime scene. Based on available
    documentation, Ms. Salbehi explained the way the murder was committed
