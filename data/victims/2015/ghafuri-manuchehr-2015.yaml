    News of the execution of Mr. Manuchehr Ghafuri was announced by the
    website of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Hormozgan Province
    (October 12, 2015) as well as HRANA (April 14, 2015). This case pertains
    to the murder of a person in 2011. Arrest and detention There is no
    information available on the details of Mr. Ghafuri s arrest and
    detention. Trial Mr. Ghafuri was tried by Branch One of the Public Court
    of Hormozgan Province. However, there is no information available on the
    details of the session or sessions of his trial. Charges The court charged
    Mr. Ghafuri with murder. He was accused of murdering a person with a
    premeditated plan. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on the details of the evidence of guilt
    entered against Mr. Ghafuri. Defense There is no information available on
    the details of Mr. Ghafuri s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr.
    Manuchehr Ghafuri to death. The verdict was validated by Branch 24 of the
    Supreme Court. After the head of the Judiciary had confirmed the verdict,
    Mr. Gafuri was hanged in the courtyard of Bandar Abbas Central Prison on
    the morning of Thursday, April 9, 2015.
