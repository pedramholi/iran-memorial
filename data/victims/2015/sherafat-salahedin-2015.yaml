    News of the execution of Mr. Salahedin Sherafat was published on the
    websites of Kurdpa on March 12, 2015 and the Campaign to Defend Civil and
    Political Prisoners in Iran on March 11, 2015. He was a Kurd from
    Oshnavieh in Azarbaijan-e Gharbi. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Sherafat s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on Mr. Sherafat s trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Sherafat was murder. No detailed information is available on his
    charge. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against Mr. Sherafat. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Sherafat s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Salahedin Sherafat to
    death. He was hanged at the Orumieh Central Prison on March 11, 2015 at
    dawn. No specific information is available about this execution.
