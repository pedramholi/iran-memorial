    News of the execution of Mr. Samad Mohammadi was published on the websites
    of Kurdpa on March 12, 2015 and the Campaign to Defend Civil and Political
    Prisoners in Iran on March 11, 2015. He was a Kurd from Naqadeh. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of Mr. Mohammadi s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Mohammadi s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Mohammadi was murder. No detailed
    information is available on his charge. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Mohammadi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohammadi s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Samad Mohammadi to death. He was hanged
    at the Orumieh Central Prison on March 11, 2015 at dawn. No specific
    information is available about this execution.
