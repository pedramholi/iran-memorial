    News of the execution of Mr. Karim Rabanipur, along with two others, was
    based on a research performed by the Boroumand Foundation on January 26,
    2015. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on Mr.
    Rabanipur s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Rabanipur s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Rabanipur was announced
    as "related to narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Rabanipur. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Rabanipur's defense. Judgment Mr. Karim Rabanipur was
    hanged at the Karaj Central Prison on January 25, 2015. No specific
    information is available about this execution.
