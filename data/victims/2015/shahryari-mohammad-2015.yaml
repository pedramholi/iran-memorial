    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Shahryari, along with two others,
    was published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency)
    on January 25, 2015. Additionally, the news of this execution and five
    others was published on the website of the Iran Human Rights Organization
    on January 26, 2015. News of this execution was not reflected in the
    official media in Kerman province. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on Mr. Shahryari s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Shahryari s trial. Charges According to
    the Iran Human Rights Organization report, the charge against Mr.
    Shahryari was announced as "related to narcotics." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Shahryari.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Shahryari's defense. Judgment
    Mr. Mohammad Shahryari was hanged at the Shahab Prison yard in Kerman on
    January 25, 2015. Before the execution the families were informed and had
    a chance for their last visitations.
