    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Nuri, along with another
    individual*, was announced by HRANA news agency as well as the website of
    the Human Rights Activists for Democracy in Iran on April 11, 2015. Mr.
    Nuri, 25, was from the Herat Province of Afghanistan. His case pertains to
    crimes connected to illegal drugs. Arrest and detention Mr. Nuri was
    imprisoned in Ward 6 of Zahedan Central Prison. However, there is no
    information available on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial
    There is no information available on the details of the session or
    sessions of Mr. Nuri s trial. Charges Mr. Nuri was charged with storing
    illegal drugs. However, there is no information available on the details
    of the charges brought against him. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt There is no information available on the details of the evidence of
    guilt entered against Mr. Nuri. Defense There is no information available
    on the details of Mr. Nuri s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr.
    Mohammad Nuri to death. He was moved to solitary confinement on the eve of
    the execution. Mr. Nuri was hanged in Zahedan Central Prison on April 11,
    2015. --------------------------- * Mr. Hatef Barahu'i
