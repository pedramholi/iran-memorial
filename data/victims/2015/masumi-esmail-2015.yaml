    News of the execution of Mr. Esma il Ma sumi was published on the website

    According to HRANA, the official media of the Islamic Republic did not yet

    sumi was detained at the Adelabad Prison in Shiraz for four years. There
    is no specific information on his arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Ma sumi s trial. Charges The charge
    against Mr. Ma sumi was announced as "related to narcotics." The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Ma sumi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ma sumi s
    defense. Judgment Mr. Esma il Ma sumi was hanged at the Adelabad Prison in
    Shiraz on February 5, 2015. No specific information is available about
    this execution.
