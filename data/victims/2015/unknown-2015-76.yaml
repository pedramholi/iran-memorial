    News of the execution of an unknown man along with nine others was
    announced by the website of HRANA on March 3, 2015. The case of this
    defendant pertains to crimes connected to illegal drugs. Arrest and
    detention There is no information available on the details of this unknown
    individual s arrest and detention. Trial There is no information available
    on the details of the session or sessions of this unknown individual s
    trial. Charges The charge of this defendant pertains to crimes connected
    to illegal drugs. However, there is no information available on the
    details of this charge. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt There is no information available on the details of the evidence of
    guilt entered against this unknown individual. Defense There is no
    information available on the details of this unknown individual s defense.
    Judgment The court sentenced this unknown man to death. This unknown
    individual was hanged along with nine others in the courtyard of Shiraz s
    Adelabad Prison on the morning of March 3, 2015. There is no further
    information available on the details of this verdict.
