    News of the execution of Mr. Ali, known as Ali Pasdar, along with three
    other individuals, was announced by the website of Campaign for Defense of
    Civil Political Prisoners (March 11, 2015) as well as Kurdpa news agency
    (March 12, 2015). This case pertains to murder. Arrest and detention There
    is no information available on the details of Mr. Ali s arrest and
    detention. Trial There is no information available on the details of the
    session or sessions of Mr. Ali s trial. Charges The court charged Mr. Ali
    with murder. However, there is no information available on the details of
    the charges brought against him. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on the details of the evidence of guilt
    entered against Mr. Ali. Defense There is no information available on the
    details of Mr. Ali s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Ali to
    death. He was hanged, along with two other individuals, in Orumieh Central
    Prison on March 11, 2015. There is no further information available on
    this verdict.
