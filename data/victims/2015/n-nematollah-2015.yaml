    News of the execution of Mr. Nematollah N., along with three other
    individuals*, was announced by the website of the provincial Ministry of
    Justice office of the Markazi Province on April 12, 2015. His case
    pertains to crimes connected to illegal drugs. Arrest and detention There
    is no information available on the details of Mr. Nematollah N. s arrest
    and detention. Trial According to the available information, Mr.
    Nematollah N. was tried by Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Arak. However, there is no information available on the details of the
    session or sessions of his trial. Charges The court charged Mr. Nematollah
    N. with participating in carrying and storing 6 kilograms and 950 grams of
    heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on details of the evidence of guilt
    entered against Mr. Nematollah N. Defense There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Nematollah N. s defense. Judgment The
    court sentenced Mr. Nematollah N. to death. The issued verdict was
    validated by the Supreme Court, and later enforced by the head of the
    Judiciary. Mr. Nematollah N. was hanged in Arak Central Prison on April
    12, 2015. -------------------------- *Messers: Hamed N., Mohammad L. and
