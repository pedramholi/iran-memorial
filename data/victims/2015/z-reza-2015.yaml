    News of the execution of Mr. Reza Z., along with three others, was
    published on the website of Central Provincial Courthouse on February 22,
    2015. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information about Mr. Reza
    Z. s arrest and detention. Trial Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Arak tried Mr. Reza Z. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges According to the report, the charges against Mr. Reza Z. were
    announced as "participation in transportation and possession of
    narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Reza Z. was transportation and possession of 972 grams of
    heroin. Defense No information is available on Mr. Reza Z.'s defense.
    Judgment Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Arak condemned
    Mr. Reza Z. to death and the General Public Prosecutor s Office and the
    Head of the Judiciary confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at the Arak
    Central Prison yard on February 22, 2015 at dawn.
