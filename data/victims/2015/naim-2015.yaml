    News of the execution of Mr. Na im (without a last name), along with four
    others, was published on the websites of Jam-e Jam on April 16, 2015,
    Javanonline on April 17, 2015, and the Iran Human Rights Organization on
    May 3, 2015. According to the existing information, he was married and an
    Afghan citizen. His case was related to the murder of his wife in Varamin
    on May 5, 2011. Arrest and detention The Varamin police arrested Mr. Na
    im. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Branch 71 of the Tehran Criminal Court tried Mr. Na im. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Na im was
    announced as murdering his wife. (Jam-e Jam and Javanonline) The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Na im was his confession. During his trial, he stated that his wife,
    huffing in anger, went to her father s house on the day of the incident.
    He could not make her come back. Therefore, he became angry and attacked
    his wife and her family. (Jam-e Jam and Javanonline) International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Na im s defense. Judgment Branch 71 of
    the Tehran Criminal Court condemned Mr. Na im to death and Branch 27 of
    the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along with four
    others, at the Gohardasht Prison yard in Karaj on April 16, 2015.
