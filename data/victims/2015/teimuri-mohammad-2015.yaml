    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Teymuri, on July 29, 2015, was reported by
    Farat News website. Mr. Mohammad Teymuri, son of Pulad, was born in 1970,
    and had two children. His case was related to a murder. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Teymuri was arrested in 1989. He spent five years in the
    Tabriz Central Prison. The circumstances of Mr. Teymuri s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on this
    defendant s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr.Teymuri was
    murder in the first degree , but there are no details on the charges
    brought against him. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence providedagainst the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Teymuri s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr.
    Mohammad Teymuri to death by hanging (retaliation for taking a life). He
    went to the gallows in April of 2015, but was taken back to prison on a
    three month reprieve from the prosecutor s office, pending the acceptance
    of a clemency plea from the family of the victim. In this interval, he was
    not able to obtain the clemency of the family of the victim. Mr. Teymuri
    was taken from his cell, at 7:30 am, on July 29, 2015. At 9 a.m. the same
    day, he was executed in Tabriz Prison.
