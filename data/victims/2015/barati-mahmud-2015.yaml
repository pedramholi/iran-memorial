    News of the execution of Mr. Mahmud Barati, along with several others, was
    published on the websites of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency)
    and the Iran Human Rights Organization on September 7, 2015. Additional
    information was taken from the Amnesty International statement on
    September 7, 2015 and the website of Iran Human Rights Organization on
    September 9, 2015. Mr. Barati was a teacher in Tayyebat who also worked as
    a part time taxi driver. His only son was 3 years old when he was arrested
    and, 12 years old when he was executed. His brother, Ahmad Barati, was on
    the death row at Fashfuyeh Prison in Tehran at the time. In a statement
    published several hours before his execution, Amnesty International called
    Mr. Barati s proceedings unfair and demanded a stop on his execution.
    According to the existing information, in the summer of 2006, Ahmad
    Barati, Mr. Barati s brother, was arrested in Robat-Karim, Tehran, and
    condemned to death for transportation and possession of half a kilogram of
    crack. Mr. Barati went to Tehran, along with his mother and his sister,
    hoping to prevent the execution of his brother. Since the recovered
    narcotics did not belong to his brother and a friend gave them to him to
    sell, Mr. Barati pressured the narcotics owner to save his brother. This
    was going on for several months before the narcotics owner was arrested
    for possession of 5.5 kilograms of crack. Imagining that Mr. Barati was
    responsible for his arrest, the narcotics owner claimed that he had
    purchased the recovered narcotics from Mr. Barati and his mother and his
    sister to revenge them. Therefore, the warrant for arresting Mr. Barati
    was issued. (Iran Human Rights Organization, quoting a Barati family
    member) Arrest and detention Mr. Barati was arrested, along with his
    mother and his sister, in the summer of 2006. According to the Amnesty
    International report, quoting a source at Qezelhesar Prison, Mr. Barati
    was tortured for ten days at the Drug Control Headquarters to confess
    against himself. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Robat-Karim
    tried Mr. Barati (Iran Human Rights Organization). No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Barati was
    announced as selling 5.5 kilograms of crack. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the existing information, the
    evidence presented against Mr. Barati was his confession and the
    confession of the person who was arrested for possession of narcotics.
    This person told the court that he had purchased the narcotics from Mr.
    Barati and his mother and his sister. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense After his
    interrogation was over, Mr. Barati revoked his confession regarding the
    possession of narcotics in the presence of the Public Prosecutor, and
    during his trial (Amnesty International). He stated that he was coerced to
    confess due to harassment and with a promise made by his interrogator to
    release his family. His interrogator told him in order to close the case
    he could accept the charge and then deny it in his trial so his mother and
    his sister would be released. But the court did not pay any attention to
    his statement. The only other evidence against Mr. Barati was the
    confession of the person who was arrested with the narcotics. In a letter
    to the court, this person indicated that his confession was not right and
    Mahmud Barati was not the owner of the recovered narcotics. He had made up
    such confession to avenge him. But the court did not pay attention to this
    letter. Before being executed in 2011, this person wrote another letter
    indicating that he did not purchase the recovered narcotics from Mahmud
    Barati. The real owner of narcotics was executed that day and the
    execution of Mr. Barati was postponed for further investigation. The p
