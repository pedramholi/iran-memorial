    News of the execution of Mr. Ra uf Hassani, son of Hassan, along with
    seven others, was published on the Kurdistan Human Rights Network on
    September 22, 2015. He was from Baneh and his case was related to a
    murder. Arrest and detention Mr. Hassani was detained for 13 years. He was
    transferred from Salamat [Health] Section to Quarantine Section of the
    prison on September 15, 2015. The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Hassani
    s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Hassani was announced as
    murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against Mr. Hassani. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Hassani s defense. Judgment Mr. Ra uf Hassani was executed at the Sanandaj
    Central Prison on September 16, 2015. No specific information is available
    about this execution.
