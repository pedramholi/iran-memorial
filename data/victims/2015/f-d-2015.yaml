    News of the execution of Mr. D. F., son of Sha ban ali, along with two
    others, was published on the websites of Gilan General Courthouse on March
    1, 2015, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Gilan General
    Courthouse, and Jamejam Online on March 2, 2015. Mr. D. F. was from Gilan.
    He had been arrested previously for drug trafficking and imprisoned. The
    court first condemned him to death but when he repented and requested
    pardon, his request was accepted and his sentence was reduced to life
    imprisonment. Arrest and detention According to the Jamejam Online, Mr. D.
    F. took a leave from prison after awhile. When he tried to smuggle
    narcotics into the prison after his leave, he was arrested again. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial The
    Criminal Court of Gilan tried Mr. D. F. No information is available on his
    trial. Charges According to the Public Relations Office of the Gilan
    General Courthouse, the charges against Mr. D. F. were announced as
    transportation and possession of narcotics. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence provided against Mr. D. F. was having a
    criminal record for nine convictions and hiding narcotics in his sandals
    to smuggle it into the prison. (Jamejam Online) Defense No information is
    available on Mr. D. F. s defense. Judgment The Criminal Court of Gilan
    condemned Mr. D. F. to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling.
    He was hanged in the presence of authorities at the Rasht Prison yard on
    Saturday February 28, 2015. His body was transferred to the morgue.
