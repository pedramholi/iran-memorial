    News of the execution of Mr. S. Q., son of Abbas, born in Kermanshah,
    along with three others, was published on the website of the Gilan
    Provincial Courthouse, quoting the Public Relations Office of this
    courthouse on January 31, 2015. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on Mr. S. Q. s arrest and detention. Trial Mr. S. Q. was tried
    in Rasht. No further information is available on his trial. Charges
    According to the Public Relations Office of the Gilan Provincial
    Courthouse, the charges against Mr. S. Q. were announced as
    "transportation and possession of 5 kilograms and 750 grams of heroin."
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. S. Q. Defense No information is available on Mr. S.
    Q.'s defense. Judgment A court in Rasht condemned Mr. S. Q. to death. The
    Supreme Court and the Head of the Judiciary confirmed the ruling. Twice
    the Amnesty and Pardon Commission denied the defendant s pardon request.
    The ruling was carried out in the presence of officials when he was hanged
    in the Rasht Central Prison on January 31, 2015. His body was transferred
    to the morgue to be given to his relatives.
