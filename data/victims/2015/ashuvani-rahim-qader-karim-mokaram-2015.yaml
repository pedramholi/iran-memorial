    News of the execution of Mr. Rahim Karim Mokaram, known as Qader Ashovani,
    along with seven others, was published on the official website of the
    Qazvin Provincial Courthouse and, separately, on the Kurdpa website on
    December 24, 2015. Mr. Karim Mokaram, 46, was a Kurd from the Hassanabad
    Village, Nalus District, near Oshnavieh in Azarbaijan-e Gharbi. He had
    been previously imprisoned for 11 years in Tehran in relation to narcotics
    charges. (Kurdpa) Arrest and detention According to the Public Prosecutor
    of Qazvin, Mr. Karim Mokaram was arrested, along with seven other
    defendants of this case, during two operations in 2011. Their case was
    sent to Branch Six of the Public Prosecutor s Office of Qazvin (Qazvin
    Provincial Courthouse). The circumstances of his arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial Branch Three of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qazvin
    tried Mr. Karim Mokaram. No information is available on his trial. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Karim Mokaram was announced as drug
    trafficking. No specific information is available on his charge. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the Public
    Prosecutor of Qazvin, two defendants of this case had been arrested while
    possessing 10 kilograms and 900 grams of heroin. They claimed that Mr.
    Karim Mokaram gave them the narcotics on a highway in order to deliver it
    to another defendant of the case. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Karim Mokaram s defense. Judgment Branch Three of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Qazvin condemned Mr. Rahim Karim Mokaram and six
    other defendants of this case to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged, along with seven others, at the Qazvin Prison yard
    on December 24, 2015 at dawn.
