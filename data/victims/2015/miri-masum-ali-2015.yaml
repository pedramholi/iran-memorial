    News of the execution of Mr. Ma sum Ali Miri, along with ten others, was
    published on the website of the Iran Human Rights Organization on April
    16, 2015. According to this report, over 42 individuals were executed in
    Iran s prisons during three days and the judicial authorities announced
    the names of only 8 individuals. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    Mr. Miri s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Miri s trial. Charges According to the Iran Human Rights
    Organization, the charge brought against Mr. Miri was announced as related
    to narcotics. He and other executed prisoners in Qezelhesar were narcotics
    defendants in Shahriyar. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Miri. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Miri s defense. Judgment Mr. Ma sum Ali Miri was hanged,
    along with ten others, at the Qezelhesar Prison in Karaj on April 14,
    2015.
