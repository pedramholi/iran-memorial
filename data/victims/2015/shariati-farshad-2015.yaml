    News of the execution of Mr. Farshad Shariati along with two other persons
    was announced by the website of the Campaign for Defense of Civil
    Political Prisoners on January 8, 2015. Mr. Shari'ati was from Sanandaj
    and his case was related to drug. Arrest and detention Mr. Shari'ati was
    detained in Sanandaj Prison since 2010. He was taken to a solitary
    confinement on January 08, 2015. There is no further information available
    on the details of Mr. Shariati s arrest and detention. Trial There is no
    information available on the details of the session or sessions of Mr.
    Shariati s trial. Charges Chrges brought against Mr. Shari'ati was "drug
    trafficking". The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    There is no information available on the details of the evidence of guilt
    entered against Mr. Shariati. Defense There is no information available on
    the details of Mr. Shariati s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr.
    Farshad Shariati to death. Mr. Shariati was hanged in Sananda Central
    Prison on January 8, 2015. However, there is no information available on
    the details of this verdict.
