    The execution of Mr. Jamal Jafari, on August 27, 2015, was reported by the
    Kurdistan Human Rights Defenders Center website. Mr. Jafari was an ethnic
    Kurd from Sanandaj. This case was related to murder. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Jafari was held prisoner in the Central Prison of Sanandaj, for four
    years. The circumstances of Mr. Jafari s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on this defendant s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Jafari was murder in the first
    degree . There is no information on the details of this charge. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Jafari. Defense No information is available on Mr. Jafari s defense.
    Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Jamal Jafari to death by hanging
    (retaliation for taking a life). He was taken to the gallows in late July,
    2015, but was able to get a one month reprieve from the parents of the
    victim to file an appeal. During the one month reprieve, the Citizens
    Rights Activists of Sanandaj and Mr. Jafari s relatives tried to obtain
    clemency from the family of the victim, but they did not succeed. On
    August 27, 2015, Mr. Jafari was hung in the main hall of Sanandaj Central
    Prison. The family of the victim were in attendance.
