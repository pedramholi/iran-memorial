    News of the execution of an unknown man, along with 11 others, was
    published on the website of the HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency)
    on May 22, 2015. According to this report, these executions took place on
    May 5, and 19, 2015. The judicial authorities did not announce the
    majority of the executions that were carried out in some secrecy. The
    human rights organizations did not report them. Arrest and detention
    According to HRANA, quoting an informed source, this defendant could be
    one of the prisoners who had been imprisoned at the Qezelhesar Prison for
    between 7 to 12 years. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on this defendant s trial.
    Charges According to HRANA, the charge brought against the defendant was
    announced as related to narcotics. The total amount of narcotics that he
    was charged with was not over 500 grams. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment
    This defendant was hanged, along with 11 others, at the Qezelhesar Prison
    in Karaj on May 5, 2015.
