    Jamshid Dehqani: We were men of religion and the mosque, and in addition
    to daily tasks, we cared about religious issues News of Mr. Jamshid
    Dehqani s execution along with his brother and four other individuals, was
    published by various sources including Kalemeh TV (March 4, 2015), HRANA
    (March 4, 2015), and Deutsche Welle Radio (March 4, 2015). The Judiciary
    Branch news agency (Mizan Online, March 4, 2015) also announced the news
    of the execution of six individuals in Rajai Shahr Prison, without stating
    their names. Additional information was obtained through an interview
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with Mr. Hamed Ahmadi,
    the spokesman for Rajai Shahr Prison Sunni prisoners (ABF Interview) in
    the weeks leading to the execution, prisoners video messages and audio
    interviews with television networks and other media from inside prison,
    including video messages recorded by Mr. Dehqani, and other sources*. Mr.
    Dehqani was single, had a high school diploma, and was a Sunni Kurd
    residing in [the city of] Sanandaj. He was a taxi driver and the oldest
    son of a five-member poor and deprived family. Jamshid and his brother
    Jahangir were the family s breadwinners and guardians, and in charge of
    their old and sick parents. According to his sister, their family had no
    source of income after her brothers arrest, and lived on people s support.
    (Rooz Online) Mr. Dehqani was a religious man and believed and practiced
    the Shafe i [branch of Islam]. He himself had written: We were men of
    religion and the mosque, and in addition to daily tasks, we cared about
    religious issues (Sunni News, September 26, 2013). Among his religious
    activities were participating in Ebrahim Khalilollah Mosque and
    distributing religious CD s and printed materials in his taxi. According
    to his prison mate, he was a patient and pleasant man who tried to help
    people around him and those in need. In prison, he was engaged in
    [spiritual] purification and religious studies. (ABF Interview) Mr.
    Dehqani did not belong to any group or organization. He and the other
    prisoners sentenced to death were proselytizing the Shafe i**religion, and
    according to themselves, were trying to prevent people being taken
    advantage of in the name of religion. (Center for Supporters of Human
    Rights, May 4, 2014) Background Based on existing information, in the
    years 2007 to 2009-10, numerous insults were made by promoters of the Shi
    a religion against Sunni beliefs and individuals who commanded their
    respect, causing the reaction of Sunni religious personalities and
    activists. Following offensive remarks made by Ebrahim Hatamikia (famous
    Shi a film director) against Aisha (the Prophet Mohammad s wife) in an
    interview with Khanevadeh Sabz Magazine (Volume 195, 2007), and statements
    made by well-known preachers including Hojjatoleslam Daneshmand,
    Hojjatoleslam Juybari, and Hojjatoleslam Ansari whose lectures were at
    times covered by state-run radio and television a number of religious
    Sunni youth from Kurdistan considered these insults to have been organized
    [by the state]. They started religious classes, distributing CD s and
    books in local mosques, universities, and their neighborhoods, and
    protested these actions, shedding light on [the motives], promoting and
    defending the principles of the Shafe i religion. These CD s included
    documented cases offensive to Sunni beliefs, quoting religious
    authoritative and reputable sources such as Bihar al-Anwar. These young
    people s religious activities aroused the security apparatus suspicions.
    Subsequent to Ayatollah Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj in May 2009, a number
    of young Sunni Kurd religious activists were arrested in the name of the
    fight against Salafi and heretic movements. Three months after these
    arrests, [a number of] assassinations were carried out in Sanandaj,
    including those of Mamusta Shiekholeslam, member of the Assembly of
    Experts, and Molla Borjhan Aali, a Sunni cleric. The security forces
    accused individuals that had already been arrested prior theses
    assassinations. Although the charge of assassination was not brought up in
    court and the arrestees were tried for Moharebeh, the charge was,
    nevertheless, constantly mentioned on news media and by judicial and
    security officials. The defendants denied any and all relations with
    armed, radical, and extremist groups, objected to the charges brought
    against them and demanded an open re-trial, to which they got no response.
    Ultimately, six of the detainees were executed in January 2013 and another
    six on March 4, 2015. The issuance and implementation of the death
    sentence against this group of Sunni defendants caused much reaction by
    individuals and domestic and international institutions. In June 2014, 19
    human rights organizations objected to the sentences and demanded that
    they be revoked. Additionally, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch,
    the Center for Human Rights Defenders, and the Abdorrahman Boroumand
