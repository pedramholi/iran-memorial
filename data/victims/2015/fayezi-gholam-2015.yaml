    News of the execution of Mr. Gholam Fayezi, along with nine others not
    named, was published on the website of the Hormozgan General Courthouse,
    quoting the Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan General Courthouse,
    and on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) with full
    names on August 17, 2015. Mr. Fayezi was from Tabriz. Arrest and detention
    According to HRANA, Mr. Fayezi was detained for four years; however, the
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial According
    to the website of the Hormozgan General Courthouse, Branch Two of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Bandar-e Abbas tried Mr. Fayezi. However,
    no information is available on his trial. Charges According to the Public
    Relations Office of the Hormozgan General Courthouse, the charge brought
    against Mr. Fayezi was announced as drug trafficking. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Fayezi.
    However, according to the Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan General
    Courthouse, these ten executed drug traffickers in Minab and Bandar-e
    Abbas had been charged with possession, transportation, and selling over
    398 kilograms of narcotics including 70 kilograms of heroin, 200 kilograms
    of opium, 105 kilograms of crack, 4 kilograms of hashish, and 19 grams of
    morphine across the Hormozgan Province and the neighboring provinces.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Fayezi s defense. Judgment
    Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Bandar-e Abbas condemned
    Mr. Gholam Fayezi to death. After the General Public Prosecutor confirmed
    the ruling, it was carried out on Monday August 17, 2015 and Mr. Fayezi
    was hanged, along with five others, at the Bandar-e Abbas Central Prison
    yard at six a. m.
