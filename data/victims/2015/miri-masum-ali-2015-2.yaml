    News of the execution of Mr. Masum Ali Miri, along with at least 42 other
    individuals, was announced by the website of Iran Human Rights on April
    16, 2015. This pertains to crimes connected to illegal drugs. Arrest and
    detention There is no information available on the details of Mr. Ali Miri
    s arrest and detention. Trial There is no information available on the
    details of the session or sessions of Mr. Ali Miri s trial. Charges
    According to available information, the court charged Mr. Ali Miri with
    crimes connected to illegal drugs. However, there is no information
    available on the details of the charges brought against Mr. Ali Miri. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    available on the details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr. Ali
    Miri. Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr. Ali
    Miri s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Masum Ali Miri to death.
    He was hanged, along with 10 other defendants, in Karaj s Ghezel Hesar
    Prison on April 14, 2015.
