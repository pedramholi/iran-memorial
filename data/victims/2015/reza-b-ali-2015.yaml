    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Reza B., along with three others, was
    published on the website of the Markazi Provincial Courthouse on May 19,
    2015. According to this source, these executions took place to combat drug
    traffickers. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Ali Reza B. s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch One of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Delijan tried Mr. Ali Reza B. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges According to the Markazi Provincial
    Courthouse, the charge brought against Mr. Ali Reza B, was announced as
    participation in transferring 111 kilograms of heroin. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Ali Reza B.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Ali Reza B. s defense. Judgment
    Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Delijan condemned Mr. Ali
    Reza B. to death, the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and the Head of
    Judiciary validated. He was hanged, along with three others, at the Arak
    Central Prison yard on May 19, 2015.
