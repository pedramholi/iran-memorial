    News of the execution of Mr. Tarverdi Tarverdizadeh, along with nine
    others, was published on the website of Nafasdarqafas on January 23, 2015.
    Arrest and Detention Mr. Tarverdizadeh was detained at Section 4 of the
    Orumieh Prison. There is no specific information on his arrest and
    detention. Trial No information is available on Mr. Tarverdizadeh s trial.
    Charges The charge against Mr. Tarverdizadeh was announced as "drug
    trafficking." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Tarverdizadeh. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Tarverdizadeh s defense. Judgment Mr. Tarverdi Tarverdizadeh was
    hanged at Orumieh Central Prison on January 21, 2015. No specific
    information is available about this execution.
