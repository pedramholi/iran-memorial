    News and information regarding the execution of Mr. Siavash Ghiasi, son of
    PanahAli was sent to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center via an electronic form
    on July 06, 2018 by a person who knew him. The news of his execution,
    along with two others, was also published on the websites of ISNA,
    Azarbaijan-e Sharqi Courthouse, and En ekas-e Bonab on January 21, 2015.
    News of his arrest and prosecution was published on the websites of Nasr
    on November 20, Young Reporters Club on October 11, Fars news agency on
    October 6, and Azarbaijan-e Sharqi Courthouse on October 8, 2014. Mr.
    Ghiasi, from Bonab, was married and had a son. Hiscase was related to a
    twelve-year-old girl who was kidnapped on her way back home from school
    after she left her school bus on September 28, 2014. The kidnappers
    contacted the girl s father and demanded 60 billion Rials for her freedom
    within 48 hour; but they never contacted them after the deadline. Arrest
    and Detention Since the kidnappers did not contact again, the security and
    intelligence forces began their investigation and arrested three
    individuals, including Mr. Ghiasi six days later. There is no specific
    information on his arrest and detention except the local
    authorities'announcement that there was no clue on the the kidnappers and
    the close collaboration of the police and agents from the Ministry of
    Information led to the arrest of the defendant and two others (Ene'kas-e
    Bonab). After the arrest, the public prosecutor of Bonab emphasized that
    the judiciary system will "review the case of these kidnappers and punish
    them as soon as possible." (Azarbaijan-e Sharqi Courthouse) Trial Branch
    Two of the Criminal Court of Azarbaijan-e Sharqi tried this case on
    November 6, 2014. During the session, the victim s family demanded the
    maximum penalty and the defendants represented themselves. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Ghiasi were announced as "participation in kidnapping,
    murder, and hiding the victim s body." Evidence of Guilt According to the
    website of Azarbaijan-e Sharqi Courthouse, quoting the Revolutionary
    Public Prosecutor of Bonab, the evidence presented against Mr. Ghiasi was
    his confession and some other evidence and reasons beyond doubt. The
    victim's body was buried in the backyard of one of the defendent's house.
    According to the Azarbaijan-e Sharqi Courthouse, quoting the Revolutionary
    Public Prosecutor of Tabriz, these defendants committed the kidnapping and
    requested ransom because the victim s father was rich. When police were
    informed, they decided to murder the girl for the fear of being arrested.
    According to the website of the Young Reporters Club, one of the
    defendants was related to the victim s family. Defense According to the
    Nasr website, without describing the details of their defense, two
    defendants of this case tried to implicate each other and exonerate
    themselves. A Summary of Legal Defects Mr. Siavash Ghiasi s Legal
    Proceedings No precise information is available on Mr. Ghiasi s case. No
    precise information has been published on how he and two other defendants
    were interrogated, what evidence existed against them, how trial was
    conducted, and whether their rights were observed or not. It seems,
    however, that judicial authorities have rushed into trying and executing
    the defendants. Based on available information, the defendants kidnapped
    the victim in late September 2014 and were arrested a few days later. They
    were tried on November 6 of the same year at the Province Criminal Court,
    the case was quickly sent to the Supreme Court, which upheld the ruling.
    Ultimately, all three defendants were executed on January 21, 2015.
    Therefore, it took only one month to issue a ruling from the time of the
    arrest and preliminary investigations. This time frame for adjudicating a
    kidnapping and murder case involving three individuals in Iranian courts
    is truly cause for reflection. How did judicial authorities interrogate
    the defendants, conduct and complete preliminary investigations, and issue
    a sentence in one month? It takes months to adjudicate much less important
    cases such as dishonored checks and missing alimony payments. Right now,
    there are murder cases in Iran that have remained open for years. What was
    the reason for this case binge adjudicated with such speed? There is a
    strong possibility that the hasty and precipitated adjudication of the
    kidnapping and murder of a 12-year-old girl has adversely affected the
    conduct of a fair trial. Another interesting issue in this case is that
    all three defendants were sentenced to death. In accordance with Iranian
    law, the individual who perpetrates the killing blow is considered the
    murderer. Even though it is possible that murder can be committed jointly,
    it is improbable. In order to find all three guilty of murder, it is
    necessary to prove that all three perpetrated the killing blow to the
    victim or all three jointly perpetrated a single killing blow. In the
    present case, the victim was strangled with a rope. It is the
