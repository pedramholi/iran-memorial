    wife. No detailed information is available on his charge. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.

    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Yusefi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Yusefi s defense.
