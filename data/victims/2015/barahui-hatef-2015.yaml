    News of the execution of Mr. Hatef Barahui was announced by HRANA news
    agency as well as the website of Human Rights Activists for Democracy in
    Iran on April 11, 2015. Mr. Barahui, 35, was a Baluchi citizen. His case
    is related to crimes connected to illegal drugs. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Barahui served a term in Ward 7 of Zahedan Central Prison. There is no
    information available on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial
    There is no information available on the details of the session or
    sessions of Mr. Barahui s trial. Charges The court charged Mr. Barahui
    with storing illegal drugs. However, there is no information available on
    the details of the charges that were brought against Mr. Barahui. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    available on the details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr.
    Barahui. Defense There is no information available on the details of Mr.
    Barahui s defense. Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Hatef Barahui to
    death. He was moved to solitary confinement on the eve of execution. Mr.
    Barahui was hanged in Zahedan Central Prison on April 11, 2015.
