    Mr. Baluchi lived with his family in the underprivileged Koldar Village in
    Hormozgan Province. News of the execution of Mr. Sa id Baluchi was
    published on the website of the Baloch Activists Campaign on March 7,
    2015. Additional information was taken from an interview by Abdorrahman
    Bouroumand Ceter on October 16, 2015 (ABC interview) with a person close
    to him and the website of Baloch Activists Campaign on March 9, 2015. Mr.
    Baluchi, 49, was married and father of five children. He was Sunni and
    lived with his family in the Koldar Village, extremely deprived village
    near Nikshahr.. He had an elementary education. He earned his living by
    transporting goods in the area. Since the residents of the village had no
    means to go to the city to provide for their daily needs, Mr. Baluchi s
    job was to purchase their needed supplies and bring them back to the
    village. (ABC interview) According to the person interviewed by ABC, Mr.
    Baluch was a religious person. When Sunni missionaries went to his
    Village, they stayed at Mr. Baluchi s and his father s house. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Baluchi was arrested by agents of the Public Prosecutor s
    Office in his village on September 28, 2012. According to the interviewee,
    agents had a warrant to arrest a resident of the Koldar Village who had
    smuggled a truck of narcotics eight months earlier and had escaped arrest.
    After several summons and unable to find the escapee, agents arrested Mr.
    Baluchi and transferred him to solitary confinement by the Police
    investigation unit in Nikshahr without offering any reason or having a
    warrant. (ABC interview) According to the interviewee, efforts by Mr.
    Baluchi s family to find out his whereabouts were fruitless. He was
    transferred to the Chahbahar Prison after five days. According to the
    existing information, during this period, he was tortured to such an
    extent that he could not stand or walk and could not recognize his
    children after his transfer to Chahbahar Prison. Marks of torture were
    evident on his body. He only felt better after 3 to 4 months medical
    treatment. (ABC interview) During his monthly visitations at the Chahbahar
    Prison, he told his family that he was tortured in solitary confinement to
    confess that all the narcotics seized in the past eight months belonged to
    him. According to the interviewee, he was given electrical shocks and had
    lost consciousness under torture. Marks of holes on the back of his feet,
    according to him, were torture marks from a drill and nails. (ABC
    interview) Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Nikshahr tried Mr.
    Baluchi in 2 closed sessions on December 2nd and 6th, 2012. According to
    the interviewee, in addition to the judge and the Public Prosecutor of
    Nikshahr, Mr. Naser Kiani Afzali, the public defender, and one of Mr.
    Baluchi s sons were present. According to the existing information, the
    trial session took only 20 minutes. (ABC interview) Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Baluchi was announced as transporting narcotics. He
    was accused of being the driver of a vehicle containing smuggled narcotics
    on the road to Nikshahr, which was discovered eight months before his
    arrest. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the
    interviewee, the evidence presented against Mr. Baluchi was the vehicle
    and discovered goods, papers with his fingerprints, and testimonies by 31
    agents of the Anti-narcotic Force indicating that Mr. Baluchi had been
    arrested while driving the vehicle containing narcotics, was armed with a
    Kalashnikov, and had a confrontation with agents. (ABC interview) Defense
    According to the existing information, Mr. Baluchi was denied the
    opportunity to defend himself. He could not hire an attorney due to
    poverty and, according to the interviewee, his public defender did not
    defend him during the trial and just told him to tell the judge whether
    the goods were his or not. Mr. Baluchi denied the charges and swore that
    they were trumped-up. According to people close to him, when tortured in
    solitary confinement, agents forced Mr. Baluchi to put his fingerprint on
    papers the content of which he didn t know. (ABC interview) Acco
