    News of the execution of an unknown individual along with 14 others was
    announced by the website of HRANA on March 3, 2015. The case of this
    defendant pertains to crimes connected to illegal drugs. Arrest and
    detention This unknown individual served a term in Ghezel Hesar Prison and
    Karaj Central Penitentiary. He/she met with his/her family on the day
    before the execution and then was moved to solitary confinement. However,
    there is no further information available on the details of this unknown
    individual s arrest and detention. Trial There is no information available
    on the details of the session or sessions of this unknown individual s
    trial. Charges The charge of this defendant, along with 14 others,
    pertains to crimes connected to illegal drugs. However, there is no
    information available on the details of his charge. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on the
    details of the evidence of guilt entered against this unknown individual.
    Defense There is no information available on the details of this unknown
    individual s defense. Judgment This unknown individual was hanged along
    with 14 others in the courtyard of Karaj s Ghezel Hesar Prison on the
    morning of March 3, 2015.
