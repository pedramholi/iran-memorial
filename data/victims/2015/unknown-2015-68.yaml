place_of_death: "Ardebil"
province: "Ardebil"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Hanging"
circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown person, along with two others, was
    published on the website of the Ardebil Courthouse on March 8, 2015,
    quoting the Public Relations Office of the Ardebil General Courthouse.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of the defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Ardebil tried the defendant. No information is available on this
    trial. Charges The charge brought against the defendant was announced as
    smuggling 27 kilograms of heroin out of the country. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against the defendant was 27
    kilograms of heroin and a substancial amount of weapons and ammunition.
    Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment
    Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ardebil condemned the
    defendant to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. The
    defendant was hanged, along with two other defendants of this case, in
    Ardebil on February 26, 2015 in the morning.
