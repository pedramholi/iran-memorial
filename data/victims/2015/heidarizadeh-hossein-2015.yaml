    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Heidarizadeh, along with another
    person, was published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News
    Agency) on January 24, 2015. According to this report, seven prisoners
    were executed but only two names were announced. Official media did not
    publish news of these executions. Mr. Heidarizadeh was from the village of
    Garuk in Hormozgan province. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on Mr. Heidarizadeh s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Heidarizadeh s trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Heidarizadeh were announced as "transportation and possession
    of two kilograms narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Heidarizadeh. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Heidarizadeh's defense. Judgment Mr. Hossein Heidarizadeh
    was hanged at the Minab Prison yard on January 24, 2015.
