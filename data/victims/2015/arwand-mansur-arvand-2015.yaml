    Mansur Arvand, a well-known athlete from Mahabad, was very proud to be a
    Kurd and always wore Kurdish clothing. News of Mr. Mansur Arvand s
    execution was published by numerous sources including Kurdistan Democratic
    Party Website (June 15, 2015), HRANA (June 15, 2015), Voice of America
    (June 16, 2015), Rooz Online (June 16, 2015), and BBC Persian (June 18,
    2015). Additional information was obtained from an interview conducted by
    the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with his brother, Mr. Ebrahim Arwand
    (ABF Interview), and from other sources.* Mr. Mansur Arvand was a young
    Kurd and a well-known athlete from the [city of] Mahabad. He had a high
    school diploma, was married with two children, ages 16 and 7. In 2002-03,
    Mr. Arvand established the Javanmardan bodybuilding club in Mahabad, and
    in 2010-11, opened an expanded new location in the city center. He also
    owned a paint and industrial tools store. In the course of his career as
    an athlete, he obtained two national titles in wrestling including
    1stplace in the national wrestling competition in the [city of]
    Khorramabad in 1996-97 and six bodybuilding titles including 2ndplace in
    [the city of] Tabriz bodybuilding competition in 2006-7. (ABF Interview)
    According to Mr. Arvand s brother, he was very proud to be a Kurd and
    always wore [traditional] Kurdish clothing. He was upset to see young
    Kurds being drawn to drugs, and in order to prevent that, he had
    registered a large number of the city s youth at his club for free. He
    resisted his brother s insistence on leaving in Iran and traveling to
    Europe, and believed that providing young people with sports facilities
    was the least he good do to combat the spread of drug addiction. He was
    adamant about respecting women s rights and strived for equal rights for
    women. His club s morning shift, for instance, was reserved for women, and
    even though it wasn t making a lot of money, he charged women half the
    normal fee in order to encourage them to get into sports. (ABF Interview)
    Prior to his arrest, he was summoned and questioned on two occasions by
    Information Administration agents, including the time in March-April 2011
    when he had been summoned to Mahabad Information News Headquarters and
    questioned about why he was allowing young people to use his sports
    facility without expecting financial gain. He had also been chastised for
    playing Kurdish music at the club, wearing Kurdish clothes, and objecting
    to and confronting people who distributed drugs among the youth. (ABF
    Interview) Mr. Arvand had been a secret member of the Kurdistan Democratic
    Party in Mahabad since 2004-5. (Kurdistan Democratic Party Bulletin, June
    15, 2015). In prison, he read, and was learning English. His reading
    materials consisted of books other prisoners had brought into jail. (ABF
    Interview) The issuance and implementation of Mr. Arvand s sentence was
    followed by reactions and protests. The Kurdistan Democratic Party (June
    15, 2015) and the National Resistance Council (June 16, 2015) issued
    bulletins and objected to his execution. Protest meetings against his
    execution were also held in certain European cities, including Hamburg and
    Koln. Arrest and detention At midnight of June 11, 2011, Mr. Arvand and
    his brother were arrested at their home in Mahabad by a large number of
    armed Information Ministry agents - who did not produce an arrest warrant
    - and taken to Mahabad Information Administration Detention Center.
    According to his brother, Mr. Arvand was beaten, and his father and his
    family were gravely insulted during the arrest. In addition to his house,
    his sports club and his store were also searched and officially shut down
    that night without anyone from the family being present. His younger
    brother was released two weeks later but Mr. Arvand remained in the
    custody of security forces. After one month, the store and the sports club
    were allowed to be reopened and were turned over to the family, only to be
    shut down again two weeks later, and this time, permanently. (ABF
    Interview) Based on available information, he spent at least two weeks in
    Mahabad Information Administration Detention Center solitary confinement,
    and was subsequently transferred to [the city of] Orumieh Information
    Administration Detention Center, and ultimately to a detention center in
    Tehran. The precise date of his transfer is not available. During the four
    months he spent in solitary confinement cells of the Information
    Administration Detention Centers, he was deprived of the right to contact
    his family and access to an attorney. It was only on October 5, 2011,
    after four months, that the Information forces allowed him to contact his
    family for one minute and inform them of his transfer back to Mahabad. One
    week after this contact, Mr. Arvand s family was allowed to visit with him
    for a few minutes for the first time, and in the presence of security
    agents. According to his brother, he had gone from 230 pounds to 130
    pounds and the family could not recognize him. H
