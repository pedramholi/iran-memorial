    News of the execution of Mr. Shahnavazi, along with nine others not named,
    was published on the website of the Hormozgan General Courthouse, quoting
    the Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan General Courthouse, and on
    the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) with full names
    on August 17, 2015. Arrest and detention Mr. Shahnavazi was detained in
    Minab Prison. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial According to the website of the Hormozgan General Courthouse, the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Minab tried Mr. Shahnavazi. However, no
    information is available on his trial. Charges According to the Public
    Relations Office of the Hormozgan General Courthouse, the charge brought
    against Mr. Shahnavazi was announced as drug trafficking. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide
    any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Shahnavazi.
    However, according to the Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan General
    Courthouse, these ten executed drug traffickers in Minab and Bandar-e
    Abbas had been charged with possession, transportation, and selling over
    398 kilograms of narcotics including 70 kilograms of heroin, 200 kilograms
    of opium, 105 kilograms of crack, 4 kilograms of hashish, and 19 grams of
    morphine across the Hormozgan Province and the neighboring provinces.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Shahnavazi s defense. Judgment
    The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Minab condemned Mr. Shahnavazi to
    death. After the General Public Prosecutor confirmed the ruling, it was
    carried out on Monday August 17, 2015 and Mr. Shahnavazi was hanged, along
    with three others, at the Minab Central Prison yard in the morning.
