    News of the execution of Mr. Mas ud Rasuli, along with 20 others, was
    published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on
    March 4 and 5, 2015. Only six names were published in this report. News of
    this execution was not published in the official media. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Rasuli had probably been detained at the Greater Tehran
    Detention Center before being transferred to solitary confinement in
    Qezelhesar Prison on March 3, 2015. According to HRANA, he had his last
    visitation with his family at the Qezelhesar Prison. The circumstances of
    his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available
    on Mr. Rasuli s trial. Charges According to HRANA, the charges against Mr.
    Rasuli were announced as crimes related to narcotics. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Rasuli. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Rasuli s defense. Judgment Mr. Mas ud
    Rasuli was hanged at the Qezelhesar Prison yard in Karaj on Wednesday
    March 4, 2015 at dawn.
