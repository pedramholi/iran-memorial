    News of the prosecution and trial of Mr. Mohammad ali Kamalvand was
    published in the website of Mehrnews on June 8, 2014. News of his
    execution was published in the websites of the Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran on January 28, 2015, Iran newspaper and
    Farhikhtegan on January 29, 2015, quoting the Information Base of the
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. According to the
    existing information, Mr. Kamalvand was married and pretended to be a
    pharmacist helping his victims, but robbed them instead. Arrest and
    Detention According to the Information Base of the Revolutionary Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran, after several complaints were filed against
    him, Mr. Kamalvand was identified, prosecuted, and arrested on October 12,
    2013 (or on October 17, according to the Iran newspaper). According to the
    existing information, police arrested him in a motel at Suresrafil Street
    where he had anesthetized a young couple. He was detained for two and a
    half years. Trial Branch 113 of the Criminal Court of Tehran Revolutionary
    Public Court at District 27 tried Mr. Kamalvand. The first session took
    place on March 3, and the second session on March 17, 2014. Charges
    According to the Information Base of the Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s
    Office in Tehran, the charges against Mr. Kamalvand were "robbery,
    pretending to be a pharmacist, and rape." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Kamalvand was having a criminal record,
    eleven complaints against him, and his confession. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    During his last defense, Mr. Kamalvand stated that I accept the robbery
    charge but I did not commit the rape. He had an attorney. Because he and
    his attorney appealed the ruling, the case was referred to the Supreme
    Court. A Summary of the Legal Defects in Mr. Mohammad Ali Kamalvand s Case
    According to a Mehr News Agency report on June 8, 2014, Mr. Mohammad Ali
    Kamalvand declared in court that he did not accept the charge of rape. In
    accordance with Iranian laws, proving the commission of crimes subject to
    Hadd punishments has specific requirements. He did not make an admission
    of raping the victims. On the other hand, the plaintiffs had stated that
    the defendant had rendered them unconscious and raped them while they were
    in that state. It is therefore clear that neither the plaintiffs nor any
    other person witnessed the rape. Forcible rape is established when the
    defendant admits four times to the commission of the act, or four
    individuals testify thereto under specific circumstances. There was no
    possibility of testimony in this case and the defendant himself had made
    no confession. Even if the defendant had made a confession to raping the
    victims in the preliminary investigations stage, there would be no basis
    for issuing a death penalty because it is necessary that the confession be
    made in court and before the judge issuing the ruling. Therefore, if Mr.
    Ali Kamalvand had not made a confession before the issuing judge at any
    time in the course of the proceedings, it can be said that issuance of a
    capital sentence in his case was contrary to domestic laws. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Mohammad ali Kamalvand to ten years imprisonment and
    74 lashes for robbery, to two years imprisonment for pretending to be a
    pharmacist, and to three counts death for rape. Branch 11 of the Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling. The ruling was carried out on January 28, 2015
    and he was hanged at the Evin Prison yard. It is unknown whether the lash
    ruling was carried out.
