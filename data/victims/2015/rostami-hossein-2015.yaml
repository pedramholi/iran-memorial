    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Rostami, along with several others
    reported in various sources between 4 and 11, was published on the
    websites of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) and the Iran Human
    Rights Organization on September 7, 2015. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Rostami s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    No information is available on Mr. Rostami s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Rostami was announced as related to narcotics. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Rostami. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Rostami s defense. Judgment Mr. Hossein Rostami was hanged at the
    Qezelhesar Prison on September 7, 2015 at dawn. No specific information is
    available about this execution.
