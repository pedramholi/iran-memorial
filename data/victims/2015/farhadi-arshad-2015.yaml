    News of the execution of Mr. Arshad Farhadi, along with nine others, was
    published on the website of Nafasdarqafas on January 23, 2015. Arrest and
    Detention Mr. Farhadi was detained at Section 15 of the Orumieh Prison.
    There is no specific information on his arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Farhadi s trial. Charges The charge
    against Mr. Farhadi was announced as "drug trafficking." The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Farhadi.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Farhadi s defense. Judgment Mr.
    Arshad Farhadi was hanged at Orumieh Central Prison on January 21, 2015.
    No specific information is available about this execution.
