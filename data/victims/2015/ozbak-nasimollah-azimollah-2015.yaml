    News of the execution of Mr. Nasimollah (Azimollah) Ozbak, along with
    three others, was published on the websites of HRANA (Human Rights
    Activists News Agency), and the Human Rights and Democracy Activists in
    Iran on March 16, 2015. Three of these executed individuals were from
    Afghanistan and have a last name of Ozbak; however, it is not clear
    whether they are related. Mr. Ozbak, 25, was an Afghan citizen. Arrest and
    detention According to the Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran,
    Mr. Ozbak was detained in the Zahedan Central Prison. The circumstances of
    his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available
    on Mr. Ozbak s trial. Charges According to HRANA, the charge brought
    against Mr. Ozbak was announced as crimes related to narcotics. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Ozbak. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ozbak s
    defense. Judgment Mr. Nasimollah (Azimollah) Ozbak was hanged, along with
    three others, at Zahedan Prison on March 7, 2015.
