    News of the execution of Mr. Ahmad Reza M. along with three others, was
    published on the website of the Markazi Provincial Courthouse on May 19,
    2015. According to this source, these executions took place to combat drug
    traffickers. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Ahmad Reza M. s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch One of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Khomein tried Mr. Ahmad Reza M. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges According to the Markazi Provincial
    Courthouse, the charges brought against Mr. Ahmad Reza M, were announced
    as selling 11 grams of methamphetamine, possession of 601 grams of heroin
    and 379 grams of methamphetamine. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Ahmad Reza M. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Ahmad Reza M s defense. Judgment Branch
    One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Khomein condemned Mr. Ahmad Reza
    M. to death, the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and the Head of
    Judiciary validated it. He was hanged, along with three others, at the
    Arak Central Prison yard on May 19, 2015.
