    News of the execution of Mr. Shahruz (without a last name), along with
    four others, was published on the websites of Jamejam on April 16, 2015,
    Javanonline on April 17, 2015, and the Iran Human Rights Organization on
    May 3, 2015. According to the existing information, he worked in a
    restaurant and his case was related to the murder of the restaurant owner
    in Hakimieh, Tehran, on March 16, 2011. Arrest and detention On the day of
    the incident, when police agents of the Tehranpars police station 144
    arrived at the scene, they realized that Mr. Shahruz had a fought with the
    restaurant owner and had fled. He was arrested after a while. However, the
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch 113
    of the Tehran Criminal Court tried Mr. Shahruz. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Shahruz was
    announced as murdering a restaurant owner. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Shahruz was his confession. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Shahruz s defense. However, during the interrogation, he stated that
    he had drunk alcoholic beverages on the day of the incident. Judgment
    Branch 113 of the Tehran Criminal Court condemned Mr. Shahruz to death and
    the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along with four
    others, at the Gohardasht Prison yard in Karaj on April 16, 2015.
