    and information regarding the execution of Mr. Farshad Haqi, son of

    Boroumand Center with three of his acquaintances on May 19, 2019, June 13,
    19, and 26, 2019, and July 6, 2019. News of this execution was also
    published in Iran newspaper (November 25, 2015), Javan Online website
    (November 25, 2015), and HRANA, Human Rights Activists News Agency
    (November 24, 2015). Additional information regarding this execution was
    obtained from Iran Human Rights Organization (December 14, 2015). Mr. Haqi
    was born on May 26, 1984, in Shahr-e Rey, in southern Tehran Province. He
    had a high school diploma. He worked for a time as a welder, and
    subsequently became a road construction contractor with his father. He was
    married and had a child. (Boroumand Center interview, May 19, and July 6,
    2019; Iran Human Right Organization). Mr. Haqi was a funny, sociable, and
    empathetic family man who loved his wife and child very much and planned
    for the future of his family. He liked bodybuilding and liked travelling
    and spending time with his friends in his spare time. (Boroumand Center
    interview, May 19, and July 6, 2019). Mr. Haqi s case is related to the
    death of an individual during an altercation on September 10, 2006. Arrest
    and detention According to available information, on September 11, 2006,
    Mr. Haqi turned himself over to the Police 110, and was arrested by the
    Shahr-e Rey s Dolatabad [neighborhood] police at the home of one of his
    relatives in Tehran s District 18. He was first transferred to the
    Criminal Investigation Bureau s Shahpur Street Precinct and was detained
    there for about a month. According to the person interviewed by the
    Boroumand Center, Mr. Haqi was tortured during that period. While Mr. Haqi
    was at the detention center, a number of the officers there suggested on
    several occasions to his family and relatives that they should pay them
    bribes in order to change the circumstances of Mr. Haqi s case and reduce
    the charge against him. However, his family refused to do so because of
    their moral values and because they believed that what had happened was an
    accident and that Mr. Haqi deserved to be forgiven. (Boroumand Center
    interview, May 19, June 13, and July 6, 2019; Iran Human Right
    Organization). Mr. Haqi was transferred to [the city of] Karaj s
    Rajaishahr Prison in the fall of 2006. A person who knew Mr. Haqi
    described his mental condition in the first days of his arrival at the
    prison as really awful , and said: He was kind of lost and confused for a
    while, and didn t even know how to make contact with the outside. Mr. Haqi
    contacted his family for the first time about two months after his arrest.
    Less than six months after the arrest, he had a cabin visitation with his
    family. His child was approximately 2 months old at the time. For the
    following 9 years that he spent in jail, Mr. Haqi called his family almost
    regularly, 2 or 3 times a week, had cabin visitations with them once a
    month, and had in-person visitations with them every 3 or 4 months. For
    approximately 5 years after his arrest and before his wife asked for a
    divorce, he had conjugal visits with her every 2 to 3 months. According to
    the person who knew Mr. Haqi, the in-person visitations took place in a
    very small space shared with a multitude of other prisoners and their
    families; none of the families had enough private space nor the
    possibility to talk to each other in peace. According to this person,
    during Mr. Haqi s incarceration, prisoners did not even have the
    possibility of close contact with family members during in-person
    visitations. This person also noted the prison guards mistreatment of
    prisoners, including Mr. Haqi, in front of their families. (Boroumand
    Center interview, May 19, and June 26, 2019). During his incarceration,
    Mr. Haqi was taken into solitary confinement on numerous occasions for
    anywhere between several days to a week, for various reasons such as being
    in possession of a cell phone or being in a scuffle. He did not have the
    opportunity to inform his family that he was being taken to solitary, and
    he would sometimes send messages to them through his ward mates. Persons
    who knew Mr. Haqi described him as antagonistic, tense, and withdrawn
    after every stint in solitary. (Boroumand Center interview, May 19, and
    June 13, 2019). Mr. Haqi had gotten tired of his case being pending and at
    a standstill during his incarceration and especially in the final months,
    and had submitted several written requests asking for a resolution.
    (Boroumand Center interview, July 6, 2019). During his phone conversations
    and visitations, Mr. Haqi had constantly complained about the conditions
    in prison including hygiene, food, and security. He had also said that the
    prisoners had to pay for the heating and air conditioning syste
