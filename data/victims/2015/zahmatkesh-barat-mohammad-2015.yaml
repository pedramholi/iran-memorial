    News of the execution of Mr. Barat (Mohammad) Zahmatkesh, along with 26
    others, was sent by an informed source to the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation on April 16, 2015. According to this source, close to 171
    individuals had been executed in connection with narcotics in Iran s
    prisons between April 12 and 14, 2015. Iran Human Rights Organization
    published the news on April 15, 2016. The judicial authorities announced
    the execution of only 8 individuals without their names. Additionally,
    HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) published a video from Mr.
    Zahmatkesh recorded a few days before his execution in Qezelhesar Prison.
    In this video, he described his case briefly and demanded that human
    rights organizations save him. (April 17, 2016) According to Mr.
    Zahmatkesh s statement in the video, he was married, from Quchan, and an
    athlete who won several provincial, national, and Asian titles for karate
    and kickboxing. Arrest and detention Mr. Zahmatkesh was arrested at his
    house. When he entered the house, officials had handcuffed his wife, his
    child, and his neighbor. His daughter-in-law, who was nine-months
    pregnant, was beaten up. They took all the family members to the base and
    released them later. Mr. Zahmatkesh was detained for six years (video). He
    was imprisoned at Unit 2 in the Qezelhesar Prison (Boroumand Foundation).
    The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial In the
    video, Mr. Zahmatkesh spoke of his unjust prosecution. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges According to the existing information, the
    charges brought against Mr. Zahmatkesh were offenses related to narcotics.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Zahmatkesh was possession of 2 kilograms and 800 grams of
    crack. (video) Defense In the video, Mr. Zahmatkesh stated that his
    enemies hid the narcotics in his son s house and that he and his son had
    no information about it. He had been forced to accept the charge to
    support his family and their honor. Judgment Mr. Barat (Mohammad)
    Zahmatkesh was hanged, along with 10 or 14 others, at the Qezelhesar
    Prison in Karaj on April 13, 2015.
