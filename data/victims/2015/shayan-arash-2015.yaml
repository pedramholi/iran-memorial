    News of the execution of Mr. Arash (Shayan) was published on the website
    of the Hamshahri newspaper, with the name of Arash, on February 1, 2015
    and on the website of Javanonline, with the name of Shayan, on February 2,
    2015. Based on the information in these reports, both names refer to one
    individual. This case is about a murder that took place on June 7, 2009
    when the victim died due to injuries resulting from several blows of a
    knife. Mr. Arash (Shayan) was charged with committing this murder in
    collaboration with his friend and the victim s wife. She informed the
    Police in Mahdasht, Karaj, that two masked men had entered her house,
    murdered her husband, and escaped. Her statement about stolen money, gold,
    and valuables and the cluttered house indicated that robbery was a
    possibility; however, after awhile, the police detectives suspected a
    relationship between the victim s wife and a man. Arrest and detention The
    Intelligence Police arrested Mr. Arash (Shayan) along with his
    collaborator in June of 2009. He was arrested several days after the
    victim s wife had confessed to their relationship. He was detained for
    five years. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Branch 80 of the Criminal Court of Alborz Province tried Mr. Arash
    (Shayan) and two other defendants in this case in the presence of five
    judges. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Arash (Shayan) was announced as murder. During her
    interrogation, the victim s wife stated that she knew Mr. Arash for three
    years. He had asked her to marry him after realizing her marital problems.
    They both planned to eliminate her husband. On the day of the incident,
    Mr. Arash and his friend entered the couple s house when the husband was
    in the bathroom. When he saw two unfamiliar men in his house, he attacked
    them and the fight began. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Arash (Shayan) was his confession and the confession of his
    friend and collaborator in addition to the confession of the victim s
    wife. International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned
    the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense According to the Hamshahri newspaper, Mr. Arash
    (Shayan) and two other defendants in the case defended themselves in front
    of the judges; however, no information is available on their defense.
    Judgment Branch 80 of the Criminal Court of Alborz Province condemned Mr.
    Arash (Shayan) to death and Branch 11 of the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged in the Raja ishahr (Gohardasht) Prison in Karaj on
    January 28, 2015 at dawn. The two other defendants in this case were
    condemned to imprisonment for collaboration in the murder.
