    Mr. Mohammadi was a young, single, Sunni Kurd, and a Gardening (Flowers
    and Plants) student at Tehran University. News of Mr. Sediq Mohammadi s
    execution along with five other individuals, was published by various
    sources including Kalemeh TV (March 4, 2015), HRANA (March 4, 2015), and
    Deutsche Welle Radio (March 4, 2015). The Judiciary Branch news agency
    (Mizan Online, March 4, 2015) also announced the news of the execution of
    six individuals in Rajai Shahr Prison, without stating their names.
    Additional information was obtained through an interview conducted by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with one of his cellmates and with Mr.
    Hamed Ahmadi, the spokesman for Rajai Shahr Prison Sunni prisoners (ABF
    Interview) in the weeks leading to the execution, prisoners video messages
    and audio interviews with television networks and other media from inside
    prison and other sources*. Mr. Mohammadi was a young, single, Sunni Kurd,
    residing in [the town of] Javanrud Kermanshah. He was a Gardening (Flowers
    and Plants) student at Tehran University, and the son of a middle class
    family. Mr. Mohammadi was a religious man and an adherent of the Shafe i**
    branch [of Islam]. He engaged in religious activities at the university
    and in his place of residence, including distributing religious CD s and
    printed materials. According to his prison mate, he was a pleasant,
    patient, and forgiving man who helped other prisoners and, in addition to
    daily chores and cooking, he was studying, reading, and doing religious
    activities including conducting religious classes. (ABF Interview) Mr.
    Mohammadi did not belong to any group or organization. He and the other
    prisoners sentenced to death were proselytizing the Shafe i religion, and
    according to themselves, were trying to prevent people being taken
    advantage of in the name of religion. (Center for Supporters of Human
    Rights, May 4, 2014) Background Based on existing information, in the
    years 2007 to 2009-10, numerous insults were made by promoters of the Shi
    a religion against Sunni beliefs and individuals who commanded their
    respect, causing the reaction of Sunni religious personalities and
    activists. Following offensive remarks made by Ebrahim Hatamikia (famous
    Shi a film director) against Aisha (the Prophet Mohammad s wife) in an
    interview with Khanevadeh Sabz Magazine (Volume 195, 2007), and statements
    made by well-known preachers including Hojjatoleslam Daneshmand,
    Hojjatoleslam Juybari, and Hojjatoleslam Ansari whose lectures were at
    times covered by state-run radio and television a number of religious
    Sunni youth from Kurdistan considered these insults to have been organized
    [by the state]. They started religious classes, distributing CD s and
    books in local mosques, universities, and their neighborhoods, and
    protested these actions, shedding light on [the motives], promoting and
    defending the principles of the Shafe i religion. These CD s included
    documented cases offensive to Sunni beliefs, quoting religious
    authoritative and reputable sources such as Bihar al-Anwar. These young
    people s religious activities aroused the security apparatus suspicions.
    Subsequent to Ayatollah Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj in May 2009, a number
    of young Sunni Kurd religious activists were arrested in the name of the
    fight against Salafi and heretic movements. Three months after these
    arrests, [a number of] assassinations were carried out in Sanandaj,
    including those of Mamusta Shiekholeslam, member of the Assembly of
    Experts, and Molla Borjhan Aali, a Sunni cleric. The security forces
    accused individuals that had already been arrested prior theses
    assassinations. Although the charge of assassination was not brought up in
    court and the arrestees were tried for Moharebeh, the charge was,
    nevertheless, constantly mentioned on news media and by judicial and
    security officials. The defendants denied any and all relations with
    armed, radical, and extremist groups, objected to the charges brought
    against them and demanded an open re-trial, to which they got no response.
    Ultimately, six of the detainees were executed in January 2013 and another
    six on March 4, 2015. The issuance and implementation of the death
    sentence against this group of Sunni defendants caused much reaction by
    individuals and domestic and international institutions. In June 2014, 19
    human rights organizations objected to the sentences and demanded that
    they be revoked. Additionally, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch,
    the Center for Human Rights Defenders, and the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation issuing bulletins and a number of calls to action, demanded the
    revocation of the defendants death sentence and a fair, transparent, an
    open trial. Sunni religious personalities, including Molavi Abdolhamid,
    [city of] Zahedan Friday Prayer Imam, Hassan Amini, Sanandaj s Imam
    Bokhara Seminary s mufti and director, and Molana Gergij [city of]
    Azadshahr Friday Prayer Imam, wrote open letters to the Leader [of the
    Islamic Republic] and
