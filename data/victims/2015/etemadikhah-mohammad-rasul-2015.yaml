    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Rasul E temadikhah, along with nine
    others, was published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News
    Agency) on January 21, 2015. According to HRANA, the official media of the
    Islamic Republic did not report this execution so far. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on Mr. E temadikhah s arrest
    and detention. Trial No information is available on Mr. E temadikhah s
    trial. Charges The charge against Mr. E temadikhah was announced as
    "related to narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. E temadikhah. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. E temadikhah's defense. Judgment Mr. Mohammad Rasul E
    temadikhah was hanged in the Tayebad Prison on January 11, 2015. No
    specific information is available about this execution.
