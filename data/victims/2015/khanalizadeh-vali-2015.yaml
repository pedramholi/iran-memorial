    News of the execution of Mr. Vali Khan alizadeh was announced by Fars News
    Agency (March 3, 2016) and the websites of Meshkin Rassa and Gunaz TV
    (March 4, 2016). Mr. Khan alizadeh, son of Saheb, was born in 1991 (Gunaz
    TV) or 1989 (Meshkin Rassa). His case pertains to crimes connected to
    illegal drugs. Arrest and detention Mr. Khan alizadeh was arrested by the
    police force on the road from Meshkinshahr to Tehran in 2012. According to
    the available information, Mr. Khan alizadeh broke a bone in his leg
    during the arrest. However, the judiciary authorities refused to make
    available the necessary medical care for his treatment. Trial There is no
    information available on the details of the session or sessions of Mr.
    Khan alizadeh s trial. Charges Mr. Khan alizadeh was charged with carrying
    1.5 kilograms of methamphetamine. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt There is no information available on details of the evidence of
    guilt entered against Mr. Khan alizadeh. Defense There is no information
    available on the details of Mr. Khan alizadeh s defense. Judgment The
    court sentenced Mr. Vali Khan alizadeh to death. The verdict was validated
    by the Chief Public Prosecutor. According to available information, the
    authorities prepared Mr. Khan alizadeh for execution against the advice of
    the prison doctor who said he had severely broken his ankle and as such
    should receive medical care before the sentence was carried out. Mr. Khan
    alizadeh fell to the ground by the gallows, but the authorities went ahead
    with the execution. Mr. Khan alizadeh was hanged in Meshkinshahr Prison on
    March 3, 2016.
