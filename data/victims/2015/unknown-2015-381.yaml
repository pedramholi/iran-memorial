    News of the execution of an unknown person, along with seven others, was
    published on the website of Kurdpa, Kurdistan Press Agency, on October 12,
    2015. This person was a Kurd citizen. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of the defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against the defendant was dealing narcotics. No detailed
    information is available on his charge. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned the defendant to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. The defendant was hanged at the Darya Prison yard in Orumieh on
    October 12, 2015 at dawn. No specific information is available about his
    execution.
