    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Kazem Yazdani Doborun, 55, born in
    Mashhad, along with seven others, was published on the websites of Central
    News Unit on February 22, Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse on February 25,
    2015 without naming him. However, the HRANA (Human Rights Activists News
    Agency) website published his name among the list of executed individuals
    on February 22, 2015. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on Mr. Yazdani Doborun s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Yazdani Doborun s trial. Charges According
    to the website of Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse, quoting the Head of
    Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse, the charge against Mr. Yazdani Doborun
    was "drug trafficking." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Yazdani Doborun. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Yazdani Doborun's defense. Judgment Mr. Mohammad Kazem
    Yazdani Doborun was hanged in Bandar-e Abbas on February 22, 2015. No
    further information is available regarding this execution.
