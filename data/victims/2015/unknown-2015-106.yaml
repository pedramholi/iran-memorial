    News of the execution of an unknown individual along with two others was
    announced by the website of HRANA on March 28, 2015. The case of this
    unknown individual pertains to illegal drugs. Arrest and Detention There
    is no information available on the details of this unknown individual s
    arrest and detention. Trial There is no information available on the
    details of the session or sessions of his trial. Charges This unknown
    individual s charges pertain to illegal drugs. However, there is no
    information available on the details of the charges brought against this
    unknown individual. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt There is no information available on the details of the evidence of
    guilt entered against this unknown individual. Defense There is no
    information available on the details of this unknown individual s defense.
    Judgment The court sentenced this unknown individual to death. This
    unknown individual was hanged, along with two others, in the courtyard of
    Vakilabad Prison of Mashhad on the morning of March 26, 2015. There is no
    information available on the details of this verdict.
