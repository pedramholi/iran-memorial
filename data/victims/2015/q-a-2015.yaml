circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. A. Q., along with another person, was
    published on the website of the Mazandaran General Courthouse on May 31,
    2015, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Mazandaran General
    Courthouse. His case was related to drug trafficking. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of Mr. A. Q. s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Mr. A. Q. was tried in Sari. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. A. Q. was announced as drug
    trafficking. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. A. Q. was transportation of one kilogram and 40 grams of
    heroin. Defense No information is available on Mr. A. Q. s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. A. Q. to death and he was hanged, along
    with another person, in the presence of the General Public Prosecutor of
    Mazandarn at the Sari Prison yard on May 31, 2015. The Pardon Committee of
    the Judiciary twice denied his pardon request.
