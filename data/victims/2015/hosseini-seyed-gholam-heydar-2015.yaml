    News of the death in detention of Mr. Seyed Gholam Heydar Hosseini, son of
    Seyed Gholam Hossein, was announced by the websites of Islamic Republic
    News Agency-IRNA (August 24, 2015), Tasnim News Agency (August 22, 2015),
    Human Rights Activists News Agency- HRANA (August 23, 2015), and the
    Afghanpaper website (August 20, 2015). Additional information in this
    regard was obtained through Abdorrahman Boroumand Center research and
    interviews with his son, Mr. Seyed Ahmad Hosseini on August 26, 2015, who
    was detained with him. Mr. Seyed Gholam Heydar Hosseini was born on 1961
    in Afghanistan. After immigrating to Iran, he worked as a construction
    worker for about 30 years. Background Iran has long been host to one of
    the largest displaced populations in the world due to its 937 kilometer
    border and common language with a large part of the Afghan population.
    Millions who fled conflict and repression during the late 1970s and early
    1980s when the Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan, or during the civil war
    and especially after the Taliban took power in 1996, left their homeland
    and mostly fled to Pakistan and Iran. Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of
    the Islamic Republic, emphasized hosting Afghans in 1979. Therefore, Iran
    gave asylum and some assistance to Afghan refugees from 1979 to 1992.
    However, after the Afghan Mojahedin came to power in 1992, the Iranian
    government began encouraging and pressuring Afghans to return to
    Afghanistan through various measures, including the implementation of
    onerous procedures for renewing refugee papers, refusal to register newly
    arriving Afghans as refugees, and denial of public services to refugees.
    As a result, about a million Afghans returned to their homeland in a short
    period. This policy has continued up to now in spite of increasing Afghan
    migration caused by dire security condition in Afghanistan since 2008.
    Authorities arrest undocumented Afghans and detain them in camps assigned
    for aliens before returning them to their country. Meanwhile, the United
    Nations offered financial assistance to the Iranian government in order to
    support minimum living conditions for refugees and their voluntarily
    return.* According to the Iranian Labor Law, Article 120, foreign
    nationals cannot work in Iran unless they first have a valid entry visa
    with a specific work authorization and, secondly, receive work permits in
    accordance with the relevant laws and regulations. In order to regulate
    the residence and employment of the Afghans in Iran, the Ministry of the
    Interior, in cooperation with the Police Force, adopted a scheme for
    registering foreign nationals after 2000. The officials started to conduct
    a census of Afghan refugees, collect their information, and issue a
    residence card and a work permit for each Afghan refugees. Afghan refugees
    who for any reason did not participate in this project, were treated as
    criminals and collected, arrested, detained, and eventually deported from
    Iran. Many violations of the basic rights and dignity of the detainees
    during the execution of this project have been reported. Arrest and
    detention The project of collecting and registering illegal foreign
    nationals resumed in 2015, and police forces began to arrest large numbers
    of undocumented foreign nationals in Mashhad and several other cities. Mr.
    Heydar Hosseini was thus arrested by law enforcement in the city of
    Panjtan on Wednesday, August 12, 2015 while he was going to work, and
    transferred to the city of Hassan Abad in Shandiz along with other
    detainees. According to Mr. Heydar Hosseini s son, he himself was arrested
    along with his younger brother as an illegal alien in the city of Panjtan
    and was transferred to Hassan Abad. In Hassan Abad, the brothers found out
    about their father s arrest and eventually they were all transferred to
    the Sefid Sang camp in Fariman, Khorasan e Razavi. About 2,500 detainees
    were kept in a prefabricated metal building which was about 1,500 square
    meters. Facility officials gave two very dirty blankets to each detainee,
    and there was not even enough space for the detainees to sleep and rest.
    The sanitary conditions there were extremely bad. The building was about
    six meters in height and there was a small vent on its window. The
    ventilation was not suitable in any way, and the smell of sweat and
    toilets inside the building was unbearable, especially in the hot summer
    weather (ABC interview). Death of Mr. Seyed Gholam Heydar Hosseini The
    published information regarding Mr. Heydar Hosseini s death was
    contradictory. According to the testimony of his son who was with Mr.
    Heydar Hosseini at the Sefid Sang detention facility, Mr. Heydar
    Hosseini's deterioration was due to the highly unsuitable situation inside
    the building and officials neglect: After about two days of detention in
    that unsuitable situation, around 2:30 PM on Friday, August 14, 2015, my
    dad felt sick. We took my father with difficulty next to the door through
    the crowd. We knocked on the door and asked for
