    News of Mr. Behruz Alkhani s execution along with five other individuals
    was published by multiple sources including Amnesty International (August
    26, 2015), HRANA (August 25, 2015), and the Campaign to Defend Civil and
    Political Prisoners in Iran (August 26, 2015). Additional information
    about this case was obtained from the transcript of the official court
    decision, Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interview with two of his
    brothers and one of his ward mates (Boroumand Center interview), and other
    sources.* Mr. Alkhani was a single, young ethnic Kurd, residing in the
    town of Salmas in Western Azarbaijan Province. He was a [mountain] porter
    but had been unemployed after the closing off of the border a year before
    his arrest, and had started transporting goods with his small truck.
    (Revolutionary Court Decision transcript). He was a supporter of Kurdistan
    Free Life Party (PJAK). The Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) is a leftist
    organization established in January 2004 with the aim of creating "a
    democratic-ecological and gender-equal society" within the framework of a
    democratic and federal government in Iran, where autonomy is granted to
    all ethnic minorities. It held its first congress on 25 April 2004. The
    party, led by Abdul Rahman Haji Ahmadi, has very close ties with the PKK
    Party in Turkey, and regards Apo "Abdullah Ocalan" as its spiritual
    leader. PJAK mostly has influence in the northern parts of Iranian
    Kurdistan, where it is engaged in an armed struggle against the Islamic
    Republic. PJAK refers to Iranian Kurdistan as East Kurdistan. Mr. Alkhani
    s case is related to the assassination of [the town of] Khoi prosecutor,
    Mr. Vali Haji Gholizadeh** on January 18, 2010. Iranian governmental and
    judiciary officials announced that PJAK had officially accepted
    responsibility for the assassination, but PJAK denied that claim, and, in
    an interview with Rooz Online, PJAK leader Abdorrahman Haji Ahmadi stated
    that he had no knowledge of the identity of those responsible for the Khoi
    prosecutor s assassination. (Rooz Online, January 20, 2010). Human rights
    organizations reacted to Mr. Alkhani s execution. Amnesty International
    issued an announcement in which it stated that his execution while his
    case was still pending at the Supreme Court and under consideration,
    constituted a serious breach of Iranian and international law and an
    affront to international justice. (Amnesty International, Mr. Alkhani had
    a prior record of arrest and conviction for trafficking in gas-oil, and
    for illegally crossing the border into Turkey (Criminal Court Decision
    transcript). Arrest and detention Salmas Information Administration forces
    arrested Mr. Alkhani in the town of Salmas on January 27, 2010. He spent
    19 months in solitary confinement at Information detention centers in
    thetowns of Salmas, Khoi, and Orumieh. Mr. Alkhani s family had no
    knowledge of his whereabouts after his arrest, and their efforts to locate
    and obtain information regarding their child s condition bore no fruit.
    Security forces denied his arrest for a long time, and would not allow him
    to contact, or have visitations with, his family (HRANA, September 4,
    2010). Mr. Alkahani was subjected to psychological and physical torture
    during his detention at the Information Administration. According to Mr.
    Alkhani s brother, he had been tortured during detention. They had drilled
    a hole into his ankle and broken his fingers. They gave my brother
    electric shocks and beat him up with a cable on numerous occasions .
    (Campaign to Defend Civil and Political Prisoners in Iran). Amnesty
    International also reported that he had been under torture. According to
    Mr. Alkhani s brother, Behruz had lost his mental stability because of the
    blows he had received to his head, so much so that one of his trial
    sessions was postponed because of the severity of his psychological
    condition. (Campaign to Defend Civil and Political Prisoners in Iran). On
    Thursday, November 20, 2014, Mr. Alkhani and 28 other political prisoners
    at Orumieh Prison s Ward 12 began a hunger strike that lasted 33 days,
    protesting the non-separation of prisoners according to their crimes,
    denying political prisoners their own independent ward, and in order to
    put an end to prison officials inappropriate treatment of prisoners and
    their families,. (Campaign to Defend Civil and Political Prisoners in
    Iran, August 25, 2015). Trial On October 15, 2011, Orumieh Revolutionary
    Court, Branch One, tried Mr. Alkhani (as the Principal Defendant) and
    three others, in a closed session (Revolutionary Court Decision
    transcript). The trial took place in the presence of Mr. Alkhani s
    court-appointed attorney, the prosecutor s representative, and the Orumieh
    Information Administration representative. (Kurdistan Human Rights
    Organization, April 23, 2014). After the Supreme Court overturned the
    trial court s ruling, Orumieh Revolutionary Court Branch 16 tried him a
    second time. This time, the court session took place in the presence
