    News of the execution of Mr. Mansur Gholamzadeh, along with seven others,
    without naming three of them, was published on the websites of HRANA
    (Human Rights Activists News Agency) and the Human Rights Activists for
    Democracy in Iran on April 14, 2015. Arrest and detention According to
    HRANA and the Human Rights Activists for Democracy in Iran, Mr.
    Gholamzadeh was transferred from Hall 11 of Section 4 in the Central
    Prison in Karaj to solitary confinement of Andarzgah 5 in the Raja ishahr
    (Gohardasht) Prison. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Gholamzadeh s trial.
    Charges According to HRANA, the charge brought against Mr. Gholamzadeh was
    related to narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Gholamzadeh. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Gholamzadeh s defense. Judgment Mr. Mansur Gholamzadeh
    was hanged, along with seven others, at the Raja ishahr (Gohardasht)
    Prison on April 14, 2015.
