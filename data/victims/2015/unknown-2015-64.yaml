    News of the execution of an unknown 66-year old man was announced by
    Khorasan daily on February 18, 2015. This case pertains to the murder of
    the geriatric uncle of this unknown man. According to the available
    report, the defendant and the victim became involved in a fight, on
    September 16, 2008, in a farming dispute over the irrigation of an
    orchard, which ended in the murder of the victim as a result of receiving
    a blows with a club. Arrest and detention This unknown man was arrested by
    the police after the putrefying corpse of his 82-year old uncle was
    discovered under stones in a farming area of a village near Ghoochan in
    November 2008. He spent six years in prison. Trial This unknown man was
    tried by Branch Seven of the Public Court of Khorasan Province in the
    course of a couple of sessions. However, there is no information available
    on the details of the sessions of this unknown individual s trial. Charges
    The court charged this unknown individual with murder. He was accused of
    clubbing the victim to death during the fight and then burying his corpse
    under the stones. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the available information, the clear confessions of the
    defendant as well as the content of the case, including the report of the
    police agents and the coroner, were among the evidence that were entered
    against this unknown individual. International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense The defense lawyer objected to
    the verdict issued by the court. However, there is no information
    available on the details of this unknown individual s defense. Judgment
    The court sentenced this unknown individual to death. His case was
    referred to Branch 11 of the Tribunal of Official Justice, but the issued
    verdict was validated there as well. This unknown individual was hanged in
    Mashhad Central Prison, in the presence of the judiciary authorities and
    the coroner, on February 17, 2015.
