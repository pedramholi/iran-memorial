    News of the execution of an unknown man along with nine others was
    announced by the website of HRANA on March 3, 2015. The case of this
    unknown individual pertains to murder. Arrest and Detention There is no
    information available on the details of this unknown individual s arrest
    and detention. Trial There is no information available on the details of
    the session or sessions of his trial. Charges This unknown individual was
    charged with murder. However, there is no information available on the
    details of the charges brought against him. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence of guilt entered against this unknown
    individual. Defense There is no information available on the details of
    this unknown individual s defense. Judgment The court sentenced this
    unknown individual to death. This unknown individual was hanged, along
    with nine others, in the courtyard of Adelabad Prison of Shiraz on the
    morning of March 3, 2015. There is no information available on the details
    of this verdict.
