    News of the execution of Mr. Farhad Ebrahimi, along with seven others, was
    published on the Kurdistan Human Rights Network on September 22, 2015.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Ebrahimi s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Ebrahimi
    s trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Ebrahimi was announced as
    related to narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against Mr. Ebrahimi. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ebrahimi s defense. Judgment Mr. Farhad Ebrahimi was
    executed, along with five others, at the Orumieh Central Prison on July
    25, 2015. According to an informed source, these prisoners were hanged
    while the rulings against two of them were yet to be confirmed by the
    Supreme Court. Therefore, the families of these two defendants filed a
    complaint against the Public Prosecutor of Orumieh.
