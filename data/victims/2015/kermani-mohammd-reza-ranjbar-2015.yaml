    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Ranjbar Kermani, known as
    Yakuza, was published on the website of the Gilan Provincial Courthouse on
    February 23, 2015, quoting the Public Relations Office of this courthouse.
    According to this report, he had a criminal record for drug trafficking
    and had been condemned to life imprisonment. Arrest and Detention Mr.
    Ranjbar Kermani was arrested in Bandar-e Anzali while he was on leave from
    prison based on an Open Sentence. * There is no specific information on
    his arrest and detention. He was imprisoned at the Rasht Central Prison
    until his execution. Trial Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Rasht tried Mr. Ranjbar Kermani for the first time and, while he was
    waiting his sentence, Branch One of this court tried him again for a new
    charge. No further information is available on his trial. Charges The
    charge against Mr. Ranjbar Kermani was announced as "selling 13.7
    kilograms of methamphetamine," during his first trial by Branch Two of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Rasht. He was additionally charged by
    Branch One of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Rasht for attempting to
    possess and hide 325 grams of heroin in his clothes during a visitation
    with his relatives in the Rasht Prison. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Ranjbar Kermani in
    both his trials was attempting to sell 13.7 kilograms of methamphetamine,
    and recovery of 325 grams of heroin from his clothes, during a prison
    visitation. Mr. Ranjbar Kermani had been previously condemned to life
    imprisonment for supplying, possession, transportation, and hiding 195
    kilograms of opium in Bam, Kerman. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Ranjbar Kermani's defense. Judgment Two Branches of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Rasht, separately, condemned Mr. Mohammad Reza
    Ranjbar Kermani to death. The Supreme Court and the General Public
    Prosecutor s Office confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in the Rasht
    Central Prison on February 23, 2015. ----------------------------------- *
    Some convicts can work and live outside the prison after certain
    conditions are met and with the condition of not getting involved in
    illegal activities. (ABF research)
