    News of the execution of Ms. Batul A., along with three others, was
    published on the website of the Markazi Provincial Courthouse on May 13,
    2015. According to this source, these executions took place to combat drug
    traffickers. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Ms. Batul A. s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch Two of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Arak tried Ms. Batul A. No information is available
    on her trial. Charges According to the Markazi Provincial Courthouse, the
    charge brought against Ms. Batul A, was announced as participation in
    transferring 19.2 kilograms of heroin. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against Ms. Batul A.
    Defense No information is available on Ms. Batul A. s defense. Judgment
    Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Arak condemned Ms. Batul
    A. to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling and the Head of
    Judiciary validated. She was hanged, along with three others, at the Arak
    Central Prison yard on May 12, 2015.
