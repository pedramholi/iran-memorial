    News of the execution of an unknown 45-year old man was announced by the
    website of the Central News Unit and the local Shahroud News website on
    March 15, 2015. The case of this unknown man pertains to the rape of
    20-year old, mentally disabled girl in Ghaderabad Village of Damghan in
    2012. Arrest and detention There is no information available on the

    individual with rape. He was accused of breaking into the house of and
    raping a 20-year old, mentally disabled girl. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence of guilt entered against this unknown
    individual. Defense There is no information available on the details of
    this unknown individual s defense. Judgment The court sentenced this
    unknown man to death. This unknown individual was hanged publicly in the
    Karegar Square of Shahroud in the presence of the judiciary and police
    authorities on March 15, 2015.
