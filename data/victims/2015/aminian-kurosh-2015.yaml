    News of the execution of Mr. Kurosh Aminian was published on the website
    of Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran on January 17, 2015.
    Additional information was taken from the website of HRANA (Human Rights
    Activists News Agency) on January 15, 2015. According to the existing
    information, Mr. Aminian, 38, was a truck driver from Qasr-e Shirin. He
    was married with two children. Arrest and detention Mr. Aminian was
    detained for 4 years. On January 15, 2015, he was transferred to solitary
    confinement in the Zahedan Central Prison and lost all contacts with the
    outside world. (Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran) The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Aminian s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Aminian was announced as offences related to
    narcotics. (HRANA) The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Aminian. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Aminian s defense. Judgment Mr. Kurosh Aminian was hanged
    in the Zahedan Central Prison on January 17, 2015. According to the Human
    Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran, he had been once taken to solitary
    confinement for execution, but his execution was postponed at the last
    minute and his case was referred to the Supreme Court. However, he was
    executed before the Supreme Court issued any ruling.
