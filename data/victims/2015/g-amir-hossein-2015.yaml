    News of the execution of Mr. Amir Hossein G., along with three others, was
    published on the website of Central Provincial Courthouse on February 22,
    2015. Arrest and Detention According to the report, Mr. Amir Hossein G.
    possessed narcotics when arrested. There is no specific information about
    his arrest and detention. Trial Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Arak tried Mr. Amir Hossein G. No information is available on his
    trial. Charges According to the report, the charges against Mr. Amir
    Hossein G. were announced as "participation in producing the psychoactive
    substance methamphetamine and selling narcotics." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Amir Hossein G. was
    possession of 59 kilograms and 800 grams of methamphetamine when arrested.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Amir Hossein G.'s defense.
    Judgment Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Arak condemned
    Mr. Amir Hossein G. to death and the General Public Prosecutor s Office
    and the Head of the Judiciary confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at the
    Arak Central Prison yard on February 22, 2015 at dawn.
