# --- DEATH ---
date_of_death: 2015-11-24
age_at_death: 63
place_of_death: "Minab"
province: "Hormozgan"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Hanging"
circumstances: >
    News of the execution of an unknown Kurd, along with five others, was
    published on the websites of the Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse on
    November 30, 2015, and the Baloch Activists Campaign on November 25, 2015.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of the defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Minab
    tried this individual. No information is available on the defendant s
    trial. Charges The charge brought against the defendant was drug
    trafficking. No detailed information is available on his charge. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the Public
    Relations Office of the Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse, the defendant and
    five others participated in transporation of a total of 200 kilograms of
    heroin from the eastern border into Iran. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Minab condemned the defendant and four others to death based on
    Article 8, Section 6, and Article 30 of the Reformed Anti-Narcotics Law*
    (websites of the Hormozgan Provincial Courthouse). The First Deputy of the
    Judiciary confirmed the ruling. The defendant was hanged, along with four
    others, at the Minab Prison on Noveber 24, 2015 at dawn. This prisoner was
    able to visit his family a day before his execution. No specific
    information is available about this execution.
    ---------------------------------------- * Article 8: Whoever imports
    heroin, morphine, cocaine, and other chemicals related to morphine and
    cocaine, or attempts to make, produce, distribute, export, transport, and
    deal, or sell, possess, hide, or transport [narcotics], will be punished
    based on the amount of drug as following: Section 6: Over 30 grams [will
    be condemned to] death and confiscation of properties except cost of
    living for the convict s family. Article 30: The vehicle that carries
    narcotics will be confiscated by the state and by approval of the
    Anti-Narcotics Headquraters, will be given to the organization that
    recovered it. If transportation of narcotics took place without the
    knowledge of the owner, the vehicle will be returned to the owner. Note:
    All individuals who had participated in making or embedding places for
    transporting narcotics in any way, will be condemned as abetting if a
    crime takes place or, otherwise, to 3 to 6 months imprisonment and from 10
    to 50 millions Rials fine.
