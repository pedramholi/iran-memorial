    News of the execution of an unknown person, along with two others, was
    sent to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation by an informed source on
    January 26, 2015. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this unknown
    person s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges brought against
    this unknown person were announced as offenses related to narcotics. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant s defense. Judgment This unknown person was hanged, along
    with two others, at the Nedamatgah Markazi in Karaj on January 25, 2015.
