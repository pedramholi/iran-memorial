    News of the execution of Mr. Soleiman Ahmadnejad, son of Hossein, along
    with another person, was published on the websites of the Kurdpa news
    agency on January 21, 2015 and HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency)
    on January 25, 2015. News of the execution of Mr. Soleiman Ahmadnejad,
    along with nine others, was also published on the website of
    Nafas-dar-qafas on January 23, 2015. The official media of the Islamic
    Republic did not report this execution. Mr. Ahmadnejad was a resident of
    Amirabad in Bukan. Arrest and Detention According to the Kurdpa news
    agency, Mr. Ahmadnejad was arrested in 2011 and detained for three years.
    There is no specific information on his arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Ahmadnejad's trial. Charges According to
    the Kurdpa news agency, the charge against Mr. Ahmadnejad was announced as
    "dealing narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Ahmadnejad. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ahmadnejad's defense. Judgment The judiciary condemned
    Mr. Soleiman Ahmadnejad to death. He was hanged in the Esfahan Central
    Prison on January 21, 2015.
