    News of the execution of Mr. Issa Alizehi was announced by the website of
    the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Hormozgan Province (October
    12, 2015) as well as HRANA (April 14, 2015). This case is related to the
    murder of a person in 2011. Arrest and detention Mr. Alizehi was arrested
    after the murder of an individual, in the course of a collective quarrel,
    in September 2011. However, there is no information available on the
    details of his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Alizehi was tried by Branch
    One of the Public Court of Hormozgan Province. There is no information
    available on the details of the session or sessions of his trial. Charges
    The court charged Mr. Alizehi with murder. He was accused of stabbing a
    person to death in the course of a collective quarrel. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information available on
    the details of the evidence of guilt entered against Mr. Alizehi. Defense
    There is no information available on the details of Mr. Alizehi s defense.
    Judgment The court sentenced Mr. Alizehi to death. The verdict was
    validated by Branch 11 of the Supreme Court. After the head of the
    Judiciary had enforced the verdict, Mr. Alizehi was hanged in the
    courtyard of Bandar Abbas Central Prison on the morning of Thursday, April
    9, 2015.
