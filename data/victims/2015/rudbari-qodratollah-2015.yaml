    News of the execution of Mr. Qodratollah Rudbari, along with five others,
    was published on the website of Iran Human Rights Organization on January
    26, 2015. This website updated the number of executed individuals on
    January 27, 2015. According to this update, the execution of two
    defendants was stopped and the prisoners returned to their cells. News of

    Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on Mr. Rudbari s
    arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on Mr. Rudbari s
    trial. Charges According to the Iran Human Rights Organization report, the
    charge against Mr. Rudbari was announced as "related to narcotics." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Rudbari. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Rudbari's defense. Judgment Mr. Qodratollah Rudbari was hanged at the
    Kerman Prison yard on January 25, 2015. Before the execution, the families
    were informed and had a chance for their last visitations.
