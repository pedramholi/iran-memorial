    News of the execution of Mr. Abdorrahman Janjalzadeh, along with another
    person, was published on the website of the Human Rights Activists for
    Democracy in Iran on January 17, 2015. News of the transfer to the Zahedan
    Central Prison for execution was published on the website of HRANA (Human
    Rights Activists News Agency) on January 15, 2015. According to these
    reports, Mr. Janjalzadeh was an Afghan citizen. Arrest and Detention Mr.
    Janjalzadeh was detained in Zahedan Prison, Section Seven, for five years.
    On January 15, 2015, he was transferred to solitary confinement and all
    prison communications with the outside world ceased. There is no specific
    information on his arrest and detention. Trial No information is available
    on Mr. Janjalzadeh s trial. Charges According to HRANA, the charge against
    Mr. Janjalzadeh was announced as "related to narcotics." The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Janjalzadeh.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Janjalzadeh's defense. Judgment
    According to the existing information, Mr. Abdorrahman Janjalzadeh was
    hanged at the Zahedan Central Prison on January 17, 2015. Once before, he
    had been taken for execution but that was postponed due to his heart
    attack.
