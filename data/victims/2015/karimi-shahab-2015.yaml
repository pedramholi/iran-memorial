    Shahab Karimi spent four years of his childhood at the prison with his
    mother News of Mr. Shahab Karimi s execution was published by the IRIB
    News (April 13, 2015) and on the Alborz Province Judiciary s website
    (April 14, 2015). Additional information was obtained through the
    Boroumand Foundation s research and interviews with people with knowledge
    of the case. Based on available information, Mr. Shahab Karimi was a
    married man, born on July 19, 1988 in [the city of] Arak. In 1991, when he
    was just three years old, his father was executed in Arak on drug
    trafficking charges. He, along with his brother and sister, spent a few of
    their childhood years in [the city of] Karaj s Rajaishahr Prison with
    their mother, who had also been arrested on drug charges. Mr. Karimi quit
    school after fifth grade and started to work in an auto mechanic shop out
    of necessity in order to help out his poor family. Mr. Karimi had a prior
    record of hospitalization at Razi (Aminabad) Mental Institution and
    carried a red card (reserved for acute mental patients). Mr. Karimi s case
    is related to a collective case of drug production and distribution.
    (Boroumand Foundation research). Arrest and detention On December 15,
    2011, subsequent to an automobile chase, Mr. Karimi was arrested by
    Information Ministry forces at the Sattar Khan Street traffic light while
    he had gotten out of the car and was hiding. Several of Mr. Karimi s
    co-defendants were arrested that same day in several different locations.
    He was alone in his car when security forces gave him chase. Mr. Karimi
    was detained at the Karaj Information Administration for a month and a
    half where he underwent interrogations, was subsequently transferred to
    Qezelhessar Prison on January 29, 2012, and after a short while, to Karaj
    Central Prison where he spent more than three years. A few months after
    his arrest, Mr. Karimi got married over the phone by giving power of
    attorney to his mother, and had in person visitations with his wife for
    one hour a month for a year and a half. During that period, he had cabin
    visitations once a week for 15 minutes with the rest of his family.
    (Boroumand Foundation research). Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Karimi s trial, but based on available information, his case was
    adjudicated by Karaj District One General and Revolutionary Court Branch
    13 in several sessions and in the presence of his attorney. Mr. Shahab
    Karimi and his co-defendants last trial session took place on October 31,
    2012, and was presided over by judge Seyyed Mussa Assefalhosseini.
    (Boroumand Foundation research). Charges Mr. Karimi was charged with
    complicity in the manufacture and production of 6 kilograms of
    psychotropic substances, namely methamphetamines. (Boroumand Foundation
    research). The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt Based on available information, the amount
    of around 6 kilograms of meth that was recovered from two of Mr. Shahab
    Karimi s co-defendants at the time of their arrest was also used against
    Mr. Karimi as evidence of the crime. Mr. Karimi was not carrying drugs or
    anything else [that could be considered] evidence of a crime at the time
    of his arrest. (Boroumand Foundation research). Defense Mr. Karimi stated
    in his own defense that he was a simple worker and had only worked for
    three months at the drugs production shop, and that the drugs produced did
    not belong to him. Documents pertaining to Mr. Karimi s mental illness,
    consisting of the dates of his hospitalization at the Razi (Aminabad)
    Mental Institution from May 22, 2007, to June 28, 2007, as well as his red
    card, were submitted to the Court for its consideration. The Court did not
    pay any attention thereto, however, and did not send him to be examined by
    the Medical Examiner, simply contenting itself with a single question and
    answer with the defendant. Mr. Karimi s attorney was present at the trial
    sessions but the details of his defense of his client are not available.
    (Boroumand Foundation research). Judgment On October 31, 2012, the judge
    sentenced Mr. Shahab Karimi to death. His attorney appealed the sentence;
    the sentence was, however, upheld at the appellate stage. Mr. Karimi s
    sentence was carried out on April 13, 2015, and he was executed along with
    eight other individuals, including three of his co-defendants. (IRIB News,
    April 13, 2015), (Alborz Province Judiciary s website, April 14, 2015). An
    eyewitness, who had counted the bodies, declared the number of individuals
    executed that day to be 11, one of whom was Mr. Shahab Karimi. Mr. Karimi
    s body was turned over to his family for burial; he was interred at [the
    town of] Malard s Emamzadeh Ebrahim s Behesht-e Golzar Cemetery, Section
    2, Row 17. (Boroumand Foundation research). Mr. Karimi had an in person
    visitation with his wife two days prior to the implementation of the
    sentence. He visited with the rest of
