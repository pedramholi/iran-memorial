    News of the execution of Mr. Jihand Rigi was published on the websites of
    the Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran on February 4, 2015 and
    Baluchcampaign (Baluch Activists) on March 2, 2015. Additional information
    was taken from the website of the Human Rights and Democracy Activists in
    Iran on March 23 and September 7, 2013, and February 13 and November 3,
    2014. Mr. Rigi, 27, was a Baluch political activist. Arrest and detention
    Mr. Rigi was arrested by security agents and transferred to the Zahedan
    Intelligence Office prison in 2010. (Human Rights and Democracy Activists
    in Iran, September 7, 2013) He was detained in solitary confinement and
    tortured physically and psychologically by the interrogators of the
    Intelligence Ministry for several months. After receiving his sentence, he
    was transferred to the Public Section of the Zahedan Central Prison.
    During his detention, he objected to the prison conditions several times.
    Once he resisted wearing a worn woman s dress full of lice and was
    transferred to solitary confinement where he was tortured. According to
    the Baluchcampaign website, before his execution Mr. Rigi spent some times
    in the Chahbahar Prison in exile. Overall, he was detained for four years
    without an attorney. Trial Branch One of the Revolutionary Court of
    Zahedan tried Mr. Rigi in a few minutes session. (Human Rights and
    Democracy Activists in Iran on February 4, 2015) Charges No information is
    available on Mr. Rigi s charges. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against Mr. Rigi. However, according to the reports, the
    interrogators of the Intelligence Ministry tortured and forced him to
    confess against his will. (Human Rights and Democracy Activists in Iran)
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. In the case of political detainees, these confessions are,
    at times, televised. National television broadcasts confessions during
    which prisoners plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and
    renounce their political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights
    organizations have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by
    those prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available about
    Mr. Rigi s defense. Judgment Branch One of the Revolutionary Court of
    Zahedan condemned Mr. Jihand Rigi to death and 10 years imprisonment. He
    was hanged in the presence of the Public Prosecutor of Zahedan, the Head
    of Branch One of the Revolutionary Court of Zahedan, and his interrogator,
    at the Zahedan Central Prison on February 4, 2015 at dawn.
