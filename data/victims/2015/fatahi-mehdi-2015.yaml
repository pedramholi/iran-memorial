    News of the execution of Mr. Mehdi Fatahi was published on the websites of
    HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on February 25, and Khorasan
    newspaper on February 26, 2015. According to the existing reports, he was
    born in Torbat-e Heydarieh. Arrest and Detention According to HRANA, Mr.
    Fatahi was arrested and transferred to the Tabas Central Prison in 2011.
    According to the Khorasan newspaper, quoting an informed source, he was
    arrested for the second time. However, there is no specific information on
    his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Fatahi was tried in Tabas. However, no
    information is available on his trial. Charges According to HRANA, the
    charge against Mr. Fatahi was "dealing narcotics." The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Fatahi was having
    multiple records related to dealing narcotics. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Fatahi's defense. Judgment The Tabas Court had condemned
    Mr. Mehdi Fatahi to 15 years imprisonment; however, after his appeal, the
    sentence was increased to death. After the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling, he was hanged in the presence of the judicial and security
    officials at the Tabas Prison yard on February 25, 2015 at dawn.
