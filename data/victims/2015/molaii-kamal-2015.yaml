    Mr. Mola'i was a mechanic. He had lost his father when he was child. News
    of Mr. Kamal Molaii s execution along with five other individuals, was
    published by various sources including Kalemeh TV (March 4, 2015), HRANA
    (March 4, 2015), and Deutsche Welle Radio (March 4, 2015). The Judiciary
    Branch news agency (Mizan Online, March 4, 2015) also announced the news
    of the execution of six individuals in Rajai Shahr Prison, without stating
    their names. Additional information was obtained through an interview
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with Mr. Hamed Ahmadi,
    the spokesman for Rajai Shahr Prison Sunni prisoners (ABF Interview) in
    the weeks leading to the execution, prisoners video messages and audio
    interviews with television networks and other media from inside prison,
    including video messages recorded by Mr. Molaii, and other sources*. Mr.
    Molaii was single, and was a Suni Kurd residingin [the city of] Sanandaj.
    He had a middle school education and was a mechanic. He had lost his
    father when he was child. Mr. Molaii was a religious man and believed and
    practiced the Shafe i** [branch of Islam]. Among his religious activities
    were participating in his neighborhood mosque in Sanandaj, and
    distributing religious CD s and printed materials. According to his prison
    mate, he was a forgiving and pleasant man who was engaged in [spiritual]
    purification and religious studies in prison, and in media activities
    dealing with prisoners news. In addition to physical exercise, cooking,
    and helping newly arrived prisoners, he made handicraft, including dolls
    for prisoners children. (ABF Interview) Mr. Molaii did not belong to any
    group or organization. He and the other Sunni prisoners sentenced to death
    were proselytizing the Shafe i religion, and according to themselves, were
    trying to prevent people from being taken advantage of in the name of
    religion. (Center for Supporters of Human Rights, May 4, 2014) Background
    Based on existing information, in the years 2007 to 2009-10, numerous
    insults were made by promoters of the Shi a religion against Sunni beliefs
    and individuals who commanded their respect, causing the reaction of Sunni
    religious personalities and activists. Following offensive remarks made by
    Ebrahim Hatamikia (famous Shi a film director) against Aisha (the Prophet
    Mohammad s wife) in an interview with Khanevadeh Sabz Magazine (Volume
    195, 2007), and statements made by well-known preachers including
    Hojjatoleslam Daneshmand, Hojjatoleslam Juybari, and Hojjatoleslam Ansari
    whose lectures were at times covered by state-run radio and television a
    number of religious Sunni youth from Kurdistan considered these insults to
    have been organized [by the state]. They started religious classes,
    distributing CD s and books in local mosques, universities, and their
    neighborhoods, and protested these actions, shedding light on [the
    motives], promoting and defending the principles of the Shafe i religion.
    These CD s included documented cases offensive to Sunni beliefs, quoting
    religious authoritative and reputable sources such as Bihar al-Anwar.
    These young people s religious activities aroused the security apparatus
    suspicions. Subsequent to Ayatollah Khamenei s trip to Sanandaj in May
    2009, a number of young Sunni Kurd religious activists were arrested in
    the name of the fight against Salafi and heretic movements. Three months
    after these arrests, [a number of] assassinations were carried out in
    Sanandaj, including those of Mamusta Shiekholeslam, member of the Assembly
    of Experts, and Molla Borjhan Aali, a Sunni cleric. The security forces
    accused individuals that had already been arrested prior theses
    assassinations. Although the charge of assassination was not brought up in
    court and the arrestees were tried for Moharebeh, the charge was,
    nevertheless, constantly mentioned on news media and by judicial and
    security officials. The defendants denied any and all relations with
    armed, radical, and extremist groups, objected to the charges brought
    against them and demanded an open re-trial, to which they got no response.
    Ultimately, six of the detainees were executed in January 2013 and another
    six on March 4, 2015. The issuance and implementation of the death
    sentence against this group of Sunni defendants caused much reaction by
    individuals and domestic and international institutions. In June 2014, 19
    human rights organizations objected to the sentences and demanded that
    they be revoked. Additionally, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch,
    the Center for Human Rights Defenders, and the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation issuing bulletins and a number of calls to action, demanded the
    revocation of the defendants death sentence and a fair, transparent, an
    open trial. Sunni religious personalities, including Molavi Abdolhamid,
    [city of] Zahedan Friday Prayer Imam, Hassan Amini, Sanandaj s Imam
    Bokhara Seminary s mufti and director, and Molana Gergij [city of]
    Azadshahr Friday Prayer Imam, wrote open lette
