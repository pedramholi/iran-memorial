    Salar Mahmudzadeh, son of Salim, was submitted to the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center through electronic form on March 31, 2019, by one of his
    acquaintances. Furthermore, news of this and 10 other executions was
    published on the Human Rights Activists in Iran, HRANA website (June 11,
    2015) and the Iran Human Rights Organization website (June 16, 2015).
    Additional information regarding this case was obtained from Iran Tribune
    website (May 28, 2015) and Iran Human Rights Organization (June 6, 2018).
    News of this execution has not been published and disseminated by the
    country s official media. Mr. Mahmudzadeh was born in a low income family
    on June 29, 1988, in Shahr-e Rey, a city to the south of Tehran. He was
    married and worked in the private sector. His father was executed on drug
    related charges when Mr. Mahmudzadeh was still a child. He was forced to
    drop out of school and start working at the age of 10. (Electronic form).
    Mr. Mahmudzadeh s case is related to drug related crimes committed in
    Shahr-e Rey in 2014-15. Arrest and detention One day in early 2014, Mr.
    Mahmudzadeh was arrested at 7 o clock in the morning in Shahr-e Rey by the
    city s Narcotics Administration agents. Mr. Mahmydzadeh spent some time in
    the Shahr-e Rey Narcotics Administration s detention center, and was
    subsequently transferred to Qezelhessar Prison s Hall One, Unit 2. He was
    allowed weekly visitations with his family during the more than one year
    he spent in detention. (Electronic form). On the morning of June 6, 2015,

    located on Shariati Avenue tried Mr. Mahmudzadeh. The first trial session
    convened in the summer of 2014, with his attorney in attendance.

    There is, however, no information available regarding the details of this
    and other court sessions in the case. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Mahmudzadeh was transportation of narcotic drugs . (Electronic form).
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of prescribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence used against
    Mr. Mahmudzadeh was 1,800 grams of methamphetamines and the testimony of
    the Headquarters for the Fight against Narcotic Drugs agents . (Electronic
    form). Defense There is no information regarding the defense presented by
    Mr. Mahmudzadeh and his attorney in the case. (Electronic form). Judgment
    Tehran Islamic Revolutionary Court sentenced Mr. Salar Mahmudzadeh to
    death. The appeal was denied and the lower court ruling was upheld.
    According to the statements by one of Mr. Salar Mahmudzadeh s
    acquaintances, beginning on June 10, 2015, he was taken to the gallows
    numerous times for an entire week before he was ultimately hanged on the
    seventh day at [the city of] Karaj s Qezelhessar Prison, located in Alborz
    Province (Electronic form), whereas the media announced Mr. Mahmudzadeh
    and ten other individuals execution on June 10, 2015. (HRANA, Iran Human
    Right Organization). During their last visitation, Mr. Mahmudzadeh s
    family was under the impression that he was going to be transferred to
    another prison. (Electronic form).
