    News of the execution of an unknown woman, along with twelve others, was
    published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on
    January 2, 2015. According to this report, the official media in Iran did
    not report these executions. Arrest and detention The circumstances of the
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charge brought against the
    defendant was announced as offences related to narcotics. (HRANA) The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the
    defendant s defense. Judgment This female defendant was hanged, along with
    three other women, in Bam Prison on January 1, 2015.
