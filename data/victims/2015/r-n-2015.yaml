    News of the execution of Mr. N. R., along with another person, was
    published on the website of the Mazandaran Provincial Courthouse on May
    31, 2015. Arrest and detention According to the report, Mr. N. R. had been
    imprisoned for narcotics. He was on leave from the prison when rearrested
    in possession of narcotics. The circumstances of his arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. N. R. s trial.
    Charges According to the Public Relations Office of the Mazandaran
    Provincial Courthouse, quoting the General Public Prosecutor of Mazandarn,
    the charge brought against Mr. N. R. was announced as transportation of 29
    kilograms and 320 grams of opium. During his first trial, he had been
    charged with transportation of 24 kilograms of opium. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. N. R. was having a
    criminal record. Defense No information is available on Mr. N. R. s
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. N. R. to death and he was hanged
    in the presence of the General Public Prosecutor of Mazandarn at the Sari
    Prison yard on May 31, 2015. Twice the Pardon Committee of the Judiciary
    denied his pardon request.
