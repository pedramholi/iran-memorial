    News of the execution of Mr. Lazem Purrashidi was published on the
    websites of Kurdpa, the Kurdistan Press Agency, on February 8, 2015. Mr.
    Purrashidi, 20, was a Kurdish from the Haluvan Village in Siluvaneh
    District near Orumieh. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Purrashidi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Purrashidi s trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Purrashidi was announced as drug trafficking. No specific information
    is available on his charge. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against Mr. Purrashidi. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Purrashidi s defense. Judgment Mr. Lazem
    Purrashidi was hanged in the Shahab Prison in Kerman on February 7, 2015
    at dawn. No specific information is available about this execution.
