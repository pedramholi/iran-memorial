    News of the execution of Mr. Farshad Ja fari was published on the website
    of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on March 16, 2015. Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of Mr. Ja fari s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shiraz tried Mr. Ja
    fari. No information is available on his trial. Charges According to
    HRANA, the charge brought against Mr. Ja fari was announced as crimes
    related to narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Ja fari. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Ja fari s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Shiraz condemned Mr. Farshad Ja fari to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at the Adelabad Prison yard in Shiraz
    on March 15, 2015.
