    News of the execution of Mr. Samad Zahabi along with one other person was
    published by Radio Farda (October 16 and 20, 2015,) the Human Rights
    Activists News Agency (October 19 and 22, 2015,) and Amnesty International
    (October 14, 2015.) Additional information was taken from an interview
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation with a person close to
    Zahabi on June 24, 2016. Mr. Zahabi was born in Karambast Village in
    Kermanshah and attended primary school there. However, due to financial
    difficulties, he had to leave school and start work alongside his father
    tending livestock on a farm. He was a quiet and shy boy who loved
    wrestling. His case was related to the killing of a young man who
    accompanied him to check sheep in the mountains around his village in the
    fall of 2011. He was 17 at the time of the incident. In a statement
    published on October 9, 2015, United Nations human rights officials
    condemned the execution of Mr. Zahabi and another juvenile and demanded
    that the Iranian government halt executions generally, especially in cases
    of defendants being tried for crimes allegedly committed under the age of
    18. The Secretary General of the UN expressed regret about the execution
    of these two juveniles. In addition, the Special Rapporteur on the
    situation of human rights in Iran made reference to the executions as a
    painful example of the increase in capital punishment in Iran. Amnesty
    International also objected to the execution of these two individuals in a
    statement published on October 14, 2015. International laws strictly
    prohibit capital punishment against those under the age of 18 at the time
    of committing a crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran is bound to
    abstain from capital punishment in the cases of such juvenile offenders.
    Arrest and detention When officers from the local police station went to
    his village a day after the incident, Mr. Zahabi surrendered himself. He
    was first taken to the station and then to the Intelligence Police Office
    in Kermanshah. Because of his age, he was later transferred to the
    Rehabilitation and Correction Center in Kermanshah where he was detained
    for two years. After his eighteenth birthday, he was transferred to
    Dizelabad Prison in Kermanshah where he was detained for another two
    years. He had weekly visitations on Tuesdays, mostly in a booth behind
    glass panels and only rarely in-person. However, his visitations in the
    Rehabilitation and Correction Center were conducted in-person and on a
    weekly basis. His last visitation took place a week before his execution.
    (ABF interview) Trial The Criminal Court of Kermanshah tried Mr. Zahabi.
    However, no information is available concerning his trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Zahabi was announced as murder. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    The evidence presented against Mr. Zahabi was his confession, the
    testimony of several villagers, recovery of the victim s body, and the
    reconstruction of the crime scene. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Zahabi was
    younger than 18 at the time of the incident. His family had to use a
    public defender due to financial difficulties; they chose an attorney for
    themselves after the time of trial, however. During his defense, Mr.
    Zahabi stated that the shooting was accidental and he did not intend to
    kill the victim. He claimed that during the course of a fight, the full
    load of a shotgun shell struck the victim s chest owing to the close
    proximity of Zahabi and the victim. Afterwards, Mr. Zahabi voluntarily
    surrendered himself to the police. He had taken the gun with him to the
    mountain to protect his sheep from wolves (most shepherds arm themselves
    for the same reason.) After his objection to the ruling, his case was
    referred to the Appeals Court. A Summary of the Legal Defects in Mr. Samad
    Zahabi s Case In this case, Mr. Zahabi and the victim were friends. They
    worked together herding sheep. There were no issues between them or their
    respective families. Immediately after the incident, Mr. Zahabi recounted
    the event to several of the villagers and ultimately surrendered himself
    the next day and told of what had happened. There is no premeditation or
    prior intent in this case and it is clear that the murder had taken place
    following an argument and in the heat of the moment. According to the
    statements of individuals close to him, Mr. Zahabi had no intention of
    shooting and the murder was an accident. According to Iranian law, a
    murder is considered intentional when the murderer either intends t
