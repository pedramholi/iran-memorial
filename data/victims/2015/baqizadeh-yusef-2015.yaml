    News of the execution of Mr. Yusef Baqizadeh was published on the website
    of Kurdpa, Kurdistan Press Agency, on August 29, 2015. Mr. Baqizadeh, 56,
    was a Kurdish citizen from the Amirabad Village near Oshnavieh in
    Azarbaijan-e Gharbi. He Had been condemned for dealing narcotics in 2004,
    and was detained for 7 years in prison. Arrest and detention Mr. Baqizadeh
    was arrested in 2012. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Baqizadeh s trial.
    Charges The charge brought against Mr. Baqizadeh was dealing narcotics. No
    detailed information is available on his charge. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Baqizadeh. He had
    been previously detained for 7 years for narcotics related charges.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Baqizadeh s defense. Judgment
    Mr. Yusef Baqizadeh was hanged at the Khorramabad Central Prison on August
    29, 2015. No specific information is available about his execution.
