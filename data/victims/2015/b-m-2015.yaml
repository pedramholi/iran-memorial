circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. M. B., along with another person, was
    published on the website of Gilan Provincial Courthouse, quoting the
    Public Relations Office of this courthouse on February 14, 2015. Mr. M.
    B., son of Khosro, was born in Gilan. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on Mr. M. B. s arrest and detention. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. M. B. s trial. Charges The charges against
    Mr. M. B. were announced as "having a criminal record, stewardship in
    transportation and possession of 15 kilograms of opium and 4 kilograms and
    860 grams of heroin." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. M. B. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. M. B.'s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. M. B.
    to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. Twice the Amnesty and
    Pardon Commission denied the defendant s pardon request. He was hanged in
    the Rasht Central Prison on February 14, 2015.
