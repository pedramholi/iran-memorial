    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Karim Moradzehi, along with five
    others, was published on the website of Iran Human Rights Organization on
    January 26, 2015. This website updated the number of executed individuals
    on January 27, 2015. According to this update, the execution of two
    defendants was stopped and the prisoners returned to their cells. News of
    this execution was not reflected in the official media in Kerman province.
    However, the families were informed and had a chance for their last
    visitations. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on Mr.
    Moradzehi s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    Moradzehi s trial. Charges According to the Iran Human Rights Organization
    report, the charge against Mr. Moradzehi was announced as "related to
    narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Moradzehi. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Moradzehi's defense. Judgment Mr. Mohammad Karim Moradzehi was hanged
    at the Kerman Prison yard on January 25, 2015.
