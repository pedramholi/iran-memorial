    News of the execution of Mr. Zaher Omredin, son of Abdolnazer, along with
    nine others not named, was published on the website of the Hormozgan
    General Courthouse, quoting the Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan
    General Courthouse, and on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists
    News Agency) with full names on August 17, 2015. Mr. Omredin was an Afghan
    citizen. His brother was among the executed individuals. Arrest and
    detention According to HRANA, Mr. Omredin was detained for six years;
    however, the circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial According to the website of the Hormozgan General Courthouse, Branch
    Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Bandar-e Abbas tried Mr.
    Omredin. However, no information is available on his trial. Charges
    According to the Public Relations Office of the Hormozgan General
    Courthouse, the charge brought against Mr. Omredin was announced as drug
    trafficking. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Omredin. However, according to the Public Relations
    Office of the Hormozgan General Courthouse, these ten executed drug
    traffickers in Minab and Bandar-e Abbas had been charged with possession,
    transportation, and selling over 398 kilograms of narcotics including 70
    kilograms of heroin, 200 kilograms of opium, 105 kilograms of crack, 4
    kilograms of hashish, and 19 grams of morphine across the Hormozgan
    Province and the neighboring provinces. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Omredin s defense. Judgment Branch Two of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Bandar-e Abbas condemned Mr. Vazir Ahmad Omredin to
    death. After the General Public Prosecutor confirmed the ruling, it was
    carried out on Monday August 17, 2015 and Mr. Omredin was hanged, along
    with five others, at the Bandar-e Abbas Central Prison yard at six a.m.
