    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Barsalamat, along with three others, was
    published on the website of HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) on
    February 28, 2015. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Barsalamat s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Barsalamat s trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Barsalamat was announced as related to narcotics. No information is
    available on the details of this charge. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Barsalamat.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Barsalamat s defense. Judgment
    Mr. Ali Barsalamat was hanged, along with three others, in Kerman Prison
    on February 26, 2015. There is no information on the details of this
    execution.
