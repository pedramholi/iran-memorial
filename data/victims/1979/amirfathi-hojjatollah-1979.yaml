    Major Hojjatollah Amirfathi is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13,
    1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. Further information regarding Major Amirfathi s execution
    was sent to Omid via an electronic form by a person familiar with this
    case. Arrest and detention According to the electronic form, Major
    Amirfathi was arrested by the Tehran Committee on April 13, 1979 at 10 am.
    He was taken to Qasr Prison for one day before being transferred to the
    Revolutionary Committee of Ardebil. He detained for two days during which
    he had a short visit with his family. Trial Based on the available
    information on the form, Major Amirfathi was tried at Ardebil s former
    police headquarters on April 14, 1979. His trial reportedly lasted 5 hours
    and he was denied an attorney. Charges The charges against Major
    Amirfathi, as listed in the Amnesty International report, are: corruption
    on earth, war on God, mass murder, destroying property, illegal entry into
    people s houses, as well as armed attack and/or attacking people s homes.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have executed
    individuals on trumped up-charges such as drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the form,
    the evidence used against Major Amirfathi was the complaints against him
    by some former members of the SAVAK [former regime s political police]. On
    the form it is mentioned that the witnesses against the defendant were
    ill-intentioned and accused him of charges for which they did not have
    sufficient evidence. Defense No information is available on his defense
    except that he had no legal representation. Judgment Mr. Hojjatollah
    Amirfathi was sentenced to death and executed on April 15, 1979 at the
    Ardebil Committee. No further information is available regarding this
    defendant s sentencing.
