    General Reza Naji is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty
    International report. The report lists defendants who were convicted by
    Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception until 12 August
    1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from sources including
    translations of indictments, reports of trials carried out by local and
    foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News Agency reports.
    The execution of General Reza Naji and three other former regime officials
    was also reported in the Ayandegan daily (February 17, 1979). The news was
    followed by a communiqu of the Extraordinary Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal regarding the case. General Naji is also one of 10 convicts
    mentioned in the Memoirs of Sadeq Khalkhali ( Isolation Time , Vol. 1,
    p.352), the first post-revolution Shari'a judge and head of the Islamic
    Revolutionary tribunal. Arrest and detention Based on the communiqu , the
    defendant was arrested by Islamic armed forces. The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention remain unknown. Trial The Ayandegan report mentioned
    that the Extraordinary Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal held a session at
    Alavi High School # 2 [Refah], which lasted for 10 hours. Based on the
    report, this Extraordinary Tribunal was ordered to form two days before it
    took session at the high school. General Naji and the other defendants
    were said to be the first group of "criminals" tried after the victory of
    the Revolution four days earlier. The details and conditions of the
    tribunal remain unknown. However the Shari'a judge mentions this trial in
    his Memoirs: "I began to try the convicts soon after my nomination. The
    first people I tried and punished for their deeds were Nematollah Nasiri,
    head of SAVAK, and Khosrowdad, air forcer commander; Naji, martial law
    administrator of Esfahan, and Rahimi, martial law administrator of Tehran
    and head of police force... I believed at the time, and I still believe,
    that all the parliamentarians and senators, all governors, heads of SAVAK
    and police, who held office after 1963 and the Imam's boycott, should be
    sentenced to death. High-ranking ministery officials who were instrumental
    in the survival of the apparatus [Shah s regime] and who, for getting
    close to the Shah and his family, would accept any humiliation are all
    guilty... " Charges The communiqu of the Extraordinary Revolutionary
    Tribunal did not specify General Naji s charges. Collectively, the four
    defendants were charged with torture and massacre of the people as well as
    being traitors to the country. The Shari'a judge, Sadeq Khalkhali,
    elaborates on the defendent's charges in his memoirs: "All the people who
    were sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Tribunals were the best
    examples of corruptor on earth and they were executed as such... A
    Corruptor on earth is a person who contributes to spreading and expanding
    corruption on earth. Corruption is what leads to the decline, destruction
    and the deviation of society from its nature. People who were executed had
    strived in spreading corruption and prostitution, circulating heroin,
    opium and licencious behavior, atheism, murder, betrayal, flattery, and,
    in sum, all these vile qualities. These people s problems were aggravated
    by the fact that they did not repent once they saw the people s
    revolution." Evidence of guilt No information is available regarding the
    evidence presented against this defendant. The report of the trial
    mentioned the presence of witnesses testifying in support of the
    prosecutors but provides no information regarding their testimony. Based
    on the statements of the presiding judge regarding this execution
    [published in Sadeq Khalkhali's memoirs, Volume I], the defendant's
    association with the former regime after the year 1963 was also regarded
    as incriminating evidence against him: "I believed at the time, and I
    still believe, that all the deputies and senators, all governors, heads of
    SAVAK [former regime's political police] and police, who after 1963, and
    the Imam's boycott [referring to the period starting with Ayatollah
    Khomeini's arrest and conviction following the 1963 protests against the
    Shah's social and political reforms], held office are all sentenced to
    death. Directors in ministries who were instrumental in the survival of
    the apparatus [Shah s regime] and who, for getting close to the Shah and
    his family would accept any humiliation, are all guilty." Defense There is
    no information available on General Naji's defense.Kayhan's report of the
    trial, which did not mention any statement by the defendant or the other
    officials tried that day, noted that the accused were "bombarded with
    thousands of questions." There were no defense witnesses and no defense
    lawyers. Judgment The Extraordinary Tribunal found General Naji guilty of
    corruption on earth and sentenced him to death and confiscation of his
    belongings, based on Islamic rules and regulations. After reaching this
    verdict through the majority vote, the Cou
