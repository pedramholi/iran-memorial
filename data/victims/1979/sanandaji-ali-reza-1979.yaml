    The information about Mr. Ali Reza Sanandaji, son of Ebrahim, has been
    drawn from an interview with a relative. His execution was announced in
    the Enqelab Eslami and Kayhan newspapers on September 15, 1979. Having
    finished elementary school, Mr. Sanandaji enrolled in English College of
    Esfahan. After two and half years, before finishing school, he went back
    to Sanandaj when his father had a stroke. Known as Vali Khan, Mr.
    Sanandaji was a land-owner and he raised farm animals. He was married and
    had three children. The interviewee remembers him as modern man, with good
    taste and was well-dressed. After the Revolution, his lands were de facto
    confiscated by local revolutionary and political activists without a court
    order. He appealed to the court for the return of his property. Arrest and
    detention According to the available information, in the evening of August
    26, 1979, Revolutionary Guards went to the house of a relative of Mr.
    Sanandaji where he was arrested. The guards told his family members that
    they would soon bring him back. From the time of his arrest until
    execution, he was in custody for only a few hours. Trial There is no
    detailed information regarding his trial other than that Mr. Sanandaji and
    some other individuals were tried by an infamous religious judge named
    Sadeq Khalkhali at the Sanandaj airport. (Eleven men were condemned to
    death at this trial and immediately executed.) Charges In Kayhan the
    charges brought against Mr. Sanandaji were as follows: “close affiliation
    with the previous corrupt regime, abuse of this affiliation against the
    farmers of Alek village, which led to some farmers’ blindness and
    deafness, and forceful rape of a village women, and therefore, adultery.”
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, and for sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not mention evidence used against
    him at the trial. According to the interviewee, a few months after the
    execution of Mr. Sanandaji, the national broadcasting company showed a
    documentary film of his house. The film depicted the pool in the yard and
    the bathtub inside the house, as well as some bottle of alcoholic
    beverages. The film also showed metal cuffs of hobbles used in the stable
    of the house to tie the feet of unruly horses and other farm animals. The
    commentary in the film referred to the hobbles as torture instruments used
    on farmers who worked for him. Defense No information is available
    concerning Mr. Sanandaji’s defense at the trial. He was denied the right
    to have an attorney. According to the interviewee, after a trip to
    Britain, Mr. Sanandaji returned to Sanandaj despite the warnings of family
    and friends against going back to the city and appealing to the court in
    order to take back his land. He was not concerned for his own safety upon
    return and believed he had committed no crime to be afraid of his safety.
    Based on the testimony of some farmers as well as his own knowledge of Mr.
    Sanandaji, the interviewee refuted the charges of rape. The interviewee
    states that after Mr. Sanadaji was tried and condemned to death, he was
    brought to Alek village (in Kordestan Province). At the place of his
    execution, some state officials asked a few women from the village, who
    had gathered at the location, to testify that he had raped them. Under
    duress and right before Mr. Sanandaji was shot by firing squad, the women
    testified to this offence. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Sanandaj called Mr. Sanandaji a “corruptor on earth” and condemned him to
    death. He was flown by a helicopter from Sanandaj airport to Alek village.
    Meanwhile, other officials went to the village and called farmers to
    gather at the place of the execution, where Mr. Sanandaji was shot by
    firing squad on August 27, 1979. All of his property was confiscated.
    State officials returned his body to Sanandaj where family members buried
    him at the city cemetery.
