    1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until August 12, 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News

    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No

    Jaffari Nia. Defense No information is available regarding the defense of
