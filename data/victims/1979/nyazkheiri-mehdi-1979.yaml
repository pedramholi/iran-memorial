    The execution of Mr. Mehdi Nyazkheiri and three others was reported by the
    correspondent of the Pars News Agency in Kermanshah and published in the
    Enqelab Eslami daily (October 6, 1979). The Kermanshah correspondent of
    the Kayhan daily also reported the news, quoting the communiqué of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kermanshah regarding the case (October
    6, 1979). The communiqué reads as follows: "Now that the magnificent
    revolution of the Muslim people of Iran and the firm and uncompromising
    leadership of Imam Khomeini have destroyed the palace of Arrogance in this
    land, everybody is expecting that their wishes for achieving Islamic
    brotherhood and equality, living freely in a God-fearing society, and
    uprooting corruption and corruptors will come true. It is towards such a
    goal that the sword of Islamic Justice has come out of the sleeve of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals and everyday enemies of God and the People
    and violators of people's lives, livelihoods, and honor fall off on the
    lowest grounds of degradation and the society is cleansed from the stain
    of their filthy existence." Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr. Nyazkheiri was charged
    with “having a long record in robbery, rape, drug trafficking, deluding
    youngsters, and repeated acts of sodomy.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment Mr. Nyazkheiri was sentenced to death.
    The sentence was carried out the same evening, at 9:30 p.m.
