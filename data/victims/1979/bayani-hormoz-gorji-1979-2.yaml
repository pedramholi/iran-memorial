    The execution of Mr. Hormoz Gorji Bayani, son of Hossein, was announced in
    the Kayhan newspaper on August 19, 1979. Additional information about this
    case has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from two electronic
    forms sent to Omid by individuals close to him, the book Sahifeh-ye Emam
    by Ayatollah Khomeini, the book Ayam-e Enzava (Times of Solitude) by
    Ayatollah Khalkhali, the Kayhan newspaper (Aug. 23, and Sep. 25, 1979),
    the report The Demise of Sadeq Khalkhali by Mansur Boluri (Iranian
    Political Bulletin, Nov. 30, 2003), and the report Murder at Mykonos
    published by the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center. Mr. Gorji Bayani
    was born in Kermanshah in 1945. He held a bachelor s degree in physics and
    taught in a high school. He sympathized with the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization. Before and after the revolution, he delivered speeches about
    political and cultural activism and organized such activities in which
    students and teachers partook. He was a husband and a father. At the time
    of his execution, his two children were at the ages of 4 and 1 (electronic
    forms). Mr. Gorji Bayani s execution was part of a wave of executions that
    took place in order to combat the anti-Revolutionary elements in the
    Kordestan region. Following the negotiations between the Kordish
    Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI) and the interim prime minister, several
    clashes occurred, at times armed, between the Revolutionary Guards and the
    peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI) particularly in the cities of Sanandaj
    (Kordestan province) and Paveh (Kermanshah province). These intensifying
    conflicts between the new central Shiite government of Iran and the mainly
    Sunni region of Kordestan concerned the role of minorities in the drafting
    of the constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state
    religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region. Subsequent to
    conflicts that resulted in some casualties, on August 18, 1979, Ayatollah
    Khomeini issued an order to the military and the armed forces to move to
    Paveh and end the fighting In the same order, he encouraged them to use
    force and threatened that: if they do not move toward Paveh within 24
    hours with missiles and tanks and all necessary arsenals, I will hold them
    accountable. And in case of any infringement of this order, I will treat
    them in a Revolutionary manner. On August 19, Ayatollah Khomeini called
    the PDKI the party of Satan and declared it unofficial and illegal noting
    that some of these anti-Islamic individuals had boycotted the referendum
    of April 1, when people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic
    regime. In accordance with Khomeini s order, Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali
    traveled the western region of Iran and told a reporter from the Ettela at
    newspaper: I will visit all areas of Kordestan and will bring to justice
    anybody who was involved in these bloody plots. According to Mr. Boluri,
    Ayatollah Khalkhali condemned at least 58 Kords to death in the span of 10
    days. Mass executions and conflicts continued for many months in that
    region. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired
    by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America,
    was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and
    was active mainly in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Gorji Bayani was arrested in his house around noon on
    August 18, 1979 in order to give answers to a few questions for a short
    time, and taken to the Revolutionary Committee in his home clothes. During
    his detention, which lasted about 14 hours, he was held incommunicado. The
    11 co-defendants were arrested by the Revolutionary Guards. According to
    statements of the religious judge in Kermanshah Province, it appears that
    authorities prohibited the families from visiting the prisoners: I request
    the families to look after their children and watch for any
    anti-Revolutionary behavior or activity. [I also ask them] not to follow
    up with the cases of their children and let the Revolutionary Tribunals
    carry out their functions ( Kayhan , Aug. 23, 1979). Trial The newspaper
    report of the execution does not refer to a trial and only mentions the
    interrogation of defendants and testimony of witnesses. The Gorji Bayani
    family was unaware of a trial, if there was one. In an interview dated
    August 23, the religious judge of Kermanshah denied the rumors of
    execution of leftists without trial. In another interview about the recent
    executions in the region he stated: the proceedings were carried with
    outmost attention and careful investigation. The court has never acted
    outside the Islamic criteria since the court is not only responsible
    before the people, but it is also accountable before God It is true that
    the trial had
