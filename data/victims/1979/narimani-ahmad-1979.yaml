circumstances: >
    The information regarding Mr. Ahmad Narimani’s execution along with 6
    others was drawn from Kayhan Daily on 22 December 1979. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Narimani’s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial The Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashhad tried Mr. Narimani.
    Charges Kayhan Daily reported Mr. Narimani’s charges as “raping his close
    relatives”. Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against the defandant. Defense No information is
    available concerning Mr. Naser’s defense and it is not clear if he had the
    opportunity to defend himself effectively, for example whether he had
    access to a lawyer or the possibility to summon witnesses in his favor,
    etc. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Judgment The
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashhad sentenced Mr. Narimani to death. This
    verdict was carried out at dawn on 21 December 1979.
