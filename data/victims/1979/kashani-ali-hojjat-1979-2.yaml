    Information regarding Lieutenant General Ali Hojat Kashani is drawn from
    the following: two E-forms that were sent to the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation (ABF) by two individuals close to him; a report by Kayhan Daily
    on 11 April 1979; another E-form sent to the ABF regarding Mr. Hassan
    Pakravan s case who was executed with Mr. Kashani; and Ayatollah Khalkhali
    s Memoir entitled The First Religious Judge after the Revolution
    (published in Spring 2001). Mr. Kashani s name is in the list of people
    who were executed by Ayatollah Khalkhali. Ali Hojat Kashani was born into
    a religious family in Dizelabad, a village within the city of Neishabur in
    Khorasan Province located in the northeast of Iran. His father and
    grandfather were religious figures in Khorasan Province. Mr. Kashani was
    the Head of Physical Education Department and the Deputy to Prime Minister
    Hoveyda. At the time of his management of the Physical Education
    Department, the famous sport facilities Azadi Stadium and the Olympic
    Village were built. He also held a doctorate degree from a university in
    the United States (ABF E-form, Kayhan). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Kashani s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran tried Mr. Kashani along with
    10 others. Kayhan Daily s detailed report of Mr. Kashani s trial reveal
    some issues which create serious doubts regarding the legitimacy of due
    process of law and the neutrality of the judge. For example, the judge
    addressed Mr. Kashani in a statement: You think that your gesture can
    influence the Revolutionary Court or the audience? In fact, this is not
    the only court that is trying you; 36 million Iranians dedicated their
    lives to try you now you act humanely and talk emotionally. If you have
    reasons, we will listen to you. We are appointed by the Imam and Iranian
    nation to do justice. In addition, the presumption of innocence which is
    one of the basic rights of any defendant was not respected; for example,
    the judge during the trial tells explicitly: You are not tried as a
    defendant; you are tried presuming that you are guilty! (Kayhan) Kayhan
    Daily reported that the trial started at the first hours of 11 April 1979
    and ended at 12:00 a.m. on 12 April. It is not clear from this report how
    much time was allocated to Mr. Kashani s trial. According to the E-form
    which was sent to the ABF regarding Mr. Pakravan, the trial of each
    defendant lasted only 15 minutes. Charges Kayhan Daily did not report Mr.
    Kashani s charges individually, but according to the report the charges of
    all the 11 people who were tried including Mr. Kashani were corruption on
    earth and treason . It seems that one of Mr. Kashani s charges was
    cooperation with the Shah s regime in general. The judge told him: You
    used to be one of the high ranking officials who misled the youth. Mr.
    Kashani s other charge included his position at the Physical Education
    Organization and organizing Olympics. During the trial, the judged stated:
    Do you remember that when you were in charge? You misled the youth by
    organizing fake events such as Olympics, etc whereas your task was to
    develop the youth in a healthy manner (Kayhan). The judge did not explain
    this charge any further. Mr. Kashani s reaction to the killing of two
    members of his family was another charge of his at the trial. He was
    constantly being questioned about his personal relationship with Mr.
    Bahman Adl and his wife, Kathrin Adl, two descendants of the Shah s regime
    who were killed in the 70s in a clash with the security forces. The judge
    asked Mr. Kashani why he talked against them in the newspapers and why he
    disowned them (Kayhan). Ayatollah Khalkhali claimed in his memoir that Mr.
    Kashani was responsible for the murder of his own family members. He said
    in another part of his memoir that: He went to war with Polisario Front at
    the direct order of Shah and the King of Morocco and there, he was killing
    the oppressed people of Sahara (Ayatollah Khalkhali s Memoir, pages
    396-397). In the Kayhan s report there is no indication of Mr. Kashani s
    mission to Morocco. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    concerning the evidence presented against Mr. Kashani. Defense There is no
    sign of the presence of a lawyer, the ,mere presenting of evidence on
    behalf of the defendant, or summoning witnesses on his behalf at Mr.
    Kashani s trial. Ayatollah Khalkhali wrote in his memoir about trying
    defendants without the presence of a lawyer: regarding the fact that we
    don t allow a lawyer in the court, I must say that according to the
    Islamic laws and the Islamic principles, there is no indication that
    somebody can chose a lawyer for himself, except when he is mute and the
    individuals whom we are trying are not mute and they are wise enough to
    answer our questions (Ayatollah Khalkhali s memoir, page 78) Mr. Kashani
    said about his family relations that he did not disown Mr. Adl and his
    wife, but in fact helped them and gave Mrs. Adl some money
