    Major Abdollah Manuchehri-Qashqa i is one of 438 victims listed in an
    Amnesty International report from March of 1980. The report lists
    defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period
    from their inception until August 12, 1979. The list of victims and
    charges is drawn from sources including translations of indictments,
    reports of trials carried out by local and foreign media, and the
    bulletins of the official Pars News Agency. Further information about this
    execution was sent to Omid, via several electronic forms, by persons
    familiar with the case. Mr. Manuchehri-Qashqa i, son of Yadollah, was a
    father of four, born in Ahvaz in 1941. He had a bachelor s degree from the
    military university and another bachelor s degree in English literature.
    He was a Major of the Nohed Brigade at Bagheshah Garrison, a member of the
    Committee for Combating Terrorism, and the Assistant Director of the
    military s Intelligence Unit in the Imperial Army. He was also an expert
    in neutralizing mines and bombs, having been trained at Fort Bragg, North
    Carolina, in the U.S. Arrest and Detention According to the electronic
    forms, agents went to his house in Tehran s Azarbayejan Street at
    midnight, in order to arrest Major Manuchehri-Qashqa i. However, since he
    was not home, they told the family that they would be back in the morning.
    On March 9, 1979, four Revolutionary Guards returned and arrested him
    without a warrant. He was detained at Qasr Prison. According to a person
    close to him, Mr. Manuchehri-Qashqa i had been instructed to sweep for
    mines in Evin Prison after the revolution. The officials promised not to
    charge him but arrested him after he finished his mine-sweeping job. He
    was denied the right to an attorney. Trial Amnesty International's report
    on this execution contains no information regarding the defendant's
    identity or trial. According to a person close to him, Mr.
    Manuchehri-Qashqa i was tried in a kangaroo court session, taking no more
    than half an hour, without any legal representation. Charges The charge
    against Major Manuchehri-Qashqa i is listed in the Amnesty International
    report as a corrupter on earth. The form mentions that among Mr.
    Manuchehri-Qashqa i s belongings was a tape of his will, in which he
    mentioned that he was being charged with having "repressed the people of
    Tehran. He was also charged for escaping. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt No
    information is available on the evidence presented against Major Abdollah
    Manuchehri-Qashqah i. Defense No information is available regarding the
    defense of the accused. According to a person close to him, Mr.
    Manuchehri-Qashqa i believed in his innocence and did not defend himself.
    In defending the escaping charge, he only mentioned that he had been busy
    with the treatment of his sick daughter who was suffering from Sciatica of
    the leg. Judgment No specific information regarding the Major
    Manuchehri-Qashqa i s death sentence is available. According to a person
    close to him, Major Manuchehri-Qashqa i was executed by firing squad,
    along with eleven others, at Qasr Prison in Tehran on March 13, 1979.
    According to this report, some officers of the Nohed Brigade intended to
    help prisoners escape; therefore, Ayatollah Khalkhali [Chief Justice of
    the Revolutionary Courts] came to Tehran from Qom by helicopter at night
    and ordered the prisoners be executed at Qasr prison. After Major
    Manuchehri-Qashqa i was executed, authorities gave his wife a court order
    that his belonging would be confiscated, and searched his house several
    times. His body was given to his family to be buried at the Behesht-e
    Zahra cemetery. His family used a different name on his tombstone for a
    long time in order to prevent it from being destroyed.
