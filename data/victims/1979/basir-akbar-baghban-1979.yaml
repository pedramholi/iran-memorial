    Kayhan Daily reported the execution of Mr. Aliakbar Baghban Basir, who was
    also known as Akbar Malideh, on 15 July 1979. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Baghban Basir’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Revolutionary Tribunal of Esfahan tried Mr. Baghban Basir.
    Charges Kayhan Daily reported Mr. Baghban Basir’s charges as the
    following: “kidnapping children and raping them; drug dealing and
    possession of heroin; selling children to voluptuous people; gambling;
    attacking the Revolutionary Guards and assaulting a guard with a knife”.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available
    concerning Baghban Basir’s defense and it is not clear if he had the
    opportunity to defend himself effectively, for example whether he had
    access to a lawyer or the possibility to summon witnesses in his favor,
    etc. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Judgment The
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Esfahan sentenced Mr. Baghban Basir to death. He
    was executed by shooting at dawn on 15 July 1979.
