    Information about the execution of Mr. Bahar Vojdani (also spelled

    announcement made by the Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards in
    Mahabad published in Jomhouri Eslami Daily and Enqelab Eslami Daily
    (September 29th, 1979), and an excerpt from Haghighat Newspaper (September
    27th, 1979). Additional information was acquired from an interview
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran
    with an individual who was familiar with Mr. Vojdani (August 31st, 2019),
    and documents published on the Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran,
    including a short biography, Mr. Vojdani s letter to his family before
    execution (date is unknown), a letter from his wife, Mansureh Akhlaghi, to
    the governor of Western Azarbaijan about the execution of her husband
    (October 11th, 1979), and a letter from the Baha i community of Iran to
    Ayatollah Qoddusi, signed by Dr. Hossein Naji and Manuchehr Ghaem-Maghami,
    about the execution of a Baha i (October 11th, 1979). Mr. Bahar Vojdani is
    also one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999 report published by
    the Baha i International Community. The report, Iran s Secret Blueprint
    for the Destruction of a Religious Community , documents the persecutions
    of the members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the
    Baha is killed since 1978. (See also: www.question.bahai.org ). Additional
    information has been drawn from various issues of The Baha i World . See
    for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Mr. Bahar Vojdani was born
    in 1922 in Miandoab, West Azarbaijan, to a Baha i family (ABPI, Bio).
    After completing his high school education, he moved to Mahabad, where he
    owned a furniture store, with the goal of promoting Baha i principles. He
    served on the Local Spiritual Assembly of Miandoab for many years (ABPI,
    Bio). According to an interview with an acquaintance, Mr. Vojdani was kind
    and caring, and respected his wife and kids very much (ABC Interview
    August 31, 2019). The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background
    The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the
    Baha i threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national
    security in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Baha i
    National Spiritual Assembly After the Islamic Revolution In the
    organizational structure of the Baha i community, the institution of the
    National Spiritual Assembly is a body composed of nine individuals that
    are elected annually with the votes of adult Baha is in each country. This
    institution tends to the affairs and issues of the Baha i community on the
    national level. The National Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of
    guiding, coordinating, and moving forward the activities of each country s
    local spiritual assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl (
    House of Justice ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the
    highest decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I
    s Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual
    assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz,
    were severely persecuted and the majority of their members were executed.
