circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Khosro Hosseinzadeh and another individual was
    reported by the correspondent of the Pars New Agency in Kermanshah. The
    Enqelab Easlami and Kayhan newspapers published the news (September 25,
    1979). Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial Based on the report, the trial was held
    on Monday, September 24, 1979. Charges The defendant was charged with
    “repeated acts of sodomy.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kermanshah
    declared Mr. Hosseinzadeh a “corruptor on earth” and sentenced him to
    death. He and another person were executed in Dizel Abad Prison in
    Kermanshah on September 24, 1979.
