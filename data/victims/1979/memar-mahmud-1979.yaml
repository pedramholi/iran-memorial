    Mr. Mahmoud Maymar is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980
    Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have executed individuals on trumped up charges such as drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention No
    information regarding the defendant's arrest and detention is available.
    Trial Amnesty International's report on this execution contains no
    information regarding the defendant's identity or trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Maymar, according to the Amnesty report, were:
    corruption on earth; war on God; massacre during demonstrations, causing
    death to unnamed persons during demonstrations, killing freedom fighters,
    killing Muslims; suppressing demonstrators, suppressing national and
    religious demonstrations, punishing demonstrators. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available on the evidence presented against Mr. Maymar.
    Defense No information is available on the defence. Judgment The defendant
    was sentenced to death and executed. No further information is available.
