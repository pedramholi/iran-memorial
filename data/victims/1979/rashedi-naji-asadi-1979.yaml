    The information about Mr. Naji Asadi Rashedi, son of Ebrahim, was sent to
    the Boroumand Foundation through two electronic forms by individuals
    familiar with this case. According to this information, he was born in
    Arvand Kenar in 1950. He was married and had two daughters. He was a sixth
    grade graduate and a barge captain. According to one of the electronic
    forms, he was affiliated with the Khalq-e Arab political organization.
    However, according to the other electronic form, he had no political
    affiliation. The news about Mr. Asadi Rashedi’s execution was published in
    the Enqelab Eslami newspaper on September 29, 1979. This newspaper
    published two separate reports about his execution. Arrest and detention
    According to information sent via the electronic forms, Mr. Asadi Rashedi
    was arrested in his home in Khorram Shahr at midnight of September 18,
    1979. He was arrested without a warrant in order to answer some questions.
    Mr. Asadi Rashedi was detained at a school and denied the right to have an
    attorney. Trial According to the Enqelab Eslami newspaper, Mr. Asadi
    Rashedi was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Abadan and Khorram
    Shahr on September 27, 1979 and this court “confirmed his crimes.” Charges
    According to one of the reports published in Enqelab Eslami newspaper, Mr.
    Asadi Rashedi was charged with “distributing weapons among the
    anti-revolutionaries, plotting to attack a division of the Khorram Shahr
    police department with an RPG-7, having direct communications with foreign
    states, inciting the youth against the Islamic Republic’s regime,” and
    also “a corrupter on earth and waging a war against God.” According to
    another report by the same newspaper on the same date, he was charged with
    “having contacts with the Iraqi Ba’ath Party, importing illegal weapons,
    attacking a police station with RPG-7, and plotting against the Islamic
    Republic’s regime.” Based on one of the electronic forms, he was charged
    with “membership in the Khalq-e Arab .” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt Based
    on the information provided in the electronic forms, no evidence was
    provided against Mr. Asadi Rashedi during his trial. Defense No
    information is available on this defendant’s defense. Judgment The Islamic
