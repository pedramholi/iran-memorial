place_of_death: "Qom"
province: "Markazi"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    The execution of Sergeant Major Molud Shakeri was reported by the
    correspondents of the Kayhan daily (October 2, 1979) and the Pars News
    Agency in Qom. The Enqelab Eslami daily of October 4, 1979 published the
    Pars report. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Pars report
    mentioned that the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Qom met several times
    to examine the defendant’s case. Charges Sergeant Shakeri was charged with
    “murdering Ahmad Babai, the son (or brother?) of the Kayhan daily
    representative in Qom.” Based on the report, Mr. Babai was stabbed and
    injured when, “driven by his religious duty, he was forbidding Sergeant
    Shakeri from evil.” He died an hour later at the hospital. Evidence of
    guilt The reports referred to the “witness’s testimonies,” but the nature
    and circumstances of the testimonies remain unknown. The Pars
    correspondent also referred to a report by the Criminal Police Station #
    3. Defense The reports merely mentioned that the defendant’s defense was
    heard. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Qom sentenced
    Sergeant Shakeri to death, “after hours of deliberation.” He was executed
    at 2:30 a.m., 6 to 9 days after his alleged crime.
