    He had written on the independence of judges and the presumption of
    innocence and was ready to defend himself, if tried. In Revolutionary
    Courts, however, defendants were presumed guilty and judges mandated to
    kill. The news of the execution of Lieutenant General Fakhroddin Modarres
    and six other men was published by the daily Ettela at on March 5, 1979
    (Pars News Agency, March 6, 1979). The news was also published in the
    Kayhan daily (March 5, 1979). Additional biographic information was drawn
    from electronic communications with sources close to him and from a
    monthly publication of Iran s Judiciary, Mahnameyeh Qaza i . Lt. General
    Modarres is also one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty
    International report. The report lists defendants who were convicted by
    Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception until 12 August
    1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from sources including
    translations of indictments, reports of trials carried out by local and
    foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News Agency reports.
    Lt. General Modarres was born on September 28, 1917 in a family of judges
    and clerics in Esfahan and had a successful law career in the Royal Armed
    Forces prior to the revolution. He graduated from the military academy in
    1938 as Second Lieutenant of Artillery. In addition to his military
    education, he studied law, and obtained a PhD in criminal law at the
    University of Paris. From 1944 to 1948, he worked at the Military
    Prosecution Office. He then served in the Khorasan Brigade as the Central
    Brigade Chief of Staff and continued to serve in various judicial
    functions until 1959. He also worked as a legal adviser at the Ministry of
    War for four years. He was Military Prosecutor until December 24, 1970
    when he headed the newly created Supreme Disciplinary Court of Military
    Judges. On April 19, 1971, he was nominated the Head of the Royal Armed
    Forces Justice Department and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General
    on September 24, 1971. He retired in September 1978. (E-mail communication
    with ABF) During his years of service, Lt. General Modarres was honored
    and decorated many times with medals including for his meritorious service
    , effort , and order of service. According to the Mahnameyeh Qaza i , he
    believed that a powerful army was the key to preserving the independence
    and security of the country, and to safeguarding the monarchy. He was
    convinced that to reach the above-mentioned goals, the army needed
    discipline and laws had to be properly and forcefully implemented. His
    legal opinion was highly respected among his peers and his writings, on
    the independence of judges ( Mahnameyeh Qaza i, no 69 ) or the presumption
    of innocence ( Mahnameyeh Qaza i, no 89 ) for example, are still quoted by
    jurists calling for legal reform and a more independent judiciary in Iran.

    independence and security of the country, and to safeguarding the
    monarchy. He was convinced that to reach the above-mentioned goals, the
    army needed discipline and laws had to be properly and forcefully
    implemented. Based on the testimony given by sources close to Lt. General
    Modarres to Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation, he was a simple, religious,
    and kind man who stayed away from the Royal Court s festivities and did
    not use his influence to accumulate wealth. He enjoyed walking in his
    garden with his granddaughter and watching the quince trees grow. He had
    been repeatedly warned to leave the country after his retirement, but he
    refused and insisted that he had not done anything illegal and could
    defend himself when they put him on trial. Lt. General Modarres, along
    with 22 other officials of the previous regime, were tried once on
    February 17 and sentenced to death. However, according to the Kayhan
    newspaper dated February 18, 1979, on an order from Ayatollah Khomeini,
    the death sentences were not enforced for 19 individuals, including Lt.
    General Modarres. Arrest and detention No information regarding Mr.
    Fakhroldin Modarres's arrest and detention is available. Trial Based on
    the Pars News Agency report, the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Iran
    tried Lt. General Modarres and six other officials of the former regime on
    March 4, 1979. The court was in session for nine hours, discussing and
    deliberating about a number of cases, including the defendant s case. The
    specific circumstances of the trial remain unknown. Charges No individual
    charges were specified for Lt. General Modarres. Collectively, the seven
    defendants were charged with participation in murder and massacre of
    innocent people. Evidence of guilt No information is available on the
    evidence presented against Lt. General Modarres. The Kayhan report
    referred to the testimonies of eyewitnesses for other former officials and
    mentions some unspecified documents in the court s possession. Defense The
    court s proceedings were held behind closed doors after the eyewit
