    The news of the execution of Ms. Ersiyeh Shahrivar was published in the
    newspaper Enqelab-e Eslami , September 22, 1979. The news included
    information regarding other individuals allegedly involved in this case.
    Reportedly, the two lovers of the defendant, Dariush Amir Hoseyni and
    Mohammad Ali Karimi, were each sentenced to four months of corrective
    imprisonment. Also, Ali Zare'i was sentenced to three months of
    imprisonment, one hundred lashes, and fined 900,000 rials (approximately
    $10,000.00). Fatemeh Zare'i was found guilty of helping the defendant; she
    was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. Four others were each
    sentenced to one hundred lashes. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman tried the defendant in
    one session. Charges The charge against Ms. Shahrivar was "adultery."
    Evidence of guilt According to the newspaper report, the evidence against
    the defendant was her own confession. Defense No information is available
    on Ms. Shahrivar 's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    of Kerman found the defendant guilty of "adultery." Ms. Sharivar was
    executed immediately after her verdict was issued.
