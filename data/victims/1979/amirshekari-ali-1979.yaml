    The execution of Mr. Ali Amirshekari was announced in the Kayhan newspaper
    on August, 25, 1979. Additional information has been gathered from the
    Kayhan newspaper (August 29, 1979), the Enqelab-e Eslami newspaper
    (September 27, 1979), the Akhbar Rooz website (August 21, 2010), and an
    electronic form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. His
    name is also cited in the list “Yadnameh”, published by the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, Majority Branch (April 2002: Koln). According to Enqelab-e
    Eslami , “the defendant’s brother had been arrested for his
    counter-revolutionary activities: the public surrendered him to the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal, and he was tried as an un-identified
    defendant. He announced that he was against Islam and a Communist. He was
    not condemned for ideological reasons and was pardoned. However, he was
    assassinated outside the city by unknown individuals.” The same report
    stated that Mr. Amirshekari’s execution gave rise to “rumors.” No further
    information is available. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist
    Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla
    movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups
    opposed to the Pahlavi regime. After the 1979 Revolution, the
    organization, which renounced armed struggle, split over their support of
    the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Majority
    supported and considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and
    anti-imperialist regime. After the spring of 1983, however, the Islamic
    Republic targeted its members solely because of their political beliefs.
    Arrest and detention According to Akhbar Rooz, Mr. Amirshekari was
    arrested immediately after his older brother’s assassination. No further
    information is available regarding his arrest and detention. Trial He was
    tried by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman. Charges The Kayhan
    newspaper (August 25) announced the charges brought against Mr.
    Amirshekari as “encoded communication with counter-revolutionary groups in
    Kordestan and Khuzestan, open opposition and plotting against the Islamic
    Republic of Iran.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The initial report of this
    execution did not include any reference to evidence against the defendant.
    Enqelab-e Eslami (September 27; more than a month after Mr. Amirshekari’s
    execution) stated that Mr. Amirshekari’s house had been identified by a
    taxi driver who had drove Mr. Amirshekari before, but the date of this
    discovery was not mentioned. Kayhan (August 29; 6 days after the
    execution) stated that: “in a search of his house, many leaflets of the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization,
    communists publications and photo-albums were discovered.” Enqelab-e
    Eslami reported that in addition to such leaflets, “explosive, a copying
    machine, encoded [phone] numbers in Kordestan, Khuzestan, and Baluchestan
    were found [in his house] and he refused to decipher the codes. This
    proves that he had contact with counter-revolutionaries that plotted
    against the Islamic regime in Kordestan; and it was clear that [Mr.
    Amirshekari] was inspired by such groups.” Whether the evidence was
    discovered before or after the execution is not known. Defense Akhbar Rooz
    states that in his trial, he was asked “to give a televised interview
    during which he should condemn his brother as an affiliate of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization, or else he would be executed. In response Ali defended
    his brother’s revolutionary goals and the public’s democratic demands.”
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman called Mr. Ali
    Amirshekari a “corruptor on earth, and at war with God and his prophet”
    and condemned him to death. Mr. Amirshekari was shot by a firing squad on
    August 23, 1979 in Kerman.
