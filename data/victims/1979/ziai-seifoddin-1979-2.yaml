    Mr. Zia i graduated from Tehran University and worked as a laboratory
    technician in his home city of Paveh, in Kermanshah. With no political
    associations, he was nevertheless perceived to be anti-revolutionary.
    Information about Mr. Seifoddin Zia i case has been drawn from an
    interview with a relative of his by the Boroumand Foundation, from the
    book Sahifeh-ye Emam by Ayatollah Khomeini, volume 9, the book Ayam-e
    Enzava (Times of Solitude) by Ayatollah Khalkhali, the report The Demise
    of Sadeq Khalkhali by Mansur Boluri (Iranian Political Bulletin, 30
    November 2003), the report Murder at Mykonos published by the Iran Human
    Rights Documentation Center, an electronic form sent to Omid, as well as
    the Kayhan newspaper dated August 21, 1979, which mistyped his name
    Feizoddin. Mr. Zia i was born into a well-respected family in Paveh
    (Kermanshah province). He was a graduate of Tehran University in clinical
    laboratory science, and worked as a laboratory technician at the Paveh
    Hospital. He did not have any political affiliation. Mr. Zia i s execution
    was part of a wave of executions that took place in order to combat the
    anti-Revolutionary elements in Kurdistan. Following the negotiations
    between the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) and the interim
    prime minister, several clashes occurred, at times armed, between the
    Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI)
    particularly in the cities of Sanandaj (Kurdistan province) and Paveh.
    These intensifying conflicts between the new central Shiite government of
    Iran and the mainly Sunni province of Kordestan concerned the role of
    minorities in the drafting of the constitution, specification of Shiite as
    the official state religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region.
    Subsequent to conflicts that resulted in some casualties, on August 18,
    1979, Ayatollah Khomeini issued an order to the military and the armed
    forces to move to Paveh and end the fighting In the same order, he
    encouraged them to use force and threatened that: if they do not move
    toward Paveh within 24 hours with missiles and tanks and all necessary
    arsenals, I will hold them accountable. And in case of any infringement of
    this order, I will treat them in a Revolutionary manner ( Sahifeh-ye Emam
    , p. 285). On August 19, Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the party of
    Satan and declared it unofficial and illegal noting that some of these
    anti-Islamic individuals had boycotted the referendum of April 1, when
    people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime ( ibid p.
    311). In accordance with Khomeini s order, Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali
    traveled the western region of Iran and told a reporter from the Ettela at
    newspaper: I will visit all areas of Kurdistan and will bring to justice
    anybody who was involved in these bloody plots ( Times of Solitude p. 96).
    According to Mr. Boluri, Ayatollah Khalkhali condemned at least 58 Kurds
    to death in the span of 10 days. Mass executions and conflicts continued
    for many months in that region. Arrest and detention According to the
    interviewee, Mr. Zia i was arrested on August 13, 1979. On their way to
    work, Mr. Zia i and his colleague drove by the base of the Intelligence
    Unit of the Revolutionary Guards Corps. Mr. Zia i was arrested by
    revolutionary guards without a warrant. During his one-week detention, he
    was kept incommunicado at the Intelligence Unit of the Revolutionary
    Guards Corps. According to statements of Mohammad Ali Razizadeh, the
    religious judge in Kermanshah, it appears that authorities prohibited the
    families from visiting the prisoners: I request the families to look after
    their children and watch for any anti-Revolutionary behavior or activity.
    [I also ask them] not to follow up with the cases of their children and
    let the Revolutionary Tribunals carry out their functions ( Kayhan August
    23, 1979, p. 3). Trial According to Kayhan , Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali
    having visited the damaged parts of the city [Paveh] including a hospital,
    which was badly damaged by the attackers examined the files of the
    offenders and after 14 hours of deliberation he condemned 9 individuals to
    death, including Mr. Zia i ( Kayhan August 21, 1979, p. 2). Ayatollah
    Khalkhali calls this session a Revolutionary summary trial ( Times of
    Solitude p. 95). Mr. Rezazadeh denied the rumors of execution of leftists
    without trial ( Kayhan August 23, 1979, p. 3). Charges The charges brought
    against the defendant are not known. Evidence of guilt Ayatollah Khalkhali
    mentions in his memoir that: all the executed individuals confessed during
    the interrogation that they had participated in the armed invasion of
    Paveh ( Times of Solitude p. 96). International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No infor
