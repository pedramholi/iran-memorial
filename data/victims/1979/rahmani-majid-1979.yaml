    The information about the execution of Mr. Majid Rahmani states that is
    "followed an altercation that took place in Shari'at Kangavar school in
    Kermanshah over ideological disagreement. The defendant assaulted and
    killed his schoolmate with a knife." International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of
    the basic guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    However, the report indicates that the alleged crime took place on
    Wednesday, and the defendant was executed on Friday. The detention period
    of Mr. Rahmani was less than 48 hours. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant’s trial except that the investigation and the trial
    lasted less than 48 hours. Charges The defendant was charged with the
    murder of his classmate Mr. Akbar Shafi'i. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Rahmani's defense. Judgment According to the report, the death sentence
    was issued by the Shari'a judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Kermanshah and was carried out the morning of Friday, August 31, 1979, in
    Dizelabad prison in Kermanshah.
