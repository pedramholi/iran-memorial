    Major General Ahmad Bidabadi is among the seven men, whose execution was
    reported by the Pars News Agency on March 5, 1979, and published in the
    Ettela’at newspaper the following day. He is also one of 438 victims
    listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists
    defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period
    from their inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges
    is drawn from sources including translations of indictments, reports of
    trials carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the
    official Pars News Agency reports. Moreover, Major General Bidabadi is one
    of 55 persons mentioned in the Memoirs of Ayatollah Khalkhali, the first
    post-revolution religious judge and head of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal. In his book, he writes: “I began to try the convicts soon after
    my nomination… All the people who were sentenced to death by the
    Revolutionary Tribunals were the best examples of a ‘corruptor on earth’
    and they were executed as such… “A corruptor on earth is a person who
    contributes to spreading and expanding corruption on earth. Corruption is
    what leads to the decline, destruction, and the deviation of society from
    its natural course. The executed persons had participated in the spread of
    corruption and prostitution, distribution of heroin and opium, and
    promotion of licentious behavior, godlessness, murder, treason, flattery,
    and in sum, they possessed all vile attributes. These people’s problems
    were aggravated by the fact that they did not repent, even after they
    witnessed the people’s revolution. “I believed, and still believe, that
    all the parliamentarians and senators, all governors, heads of SAVAK
    [National Intelligence and Security Organization] and police officers, who
    held office after 1963, and after Emam [Khomeini] ordered the boycott [of
    parliamentary election], should be executed… High-ranking officials in the
    ministries, who were instrumental in the survival of the apparatus [Shah’s
    regime] and who would accept any humiliation to get close to the Shah and
    his family, are all condemned [to execution]… “In sum, all the people whom
    I condemned to death and who were executed in the early days of the
    establishment of the Revolutionary Tribunals and in Qasr prison, were
    corruptors on earth. Based on the Quran, their life was a waste… Not one
    of them could be acquitted according to the Quran.” Arrest and detention
    No information is available on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial
    Based on the report, the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Iran was in
    session for 9 hours, deliberating seven cases, including Mr. Bidabadi’s.
    The specific circumstances of the trial remain unknown. Charges Personal
    charges brought against Major General Bidabadi were not announced. The
    seven co-defendants were collectively charged with “participation in
    murder and massacre of innocent people.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available on the evidence presented against Major General
    Bidabadi. Defense No information is available regarding Mr. Bidabadi’s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Iran declared
    Major General Bidabadi a “corruptor on earth.” The Tribunal reached its
    verdict at 5 in the morning and Mr. Ahmad Bidabadi was shot by firing
    squad immediately.
