    Information on the disappearances of Mr. Mohammad Movahed, son of Mohammad
    Ali Sheikh Movahed (a prominent cleric from the city of Shiraz) and Ms.
    Zakieh Baladi, was published in the Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran
    website (May 14, 2019), the Martyrs of the Baha i Faith website (August
    22, 2008), and Tavana website (May14, 2019). Mr. Movahed left an audiotape
    behind in which he provided his biography and an account of his conversion
    to the Baha i faith. Mr. Movahed was born in 1938-39 in the city of Shiraz
    in a religious Islamic family. His father was a teacher at the Agha Baba
    Khan seminary in Shiraz and had a large number of student clerics. Like
    his father, Mr. Movahed had seminary education [and was a cleric]. On
    Friday, August 26, 1966, at a mosque in Tehran, Mr. Movahed revealed to
    his students and his brothers that he had been studying the Baha i faith
    for eight years and that he believed in the Baha i faith. Mr. Movahed
    thought that he might not leave the mosque alive that day (Martyrs of the
    Baha i Faith). His belief in the Bahai faith was unfathomable for his
    friends and family as well. Upon returning to Shiraz, Mr. Movahed engaged
    in a great many discussions with other clergymen. According to him Then
    there was a lot of discussion. At the end of the meeting I said I am a
    Baha i; do what you will Then one of the leading clerics wrote a letter to
    the Prosecutor s Office (during the reign of the Shah) telling him that
    someone had become a Baha i and that he and others knew that that person
    would revert back to Islam and will not stay Baha i because he was not a
    bad person, but that in the meantime, the people would kill him, and that
    would be to the advantage of the Baha i sect and to the detriment of
    Islam; he must be protected somehow, and it s best if we take him to an
    insane asylum. The Prosecutor s Office accepted that argument, and the
    Police Force Information [Section] and the State Information Organization
    approved the decision, and I was taken to an insane asylum. (Mr. Movahed s
    conversation on audiotape). Mr. Movahed was hospitalized in the insane
    asylum for 95 days. While there, clerics from various cities would go to
    see him on a daily basis in order to talk to him and bring him back to
    Islam, but he would not let go of his belief in the Baha i faith. (Baha i
    Martyrs). After enduring much harassment and pressure in Shiraz, Mr.
    Movahed moved to Tehran. (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran website).
    Mr. Movahed was married in 1975-76 and his wife also converted to the Baha
    i religion. He had two children. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected
    the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest
    religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979*- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.** Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the time
    of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified and
    institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah
    Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain instances,
    even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to Iran, in
    response to a question regarding political and religious freedom of Baha
    is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated:
    They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They will
    not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they be
    free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Mr. Movahed s Extrajudicial Killing According
    to available information, Mr. Movahed left his house early in the morning
    of May 24, 1979, and no one ever heard from him again. His wife went to
    the relevant government offices in order to obtain information about him
    but was unable to do so. It is believed that Mr. Movahed was kidnapped by
    an unidentified person. At some point, there was rumor going around that
    he was at Evin Prison or at Qasr Prison, and that he had been transferred
    to the city of Qom to be interrogated, and that he would be tried very
    soon. But no exact or credible trace of him was ever found. One of his
    children was born two months after his disappearance. Officials Reaction
    After the Revolution, Mr. Movahed had been summoned to the Guards
    Committee accused
