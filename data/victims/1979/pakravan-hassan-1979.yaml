    General Pakravan s bookshelves featured philosophy and history. His own
    contributions to history were notable, as well. In 1963 he pleaded against
    the execution of Khomeini. Lt. General Hassan Pakravan is one of 438
    victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The
    report lists defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in
    the period from their inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims
    and charges is drawn from sources including translations of indictments,
    reports of trials carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins
    of the official Pars News Agency reports. Mr. Pakravan, is also one of 10
    defendents mentioned in the Memoirs of Ayatollah Khalkhali, the first
    post-revolution religious judge and head of the Islamic Revolutionary
    tribunal. In its April 11th, 1979 issue, the newspaper Kayhan published a
    report on the trial of General Pakravan. Mr. Pakravan's Daughter, Saideh,
    provided Omid with additional information regarding his biography and his
    trial. Background Information As a high ranking security official, General
    Pakravan was familiar with the case of Ayatollah Khomeini before the
    revolution. According to Mr. Pakravan's daughter : "Hassan Pakravan was
    Head of Security during the riots of 1963 that were fomented by the
    mullahs against the Shah s White Revolution. He had Khomeini, a
    hodjat-ol-eslam at the time, arrested but when the military recommended a
    quick trial which would lead to his execution for treason, General
    Pakravan personally intervened and threatened to resign. The Shah, caught
    between conflicting advice, asked Pakravan to find a way to save Khomeini
    s life. Pakravan sought the guidance of men familiar with religious
    matters and came back to the Shah with the solution: If Khomeini were
    elevated to the rank of Ayatollah, he would become untouchable. The Shah
    agreed to the plan. Pakravan immediately went to Seyyed Jalal Tehrani and
    to the Ayatollah Shariat Madari s residence in Qom (both men were marja e
    taqlid or source of emulation ) and obtained from them that they pronounce
    the formula that made Khomeini an ayatollah. The cleric s life was thus
    spared. Some time later, he was sent into exile, first to Turkey and then
    to Iraq." Arrest and detention According to the defendent's daughter, Mr.
    Pakaravan was arrested on February 16th, 1979, four days after the fall of
    the former regime. After his arrest by revolutionary guards, "his personal
    library, which numbered thousands of books with a particular focus on
    history and philosophy, and his unique collection of travel memoirs of
    Europeans to Iran that went as far back as the sixteenth century, were
    looted along with the rest of his possessions." . Trial According to the
    newspaper Kayhan and the defendant's relative, the trial took place in the
    early hours of April 11th, 1979. It, reportedly lasted 15 minutes. There
    was no appeal. Charges Mr. Pakravan was charged with "treason" and
    "corruption on earth". In his memoirs, the judge who tried Mr. Pakravan
    explained the meaning of "corruption on earth" in the following terms : "A
    Corruptor on earth is a person who contributes to spreading and expanding
    corruption on earth. Corruption is what leads to the decline, destruction
    and the deviation of society from its nature. People who were executed had
    strived in spreading corruption and prostitution, circulating heroin,
    opium and licencious behavior, atheism, murder, betrayal, flattery, and,
    in sum, all these vile qualities. These people s problems were aggravated
    by the fact that they did not repent once they saw the people s
    revolution." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available on the
    evidence presented against Lt. General Pakravan. Defense The defendant was
    not allowed to hire a lawyer. According to Saideh Pakravan : "he pleaded
    no extenuating circumstance of any kind and made no attempt to shift the
    blame from himself to the system . Quite the opposite, he manfully said
    that any action he had undertaken in his official functions was his
    responsibility and his alone." The defendent reportedly asked the judge
    about the meaning of the term corruption on earth of which he was accused.
    "The judge, not realizing that he was invited into a etymological and
    philosophical discussion, cursorily replied that corruption of earth was
    what Pakravan had been guilty of." Judgment Tehran' Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal found Mr. Pakravan guilty of "treason" and "Corruption on earth".
    According to his daughter : "At a quarter to two in the morning, Pakravan
    was taken out to the yard of the prison and executed summarily by a direct
    shot through the heart from a semi-automatic and another shot through the
    neck after he fell. Although there are many documented instances of family
    members of condemned officials visiting them a few hours before their
    execution, i
