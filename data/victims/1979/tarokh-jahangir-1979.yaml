    Mr. Jahangir Tarohk is among the seven men, whose execution was reported
    by the Pars News Agency on March 5, 1979, and published in the Ettela’at
    newspaper the following day. He is also one of 438 victims listed in a
    March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants
    who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their
    inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn
    from sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials
    carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official
    Pars News Agency reports. Arrest and detention No information is available
    on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial Based on the report, the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Iran was in session for 9 hours,
    deliberating seven cases, including Mr. Tarohk’s. The specific
    circumstances of the trial remain unknown. Charges Personal charges
    brought against Mr. Tarohk were not announced. The seven co-defendants
    were collectively charged with “participation in murder and massacre of
    innocent people.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    on the evidence presented against Mr. Tarohk. Defense No information is
    available regarding Mr. Tarohk’s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Iran declared Mr. Tarohk a “corruptor on earth.”
    The Tribunal reached its verdict at 5 in the morning on March 5, 1979, and
    Mr. Jahangir Tarohk was shot by firing squad immediately.
