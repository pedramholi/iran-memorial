circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mahmud Asadi along with three others including his
    father and uncle was reported by the correspondents of the Enqelab Eslami
    and Kayhan dailies in Malayer (September 13, 1979). The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Arrest and detention Based on the reports, a
    group of 40 Police and Islamic Revolutionary Committee Guards, headed by
    Captain Ghiasvand and Hosein Maleki, were involved in arresting the
    defendant and eight other alleged smugglers. Trial Mr. Asadi’s trial,
    headed by a religious judge, was reportedly held in the presence of a
    large number of people at the amphitheatre of Dr. Shari’ati High School in
    Malayer. The session was held at night and lasted several hours. Charges
    Based on the Kayhan report, Mr. Asadi was part of a drug cartel equipped
    for producing and distributing heroin. Evidence of guilt Reportedly, the
    defendant and the other alleged smugglers were found in possession of 13
    kilograms of heroin in one-kilogram packages, one pistol, one kilogram of
    opium sap, 25 kilograms of carbonate used for making heroin, and a
    complete set of heroin laboratory devices. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Malayer sentenced Mr. Asadi to death. Based on the Kayhan report, he was
    executed at dawn, shortly after the issuance of the verdict. All of his
    properties (orchards and farms) in the Juzan village were subsequently
    confiscated, excluding one residential unit.
