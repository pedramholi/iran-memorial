    Lt. Fereidoun Farsi, a police information officer, is one of 438 victims
    listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists
    defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period
    from their inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges
    is drawn from sources including translations of indictments, reports of
    trials carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the
    official Pars News Agency reports. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic’s authorities have executed individuals on trumped up charges
    such as drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact
    number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest
    and detention No information regarding the defendant's arrest and
    detention is available. Trial Amnesty International's report on this
    execution contains no information regarding the defendant's identity or
    trial. Charges The charges against Lt. Farsi, according to the Amnesty
    report, were: corruption on earth; war on God; torture (physical); armed
    attack, attacking people's homes, attacking demonstrators, shooting at
    people, direct interference to crush campaigners leading to murder and
    injury, firing on demonstrations, injuring demonstrators;
    counter-revolutionary tactics, being a counter-revolutionary, conspiracy
    against the Islamic Republic, revolt against the Islamic Republic. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available on the evidence presented
    against Lt. Farsi. Defense No information is available on the defence.
    Judgment The defendant was sentenced to death and executed. No further
    information is available.
