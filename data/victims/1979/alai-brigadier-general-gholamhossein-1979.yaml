    Loyal to country, loyal to Shah, is the impression he made on those close
    to him. He never opted to leave, once the events of 1979 made him
    vulnerable. The information regarding Brigadier General Gholamhossein Ala
    i s case was drawn from various emails, including an Electronic form (ABF
    E-form), his execution verdict and the official death certificate, which
    were sent to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) by individuals
    close to him; and from two reports by two separate daily newspapers:
    Kayhan, 2 June 1979 and Jomhuri Eslami, 3 June 1979. Brigadier General Ala
    i was a member of the army and held the titles of Commander of the
    Masjedsoleiman Garrison and Commander of the Hakhamaneshi Tank
    Refurbishing and Remanufacturing Factory. He was an officer of the army
    intelligence unit (Rokne Do) and at times deputy commander. He also spent
    time in Iraq around 1965 as the military attach at the Embassy of Iran and
    served the last 4 years of his military career in Masjedsoleiman. At the
    time of his arrest, he was 55 and had two children. According to people
    close to him, he was not affiliated to any political groups or parties. He
    was very loyal to the country and the Shah, which contributed to the
    reason why he did not leave Iran after the 1979 Revolution. His family and
    friends remembered him as a kind and honest person (ABF E-forms and
    emails). Arrest and detention Brigadier General Ala i was arrested on 13
    February 1979 by his subordinate officers and members of Masjedsoleiman
    Revolutionary Committees at his house. The officials who made his arrest
    did not have a warrant (ABF E-form). Brigadier General Ala i was taken to
    the local office of the Revolutionary Committee in Masjedsoleiman, and
    after a couple of days he was transferred to Qasr Prison in Tehran. He
    also spent some time in Ahvaz Prison. His detention lasted from the 13th
    of February to the 2nd of June in 1979, during which he did not have
    access to a lawyer and was granted only two visitations with his family.
    The ABF E-form describes his family s visit to Qasr Prison: there were two
    rows of chicken-wire that had a two-meter distance from each other which
    separated the prisoners on one side and the families on the other side. A
    guard would go back and forth between the two rows to deliver the
    messages. Brigadier General Ala i told his wife during a visitation in
    Ahvaz Prison that he had been subjected to mock executions at least three
    times. In addition, there was a burn mark in his forehead. The guards
    apparently used to burn him there with a mohr a clayish stone on which
    Muslims put their foreheads for praying. This mark would imply that the
    person would be praying constantly. Trial Kayhan reported that the
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz tried Brigadier General Ala i along with 7
    others. This trial took place at 2:00 p.m. on Friday, 1 June 1979
    (Kayhan). But people close to him doubt that his trial ever took place
    (ABF E-forms and emails). Charges Kayhan reported Brigadier General Ala i
    s alleged charges along with 7 others collectively as: repression and
    persecution of innocent people; ordering to shoot directly a people which
    led to the murder and assault of the people of Ahvaz and the violent
    repression of the people of Khuzestan during their righteous
    demonstrations; deprivation of freedom and basic natural and Islamic
    rights; and waging war on God, the Prophet of God, the Twelfth Imam, and
    the Muslim people." People close to Brigadier General Ala i say that the
    real reason of his conviction was related to a feud that the judge,
    Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali, had with him. At the time Brigadier General Ala
    i was a military attach in Iraq, Ayatollah Khomeini was exiled to that
    country in 1965. During that time, many clerics came to visit Brigadier
    General Ala i to request assistance in their pardon, etc. One of these
    clerics was Ayatollah Khalkhali. But Brigadier General Ala i denied his
    request and when Ayatollah Khalkhali refused to leave his office, the
    Brigadier General called a couple of guards to throw him out (ABF email).
    Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense Based on the information
    provided, Brigadier General Ala i believed that he was innocent. According
    to people close to him, he wrote in his diary on the morning of his
    arrest: I did nothing wrong and up to this day there is no innocent blood
    on my hands. I will be acquitted after a short investigation. He was so
    confident about his innocence that even when there was a prison break at
    Ahvaz Prison during the onset of the revolution and all the prisoners
    escaped, he along with a small number of other prisoners of conscience
    refused to flee (ABF E-form and emails). Moreover, ABF s collected
    information and the report by Kayhan create serious doubts as to whether
    Brigadier General Ala i s right to due process was respected: 1.
    Throughout his detention, interrogation and trial, he was denied the legal
    assistance o
