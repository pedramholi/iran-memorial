circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ebrahim Rafi’i was reported by the correspondents of
    the Enqelab Easlami newspaper and Pars New Agency (September 23 and 25,
    1979). Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges Mr. Rafi’i was charged with “sodomizing a
    10-year-old boy.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sari declared Mr.
    Rafi’i a “corruptor on earth” and sentenced him to death. He was shot by
    firing squad on September 23, 1979 in Sari.
