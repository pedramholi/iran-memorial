    The report of Mr. Amir Qoli Darangzadeh’s trial and execution was
    published in the Kayhan and Enqelab Eslami newspapers of September 4 and
    5, 1979. Arrest and detention Based on the Kayhan report, Mr. Darangzadeh
    was arrested by Air Force officials of Shiraz at his home in Marvdasht
    (Fars Province) a few days before his trial. Trial The Kayhan report
    mentioned that the trial was held in the morning of September 2, and
    deliberation about the cases of Mr. Darangzadeh and two others lasted an
    hour altogether. Charges Mr. Darangzadeh was charged with “possession of
    72 grams of heroin and selling it to two distributors.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to Kayhan , at the time of arrest Mr. Darangzadeh was selling
    heroin to two individuals. Defense No information is available on the
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz declared
    Mr. Darangzadeh a “corruptor on earth, as described in the Koranic
    scripture.” He was shot by firing squad at midnight on September 4, 1979
    in Adel-Abad prison in Shiraz.
