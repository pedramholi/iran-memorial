    defendant’s trial other than he was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Bandar Abbas. Charges Mr. Tavakoli was charged with “sodomy.”
    The Kayhan report mentions other charges, but they are not included here
    since they were not confirmed by the Enqelab-e Eslami newspaper. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is

    Bandar Abbas condemned Mr. Kazem Tavakoli to death. He was executed at
    dawn on September 1, 1979.
