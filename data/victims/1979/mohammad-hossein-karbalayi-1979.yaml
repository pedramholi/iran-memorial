    Sergeant Hossein Karbalai Mohammad is one of 438 victims listed in a March
    13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who
    were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their
    inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn
    from sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials
    carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official
    Pars News Agency reports. The execution of Sergeant Karbalai Mohammad was
    also reported by the correspondent of the Ayandegan daily in Qazvin (March
    1, 1979). The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention No information about
    the defendant’s arrest and detention was provided. Trial The report
    mentioned that the defendant’s case was examined at the Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Qazvin and in the presence of Judiciary judges. The
    circumstances of the trial remain unknown. Charges Based on the report,
    the defendant was charged with “intentionally running over 4 children in
    the line for oil with an army automobile.” Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the
    defendant’s defense. Judgment Based on the report, the defendant was
    sentenced to death and executed at 4 a.m.
