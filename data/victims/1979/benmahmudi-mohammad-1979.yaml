    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Benmahmudi, son of Abdollah, was announced
    in the Kayhan newspaper on August 19, 1979. Additional information about
    this case has been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the book
    Sahifeh-ye Emam by Ayatollah Khomeini, volume 9, the book Ayam-e Enzava
    (Times of Solitude) by Ayatollah Khalkhali, the Kayhan newspaper (Aug. 23,
    and Sep. 25, 1979), the report “The Demise of Sadeq Khalkhali” by Mansur
    Boluri (Iranian Political Bulletin, Nov. 30, 2003), as well as the report
    Murder at Mykonos published by the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center.
    Mr. Benmahmudi’s execution was part of a wave of executions that took
    place in order to combat the “anti-Revolutionary” elements in the
    Kordestan region. Following the negotiations between the Kordish
    Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI) and the interim prime minister, several
    clashes occurred, at times armed, between the Revolutionary Guards and the
    peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI) particularly in the cities of Sanandaj
    (Kordestan province) and Paveh (Kermanshah province). These intensifying
    conflicts between the new central Shiite government of Iran and the mainly
    Sunni region of Kordestan concerned the role of minorities in the drafting
    of the constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state
    religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region. Subsequent to
    conflicts that resulted in some casualties, on August 18, 1979, Ayatollah
    Khomeini issued an order to the military and the armed forces to “move to
    Paveh and end the fighting…” In the same order, he encouraged them to use
    force and threatened that: “if they do not move toward Paveh within 24
    hours with missiles and tanks and all necessary arsenals, I will hold them
    accountable. And in case of any infringement of this order, I will treat
    them in a Revolutionary manner.” On August 19, Ayatollah Khomeini called
    the PDKI the “party of Satan” and declared it “unofficial and illegal”
    noting that some of these “anti-Islamic” individuals had boycotted the
    referendum of April 1, when people went to polls to vote for or against
    the Islamic regime. In accordance with Khomeini’s order, Ayatollah Sadeq
    Khalkhali traveled the western region of Iran and told a reporter from the
    Ettela’at newspaper: “I will visit all areas of Kordestan… and will bring
    to justice anybody who was involved in these bloody plots.” According to
    Mr. Boluri, Ayatollah Khalkhali condemned at least 58 Kords to death in
    the span of 10 days. Mass executions and conflicts continued for many
    months in that region. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Benmahmudi’s arrest and detention are not known. The 11 defendants were
    arrested by the Revolutionary Guards. Whether or not they had visits with
    their families before execution is not known. However according to
    statements of the religious judge in Kermanshah Province, it appears that
    authorities prohibited the families from visiting the prisoners: “I
    request the families to look after their children and watch for any
    anti-Revolutionary behavior or activity. [I also ask them] not to follow
    up with the cases of their children and let the Revolutionary Tribunals
    carry out their functions” ( Kayhan , Aug. 23, 1979). Trial The report of
    the execution does not refer to a trial and only mentions the
    interrogation of defendants and testimony of witnesses. In an interview
    dated August 23, the religious judge of Kermanshah denied “the rumors of
    execution of leftists without trial.” In another interview about the
    recent executions in the region he stated: “the proceedings were carried
    with outmost attention and careful investigation. The court has never
    acted outside the Islamic criteria since the court is not only responsible
    before the people, but it is also accountable before God… It is true that
    the trial had particularities of wartime, but the crimes were certainly
    proven based on explicit confession of defendants, testimony of witnesses,
    and other evidence; and the verdicts were issued and carried out in
    accordance with religious criteria.” The religious judge added: “Some
    newspapers, completely unaware of the reality of matters, have attacked
    the Islamic courts… Surely the objective for such misinformation is to
    advance counter-revolutionary plans” ( Kayhan , Sep. 25, 1979). Charges
    The newspaper refers to the 11 defendants as “combatants who invaded
    Paveh.” No further information is available regarding the charge brought
    against Mr. Benmahmudi. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense No
    information is available concerning Mr. Benmahmudi’s defense. Judgment Mr.
    Mohammad Benmahmudi and 10 other individuals were condemned to death as
    “corruptors on earth, and at war with God and God’s Prophet.” They were
    executed at 2:40 a.m. on August 18 in Dizel Abad prison of Kermanshah.
