    Mr. Allahvardi Ya’qubi is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980
    Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. This execution is also reported in the Kayhan newspaper on
    February 6, 1979. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial other than he was tried at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz. Charges According to the report of
    Amnesty International, the charges brought against Mr. Ya’qubi were:
    “corruption on earth, war on God, murder of innocent people, and beating.”
    The newspaper story adds to the charges: “homosexual rape of minors during
    curfew hours.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on his defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz condemned Mr. Allahvardi Ya’qubi to death.
    He was executed by a firing squad on February 6, 1979.
