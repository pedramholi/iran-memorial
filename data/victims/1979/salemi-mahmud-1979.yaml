    The execution of Mr. Mahmud Salemi was reported in the newspaper Enqelabe
    Eslami on September 1st, 1979. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. However, based on a
    letter to the Revolutionary Prosecutor of Saveh by the Central Province’s
    Governor, published in the daily Enqelab-e Eslami on February 20, 1980,
    prisoners were tortured at the time of the defendant’s detention. The
    letter, which is published along with the official minutes of his visit to
    the Saveh Police Headquarters and his meeting with the prisoners and a
    forensic doctor’s report regarding signs of torture on a detainee, reads
    as follows: “Mr. Abdollahi, Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor of Saveh,
    With all due respects, I am submitting the report of my visit to the
    Shahrebani Nedamatgah [Police Headquarters’ Detention Center] of Saveh and
    two attachments signed by the authorities at the Police Headquarters. Most
    prisoners have been tortured in such a way that is even distressing to
    describe. Even those individuals who have been arrested and tortured 40
    days ago are still showing clear signs of torture on their bodies. For
    most cases, the reason for the arrest is unclear. I urge you to take the
    appropriate measures and order an end to torture and investigate the
    situation of those existing [detainees] and report the findings to the
    Governor’s Office. [Signature]: Abbas Samii, Governor of Central
    Province”. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Saveh held three
    sessions to examine the charges brought against the defendant. Charges The
    defendant was charged with the murder of two individuals named Abolhassan
    Mandani and Mohammad Zeki. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    mentions the locality where the crime allegedly took place and the fire
    arm the defendant had used. At the time of the crime the defendant was
    serving as a revolutionary guard. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Salemi's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Saveh
    issued a death sentence against Mr. Salemi. He was executed on Thursday at
    3:35 am.
