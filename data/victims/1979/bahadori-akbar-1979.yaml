    Dr. Akbar Bahadori, a prominent politician and parliamentary
    representative for Arak, is one of the 438 victims listed in a March 13,
    1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until August of 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency. Additional information about Dr. Bahadori, son of Issa Khan, has
    been drawn from two electronic forms sent to the Boroumand Foundation.
    According to one of the forms, he was born at Akhchi Kahriz in Arak in
    1924. He was married and had four daughters. Based on one of these forms,
    Dr. Bahadori was a general surgeon and orthopedist in the armed forces and
    had his own private practice Bahadori Clinic in the south of Tehran. The
    sender of this electronic form remembers Dr. Bahadori as a generous man
    who built a high-tech hospital in Arak. According to the other electronic
    form, Dr. Bahadori was a physician, a parliamentarian, a Colonel in the
    military, and he worked at the Bahadori Hospital. According to both
    electronic forms, he had no political affiliations. A number of websites
    have written about Dr. Bahadori and his father, who was a reputable
    Iranian artist and painter. According to Essaabad blog, for example, Dr.
    Bahadori established a number of hospitals in Arak and Tehran in his life
    time, the most important of which was Qods Hospital in Arak. He also
    founded the Baqiatollah al-A zam Hospital in Tehran. Based on this blog
    and the Majlis Research Center website, Dr. Bahadori was a member of
    parliament before the revolution at the 24th Parliament. Arrest and
    detention No information regarding Dr. Bahadori s arrest and detention is
    available. Trial According to the Keyhan newspaper, dated April 23, 1979,
    Dr. Bahadori was tried by the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Arak and
    after 12 hours of interrogation, the court submitted Dr. Bahadori s case
    for the final judgment to Tehran. Charges The charges against Mr.
    Bahadori, according to the Amnesty report, were as follows: collaboration
    with the ousted regime and trying to re-establish the Shah s idolatrous
    rule over the weak and defenseless people; collaborating with SAVAK;
    taking wrong decisions in parliament; bringing pressure to divide the
    people, crimes against the people and the revolution, activities against
    the people during the revolution, crushing those seeking their rights,
    threatening villagers, conspiring to break the people's will, creating
    insecurity, creating terror among the public, and urging people to fight
    against the revolution. According to the Keyhan newspaper and the
    indictment by the Chief Prosecutor of the Islamic Revolutionary Court,
    however, he was charged with accessory to two murders, trespass to
    chattel, arson, and a number of other crimes. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have executed individuals on trumped up
    charges such as drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available on the evidence presented
    against Dr. Bahadori. Defense No information is available on the accused s
    defense. Judgment According to the Amnesty report, Dr. Bahadori was
    sentenced to death and his sentence was carried out on May 10, 1979 in
    Tehran.
