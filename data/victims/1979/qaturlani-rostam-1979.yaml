    The execution of Mr. Rostam Qaturlani, also known as Rostam Darhehchai'i,
    and another individual was reported by the official Pars News Agency and

    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial except that he
    was tried by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Orumieh on September 9,
    1979. The report also indicates that the case was examined and the verdict
    was issued in one session. Charges The charges brought against the
    defendant were "drug and arms trafficking", "corruption on earth and
    enmity with God." Evidence of guilt According to the prosecution, "47
    grams of heroin, 1.65 grams of opium sap, one Berno fire arm and different
    kinds of bullets," were found in Mr. Qaturlani's home. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Qaturlani's defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Orumieh, referring to "old police files" on the
    defendant and dismissing his defense as "baseless," found him guilty of
    "corruption on earth and enmity with God." Mr. Qaturlani was condemned to
    death. He was executed at dawn, five days after the verdict was issued.
