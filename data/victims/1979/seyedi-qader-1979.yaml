circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Qader Seyedi and two others was reported by the
    correspondent of the Kayhan daily in Kerman (August 11, 1979). He is one
    of 438 victims listed in a report of Amnesty International dated March 13,
    1980 (as an unnamed individual). The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges The defendant was charged with "robbery and
    armed attack." The prosecutor mentioned that the defendant and his
    accomplices had "caused traffic jam and martyred two Revolutionary
    Guards." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kerman declared Mr. Qader
    Seyedi a “corruptor on earth” and an “enemy of God” and sentenced him to
    death. The sentence was carried out immediately.
