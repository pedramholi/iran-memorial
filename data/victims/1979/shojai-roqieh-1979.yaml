province: "Khorasan\\Khorasan-e Razavi"

circumstances: >
    The execution of Ms. Roqieh Shoja’i and a man was reported by the
    correspondent of the Enqelab Eslami newspaper (September 12, 1979). Arrest
    and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges Ms. Shoja’i and her co-defendant were charged with “several counts
    of adultery.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on her defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabas (Yazd Province)
    sentenced Ms. Shoja’i to death. She was executed at 5:30 a.m. on September
    10, 1979.
