    The execution of Ms. Fakhri Musavi was reported by the correspondents of
    the Kayhan newspaper and Pars News Agency, and published in the Kayhan and
    the Enqelab Eslami newspapers on September 4, 1979. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Based on the Pars report, the trial was held on September 3, 1979.
    Charges Ms. Musavi was charged with “illicit relationship and deluding
    married women.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Khorramabad sentence Ms.
    Musavi to death. She was shot by firing squad on September 3, 1979.
