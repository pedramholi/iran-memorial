    The Kayhan newspaper published news of the execution of Mr. Seyed Kazem
    Ashrafzadeh (Seyed Ashrafi), along with two others, on April 8, 1979.
    Additional information is based on two electronic forms sent to Boroumand
    Foundation (ABF) by his relatives. Mr. Ashrafzadeh is also one of 438
    victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The
    report lists defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in
    the period from their inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims
    and charges is drawn from sources including translations of indictments,
    reports of trials carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins
    of the official Pars News Agency reports. According to the information
    from the e-form sent to ABF, Mr. Seyed Kazem Ashrafzadeh (Seyed Ashrafi),
    son of Seyed-Ebrahim, was born in Dezful in 1932. He was married with 13
    children. He had a primary school education and worked at an
    Iranian-American Industrial Agriculture Company as the head of security.
    Arrest and detention According to an electronic form, Mr. Ashrafzadeh was
    arrested by Revolutionary Guards without warrant at Ayatollah Qazi s
    residence when he went to visit the Ayatollah in February of 1979 at 5 p.
    m. He was denied access to attorney and detained at the UNESCO Prison in
    Dezful. Trial According to the newspaper report, the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Dezful tried Mr. Ashrafzadeh along with one other. According
    to an electronic form, per request of Mr. Ashrafzadeh, Ayatollah
    Musavi-Tabrizi, the representative of Emam [Khomeini s] Office in Qom,
    went to Dezful to prosecute him. He was tried at the UNESCO Prison in
    Dezful on March 30, 1979 for two days. Charges Kayhan Daily reported Mr.
    Ashrafzadeh s charges together with one other as brutal repression of
    people during the Revolution and anti-people action under the former
    regime. He was also accused of leading a group of hooligans who intruded
    upon Dezful s villagers lives, properties and dignity, and taking over
    their lands by force. According to an electronic form, he was charged with
    disturbing public order and bullying local farmers. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    According to information send by Mr. Ashrafzadeh s relative to Boroumand
    Foundation, the case was based on complaints against the defendants.
    Defense According to the defendant s relative, and due to false
    complaints, the plaintiffs were summoned to court by the order of
    Ayatollah Musavi-Tabrizi. They all announced that they had no complaints
    and had only signed papers [in order to] to receive financial support,
    including salaries from the revolutionary government. They were
    illiterate. Interesting enough, some of these people mentioned how Mr.
    Seyed-Kazem Ashrafzadeh (Seyed Ashrafi) had served them well and
    appreciated him. They indicated that they had no complaints against him
    and felt they owed their lives to his support and services. Judgment
    According to the Kayhan newspaper, the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Dezful recognized Mr. Seyed Kazem Ashrafzadeh guilty of corruption on
    earth and sentenced him to death. According to his relatives, Ayatollah
    Musavi-Tabrizi, the plenipotentiary representative of Emam [Khomeini],
    aquitted Mr. Ashrafzadeh, but revolutionary guards took him from his cell
    and executed him by a firing squad of Revolutionary Guards in the Valiabad
    Cemetery of Dezful on April 8, 1979 at 4:00 a.m.
