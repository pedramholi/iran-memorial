    Whether in his youth in his native Kurdistan in Iraq, or as an adult in
    Iran, where his family immigrated, Mr. Salar Jaff was active and involved
    in politics. He was a man of action and a victim of revolutionary justice.
    Mr. Salar Jaff, son of Davud Beyk (leader of the Jaff tribe) and former
    member of the parliament, is among the seven men whose execution was
    reported by the Pars News Agency on March 5, 1979. The newspapers Kayhan
    (March 5) and Ettela at (March 6, 1979) also published the news.
    Additional information has been drawn from communications sent by Mr. Jaff
    s brother to Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF). Mr. Jaff is also one
    of the 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980, Amnesty International
    report. The report lists defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary
    Tribunals in the period from their inception until August 12, 1979. The
    list of victims and charges is drawn from sources including translations
    of indictments, reports of trials carried out by local and foreign media,
    and the bulletins of the official Pars News Agency reports. Moreover, Mr.
    Jaff is one of 55 persons mentioned in the Memoirs of Ayatollah Khalkhali,
    the first post-revolution religious judge and head of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal. Mr. Salar Jaff, the oldest child of a well-known
    family from the Jaff tribe, was born in Iraq in 1940. His brother refers
    to him as a wise and well-respected person who had the respect of his
    community. Mr. Jaff was active since his youth. He was the representative
    and spokesman of the students at his secondary school and became prominent
    in the small city of Khanaqeen in Iraq. In 1959, unstable conditions and
    insecurity in Iraq led the Jaff family to immigrate to Iran and settle in
    Kermanshah where Mr. Jaff continued his studies. He later on accompanied
    his sick father to Tehran and started agricultural and commercial
    ventures. His modern farming methods drew, according to his brother, the
    attention of visiting foreign delegations. Mr. Jaff was also active
    politically in the Pan-Iranist party and later in the Iran-e Novin party,
    where he was in charge of all Iranian tribes. He was elected as the
    Kermanshah representative to the Majless, Iran's parliament, and served
    his constituency until the revolution. According to his brother, Mr. Jaff
    was also involved in Iraqi politics and supported the Kurdish opposition
    to Iraq's government. He collected medicine and arms for the Pesh Merga
    (the Kurdish militia) and took foreign journalists to Kurdistan so that
    they could witness people's suffering and report on their struggle for
    freedom. Arrest and detention Based on available information, Mr. Salar
    Jaff was arrested soon after the Revolution for his involvement in
    demonstrations in the town of Paveh in Kurdistan. Before the 1979
    revolution, and following a series of widespread demonstrations accross
    Iran, Mr. Jaff organized demonstrations in various cities of Kurdistan to
    support the Shah. During the very last days of these demonstrations in
    Paveh, several people were killed in clashes between the opposition and
    the demonstrators. News of these clashes were reported in the local media,
    as well as in foreing newspapers, such as Der Spiegel and Le Monde.
    According to Mr. Jaff's brother, as the tensions continued, opponents to
    the Shah initiated a campaign of disinformation in the media, and called,
    unsuccessfully, on the parliament to lift Mr. Jaff s immunity. Trial Based
    on news reports, the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Iran was in session
    for nine hours on March 4, 1979, deliberating seven cases, including Mr.
    Jaff s. The specific circumstances of the trial remain unknown. The
    Shari'a Judge and Head of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal, Ayatollah
    Khalkhali, named Mr. Jaff in the list of officials he had tried and noted:
    I believed, and still believe, that all the parliamentarians and senators,
    all governors, heads of SAVAK [National Intelligence and Security
    Organization] and police officers who held office after 1963, and after
    Emam [Khomeini] ordered the boycott [of parliamentary election], should be
    executed. High-ranking officials in the ministries, who were instrumental
    in the survival of the apparatus [Shah s regime] and who would accept any
    humiliation to get close to the Shah and his family, are all condemned [to
    execution] . Charges The charges brought against Mr. Jaff were not
    announced in the report of the Pars News Agency. According to this report,
    the seven co-defendants were collectively charged with participation in
    murder and massacre of innocent people. Kayhan (March 5, 1979), reported
    that Mr. Jaff was arrested for mobilizing vigilantes in Paveh and
    Javanrud, where his followers attacked people and killed the innocents .
    Ayatollah Khalkhali provided details on the charges in his memoirs: I
    began to try the convicts soon after my nomination. All the people who
    were sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Tribunals were the best
    examples of a corruptor on earth, and t
