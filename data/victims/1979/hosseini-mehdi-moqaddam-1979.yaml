    Colonel Moqaddam Hosseini was a family man who spent time with his
    children and encouraged them to read. He respected their intellectual
    independence. He did not break out of prison when rioting took place
    inside, hoping there would be a fair trial where his case would be heard
    and he would be proven innocent. News and information regarding the
    execution of Colonel Mehdi Moqaddam Hosseini was obtained from an
    interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with two
    individuals who knew him (January 24, and 29, 2021). News of Colonel
    Moqaddam Hosseini s execution and that of six other individuals was also
    published in Kayhan (June 2, 1979), and Ayandegan (June 3, 1979)
    newspapers. Additional information was obtained from Ettela at newspaper
    (April 23, and 28, May 14, 29, 30, and 31, and June 4, 1979); Ayandegan
    newspaper (June 10, and 14, 1979); an interview conducted with Mr. Jaber
    Ahmad, political activist and researcher form the city of Ahvaz (April 16,
    2021); documents, including the judgment bearing the signature of the
    Shari a Judge and the then-Islamic Revolution Prosecutor of Ahvaz, a
    certificate signed by the then-Islamic Revolution Prosecutor of Ahvaz, the
    picture of Colonel Moqaddam Hosseini s body; and other documents and
    sources.* According to available information, Colonel Moqaddam Hosseini
    was born on April 17, 1930, in Tehran in a low income family. He was
    married and had two daughters and a hearing impaired son. Colonel Moqaddam
    Hosseini graduated from the Officers Training University, and went on to
    Fort Sill military base in the U.S. state of Oklahoma to continue his
    education. He served in the Army [Ground Forces] in Esfahan, and at the
    Army Headquarters in Lavizan [then just outside Tehran]. He was very
    motivated and hard-working and climbed up the military ladder very
    quickly. He was transferred to the city of Ahvaz in 1976, along with his
    family, to serve as commander of the Khuzestan 92ndArtillery Armored
    Division in order to fulfill [service] outside Tehran and reach the rank
    of brigadier-general; he took up residence in Army housing there.
    (Boroumand Center interviews, January 24, and 29, 2021; documents).
    Colonel Moqaddam Hosseini was a kind, polite, honest, handsome, and
    well-dressed family man. He liked mountain climbing, cycling, and
    basketball, and pursued swimming and volleyball professionally. He
    organized a volleyball team in every base he served and encouraged his
    soldiers to exercise. Colonel Moqaddam Hosseini spent his free time with
    his family. He was a Moslem but respected his children s opinions and
    encouraged them to read and study. Colonel Moqaddam Hosseini would
    distribute his allotment of food given to him by the Army, in poor
    neighborhoods. (Boroumand Center interviews, January 24, and 29, 2021). In
    the months culminating in the February 1979 Revolution, Colonel Moqaddam
    Hosseini was Deputy Commander of Ahvaz Military Command, and tried very
    hard during the demonstrations to avoid clashes and bloodshed between
    protesters and military forces. (Boroumand Center interviews, January 24,
    2021). The Events of Khuzestan from the Onset of the Revolution Until June
    1979 One month after the February 1979 Islamic Revolution, the fall of the
    armed forces, and the challenges facing the newly-installed central
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini wrote a letter to Ayatollah Mohammad Taher
    Al Shobair Khaghani, political and religious leader of Khuzestan s ethnic
    Arabs, on February 20, 1979, in which he mandated him with the mission of
    establishing committees in order to restore order in the region. Ayatollah
    Shobair Khaghani was considered an influential cleric in the region and
    even had supporters and followers in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait,
    and Qatar. He was also among those who did not think it was right for the
    clergy to directly interfere in governmental affairs . Following Ayatollah
    Khomeini s request, he established committees made up of the region s
    Arabs and tribes, which later came to be known as The Moslem Arab People
    of Iran s Political Organization . (Boroumand Center research; Imam
    Khomeini Portal, February 20, 1979; Ayandegan newspaper, June 10, 1979).
    At the same time, a group of Arab activists founded cultural centers in
    various towns in Khuzestan province. Certain factions were not pleased,
    however, with the establishment of independent committees comprised of
    Arabs and with the formation of cultural centers: A group of
    revolutionaries close to Ayatollah Khomeini started The [city of]
    Khorramshahr Cultural Military Center , as a parallel institution to the
    aforementioned groups. On April 16, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini s supporters
    conducted a sit-in at Khorramshahr s Great Mosque demanding general
    disarmament and the dissolution of unofficial [and unauthorized] centers
    and organizations in Khuzestan.** (Boroumand Center research; interview
