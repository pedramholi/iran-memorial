    General Nematollah Nasiri is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980
    Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. The news of the execution of General Nasiri, along with
    three other high ranking military officials, is also announced in a
    communiqué of the Special Islamic Tribunal (Kayhan daily, 17 February
    1979) General Nasiri is also mentioned in the Memoirs of Ayatollah
    Khalkhali, the first post-revolution religious judge and head of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals: "I began to try the culprits soon after
    my nomination. The first people I tried and punished for their deeds were
    Nematollah Nasiri, head of SAVAK, and .... I sentenced them to death. ...
    All the people who were sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Tribunals
    were the best examples of 'corruptor on earth' and they were executed as
    such." "A Corruptor on earth is a person who contributes to spreading and
    expanding corruption on earth. Corruption is what leads to the decline,
    destruction and deviation of society from its natural path. People who
    were executed had strived in spreading corruption and prostitution,
    circulating heroin, opium and licentious behavior, atheism, murder,
    betrayal, flattery; in sum, they had all these vile traits. These people’s
    problems were aggravated by the fact that they did not repent once they
    saw the people’s revolution." "To sum it up, all the people that I
    condemned and who were executed in the early days of the establishment of
    the Revolutionary Tribunals and later in the Qasr prison were all
    corruptor on earth and based on the Quran judgment their blood was a
    waste." Arrest and detention No information is available on the
    defendant's arrest and detention. However, photographs published in the
    press show the defendant with bandages covering his head and chin. Trial
    The defendant and 24 other individuals were tried in the Alavi School. The
    Kayhan daily reported that these defendants were tried following an order
    issued by Ayatollah Khomeini on February 15th. The trial lasted 10 hours.
    The report specified that the defendants, (brought in together and having
    each a name tag consisting of a large sheet of paper taped on their
    chests) were tried by a group composed of " three reputable judges, the
    representative of the Imam [Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali], Edalati, a member
    of the Jame'eye Ruhaniun-e Mobarez (Association of Combatant Clerics), and
    Dr. Yazdi, a member of the Revolutionary Council [A temporary
    revolutionary ruling body whose members were nominated by Ayatollah
    Khomeini]." The accused were spread out in the courtroom. The presence of
    prosecution witnesses is noted but there is no reference to defense
    witnesses. Behind General Nasiri, A photograph in Kayhan shows a scripture
    [verse from the Qur'an] : " In the Name of the Destroyer of Oppressors.
    The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Iran. And for you in the Law of
    Talion [Qisas] there is life, O ye men of Understanding! If a man kills a
    Believer intentionally, his recompense is hell, to abide therein Forever.
    If anyone slew a person, it would be as if he slew the whole people".
    Charges The charges against General Nasiri as listed in the Special
    Islamic Tribunal's communiqué are: corruption on earth, massacre of
    people, torture, and treason. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available regarding the evidence presented against this defendant. The
    report of the trial mentioned the presence of witnesses testifying in
    support of the prosecutors but provides no information regarding their
    testimony. Based on the statements of the presiding judge regarding this
    execution [published in Sadeq Khalkhali's memoirs, Volume I], the
    defendant's association with the former regime after the year 1963 was
    also regarded as incriminating evidence against him: "I believed at the
    time, and I still believe, that all the deputies and senators, all
    governors, heads of SAVAK [former regime's political police] and police,
    who after 1963, and the Imam's boycott [referring to the period starting
    with Ayatollah Khomeini's arrest and conviction following the 1963
    protests against the Shah's social and political reforms], held office are
    all sentenced to death. Directors in ministries who were instrumental in
    the survival of the apparatus [Shah’s regime] and who, for getting close
    to the Shah and his family would accept any humiliation, are all
    condemned. Defense No information is available regarding General Nasiri's
    defense. Kayhan's report of the trial, which does not mention any
    statement by the defendant or the other officials tried that day, notes
    that the accused were "bombarded with thousands of questions." There were
    no defense witnesses. However,
