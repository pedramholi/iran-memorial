    The execution of Mr. Eshrat Rusta’i and three others was reported by the
    correspondents of the Enqelab Eslami and Kayhan dailies in Malayer
    (September 13, 1979). Arrest and detention Based on the reports, a group
    of 40 Police and Islamic Revolutionary Committee Guards were involved in
    arresting the defendant and eight other alleged smugglers. Trial Mr.
    Rusta’i’s trial, headed by a religious judge, was reportedly held in the
    presence of a large number of people at the amphitheatre of Dr. Shari’ati
    High School in Malayer. The session was held at night and, based on Kayhan
    , trial and deliberations took 5 hours. Charges Based on the Kayhan
    report, Mr. Rusta’i was "part of a drug trafficking band equipped for
    producing and distributing heroin." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Evidence of guilt Based on the Kayhan
    report, the defendant and the other members of the band were found in
    possession of 14 kilograms and 625 grams of heroin, some arms and bullets,
    and some carbonate and heroin laboratory devices. Defense No information
    is available on the defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    of Malayer sentenced Mr. Rusta’i to death. He was executed at dawn,
    shortly after the issuance of the verdict.
