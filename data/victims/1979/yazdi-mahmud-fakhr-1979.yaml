    Mr. Mahmud Fakhr Yazdi is one of 438 victims listed in a 13 March 1980
    Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media, and the bulletins of the official Pars
    News Agency reports. The story of his execution along with two others was
    also published in Keyhan Daily on 23 April 1979. According to Keyhan
    Daily, Mr. Fakhr was a cleric, professor at the university, and a member
    of Mashhad Council. (Keyhan) Arrest and detention No information regarding
    the defendant's arrest and detention is available. Trial Mr. Fakhr`s trial
    along with Mr. Imanifar and Mr. Atashi were the first session of
    Revolutionary Tribunal in Mashhad. The trial took place in the former Hall
    of Rastakhiz Party in Mashhad and according to Keyhan Daily, with the
    presence of 500 of the victims` families of the Pahlavi Regime. Charges
    According to Keyhan Daily, he was convicted of collaborating with the
    political police SAVAK and propaganda on behalf of the former regime. He
    was also convicted of consuming alcoholic beverages and sodomy according
    to the Revolutionary Prosecutor`s indictment. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available on the evidence presented against Mr. Fakhr. Defense No
    information is available regarding the defense of the accused or whether
    he was able to defend himself. For example, if he could cross check the
    witnesses or was enjoying the legal assistance of a lawyer. Judgment The
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashhad found Mr. Fakhr and the two other
    defendants guilty of mass murder, repression, and corruption on earth and
    sentenced them to death; however, it is not clear what the individual
    verdict for Mr. Fakhr was or if there was one. He was executed by shooting
    at dawn of 23 April 1979 along with two others (Kayhan).
