    This unnamed security officer in Kerman is one of 438 victims listed in a
    March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants
    who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their
    inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn
    from sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials
    carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official

    charges against the defendant, as listed in the Amnesty International
    report, are: murder of persons, murder of young children, murder of
    religious leaders. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available regarding the defense of the accused. Judgment The defendant was
    sentenced to death and executed. No other details are available.
