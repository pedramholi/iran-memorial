    Mr. Bijan Afrasyabi, former governor of Birjand, is one of 438 victims
    listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists
    defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period
    from their inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges
    is drawn from sources including translations of indictments, reports of
    trials carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the
    official Pars News Agency reports. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic s authorities have executed individuals on trumped up charges
    such as drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact
    number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest
    and detention No information regarding the defendant's arrest and
    detention is available. Trial Amnesty International's report on this
    execution contains no information regarding the defendant's identity or

    Amnesty International report, are: corruption on earth; war on God; war on
    God's prophet and the deputy Imam Zaman, war against the representative of

    killings; member of the past regime; plunder of national treasury,
    embezzlement of public funds; mobilising "stick wielding ruffians,"
    participating in threats and terrorism against just people. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.

    against Governor Afrasyabi. Defense No information is available regarding
