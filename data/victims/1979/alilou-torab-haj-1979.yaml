    Mr. Torab Hajalilou is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980
    Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have executed individuals on trumped up charges such as drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The report
    provides no information on the arrest and detention of the defendant.
    Trial The Kayhan correspondent's report of the defendant's 6-hour-trial
    from Ardebil reads as follows: The trial of the accused of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Ardebil, Haj Alilu, the former Head of the
    town’s SAVAK started and members of families of martyrs and various
    classes of Ardebil attended. First, the indictment of the Prosecutor
    against the defendant, causing suffocation, arresting and imprisoning
    freedom fighters, undue interference in administrative and municipal,
    organizing attacks by stick wielding ruffians, leaving the town’s
    responsibility to people who tried to please the former Shah, and indecent
    acts was read. Then, Haj Alilou defended himself by noting that he was
    innocent and that arrests were made based on order sent by the
    headquarters. The trial lasted 6 hours following which the Court’s members
    deliberated, convicted the accused as a corruptor on earth and a traitor
    to the nation, sentenced him to death. The sentence was carried out.
    Charges The charges against Mr. Hajalilou as listed in the Amnesty
    International report and Kayhan daily are: corruption on earth, being a
    traitor to the nation and acting against the security of the nation. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available on the evidence presented
    against Mr. Hajalilou. Defense No information is available regarding the
    defense of the accused. Judgment The defendant's case was reported by
    Reuters on April 9th. Amnesty notes that Mr. Hajalilou had been found not
    guilty of torture, preventing people [from] attending prayers, working
    against Islamic principles and taking away poeples' rights. He was
    however, found guilty of acting against the security of the nation and
    executed.
