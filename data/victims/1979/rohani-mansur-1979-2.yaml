    Minister to the Shah in matters of Energy (water and power) and
    Agriculture. Mr. Mansur Rohani is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13,
    1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. The case of Mr. Rohani is also mentioned in the Memoirs of
    Ayatollah Khalkhali, the first post-revolution religious judge and head of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals. Mr. Khalkhali includes the name of
    Mr. Rohani in a list of people close to the former regime against whom he
    issued a death sentence. Arrest and detention No information regarding the
    defendant's arrest and detention is available. Trial Amnesty
    International's report on this execution contains no information regarding
    the defendant's trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Rohani were
    : "corruption on earth; treason, destroying agriculture and forests". More
    specifically Khalkhali mentions the defendant's charges in the following
    terms: "Rohani, one of the Ministers, who was apparently the Minister of
    Energy, and had destroyed 40 villages in Khuzestan". As for the charge of
    "corruption on earth", the religious judge defines it as: "A Corruptor on
    earth is a person who contributes to spreading and expanding corruption on
    earth. Corruption is what leads to the decline, destruction and deviation
    of society from its natural path. People who were executed had strived in
    spreading corruption and prostitution, circulating heroin, opium and
    licentious behavior, atheism, murder, betrayal, flattery; in sum, they had
    all these vile traits. These people s problems were aggravated by the fact
    that they did not repent once they saw the people s revolution."
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have executed
    individuals on trumped up charges such as drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available regarding the defense of the accused. Judgment
    The religious judge found the defendant guilty. In his Memoirs Khalkhali
    explains the verdict in the following terms: "To sum it up, all the people
    that I condemned and who were executed in the early days of the
    establishment of the Revolutionary Tribunals and later in the Qasr prison
    were all corruptor on earth and based on the Qur'an judgment their blood
    was a waste." .
