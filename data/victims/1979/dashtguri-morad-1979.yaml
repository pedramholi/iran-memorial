circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Morad Dashtguri and another individual from the
    Mazare’i village was reported by the correspondent of the Pars News Agency
    in Bushehr. The Kayhan daily of August 29, 1979 published the report. This
    execution was also reported in the Enqelab Eslami daily of September 1,
    1979. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges Mr. Dashtguri was accused of adultery. Evidence
    of guilt The reports of this execution do not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on the defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Bushehr (also referred to in the Kayhan report
    as the Shari’a Court of Bushehr) sentenced Mr. Dashtguri to death.
