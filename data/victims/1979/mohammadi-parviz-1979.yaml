    News of the execution of Mr. Parviz Mohammadi is published in the Kayhan

    electronic form sent to Omid by a person familiar with his case. According
    to the existing information, Mr. Parviz Mohammadi, 42, was married and is
    from Behbud in Zanjan. He was the Deputy Chief of Borujerd SAVAK (SAVAK
    being the secret state police during the time of the Shah). Mr. Parviz
    Mohammadi is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980, Amnesty
    International report. The report lists defendants who were convicted by
    revolutionary tribunals in the period from their inception until August
    12, 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from sources which
    include translations of indictments, reports of trials carried out by
    local and foreign media, and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of Mr. Mohammadi s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial According to the Kayhan newspaper, the
    third session of the Borujerd Islamic Revolutionary Court convened to
    investigate charges brought against Mr. Parviz Mohammadi. After reciting
    from the Qur an, the court session began in the presence of 300 people,
    including plaintiffs and witnesses at the City Hall. First, the Public
    Prosecutor read the indictment against the defendant in 74 cases and asked
    the judge to condemn him to death on three counts. After seven hours of
    prosecution, investigation, and deliberation, the court found the
    defendant guilty and condemned him to death for murder. Charges The charge
    against Mr. Mohammadi, according to the Amnesty report, was: massacre
    during demonstrations, causing death to unnamed persons during
    demonstration. According to the Kayhan newspaper, the charges against Mr.
    Parviz Mohammadi were announced as murdering Mohammad Qalebi, 14, and Ali
    Bayat, 28. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not
