    The execution of Mr. Gholam Reza Hommadpur Behzad, known as Reza the Turk,
    was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on July 14, 1979. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No detailed information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. He was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran.
    According to the newspaper, the court deliberations lasted for hours.
    Charges Mr. Mohammadpur Behzad was charged with “sodomy with children
    under 12 years of age, establishment of casinos, and promotion of sedition
    and collection of unlawful interest”. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution refers to his “explicit confession”. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense No information is available on his defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Mr. Gholam Reza Mohammadpur
    Behzad to death. He was execuited, along with two other individuals, at 1
    a.m. on July 13, 1979 in Tehran.
