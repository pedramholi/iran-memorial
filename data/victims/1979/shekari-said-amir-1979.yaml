    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and other Latin American guerrilla
    movements, and with a commitment to waging urban warfare, was founded in
    1971 from the merger of two Communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi
    regime. In 1981 the organization, which after the Revolution had opted for
    open political and electoral activity, split over the issues of armed
    struggle (with one faction negating and disavowing it) and support for the
    Islamic Republic and the Soviet Union. Three separate branches came into
    existence: the FKO Majority, FKO Minority, and FKO Guerrilla Organization.
    The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization Majority considered the Islamic Republic a
    revolutionary and anti-imperialist regime, and supported it until early
    1983. From then on, members of this Party were subjected to attacks and
    suppression by the Islamic Republic solely on the basis of their political
    beliefs. Burning of Bookstores Months before the 1979 Islamic revolution,
    certain Islamic groups and individuals, particularly supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini, the Leader of the Revolution, began attacking
    entertainment centers and bookstores. These activiti
