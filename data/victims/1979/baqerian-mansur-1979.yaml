    The executions of Mr. Mansur Baqerian and three other persons were
    reported in the Kayhan and the Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on July 12, 1979.
    Mr. Baqerian is also one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty
    International report. The report lists defendants who were convicted by
    Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception until 12 August
    1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from sources including
    translations of indictments, reports of trials carried out by local and
    foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News Agency reports.
    Arrest and detention No information is available regarding his arrest and
    detention. Trial According to Kayhan , Branch One of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran held several sessions in proceedings of
    Mr. Baqerian s case and three other persons . Charges Kayhan announced the
    charges brought against Mr. Baqerian as follows: he played an active role
    in the shameful coup of August 19 [1953], and on that date, he was the
    editor of the Shafaq newspaper and wrote articles opposing the late Dr.
    Mosadeq and the combatants of truth, justice, and Islam; he also published
    articles to invigorate and strengthen the idolatrous monarchist regime.
    Additionally, he established brothels in Sanandaj and Tehran, produced and
    imported pornographic films in order to pervert and corrupt youth; [he is
    accused of] repeated counts of adultery with many women, and of raping
    girls and women while promising them acting careers in the film industry.
    He imported sex stimulant drugs and sex toys, and held gatherings in order
    to bring together lustful persons, had connections with Israel, entered
    contracts with Israel, and imported pornographic films in order to delude
    the youth. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The Kayhan report stated that Mr. Baqerian
    traveled to Israel several times and that the police had discovered his
    letters and contracts in both Hebrew and English, and addresses of hotels
    and residences that he visited in Israel. Jomhuri Eslami added that
    several rolls of film and slides, and hundreds of photographs were also
    discovered, which depicted him with women and girls. The latter report
    also referred to the defendants confessions. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense No information is available regarding the defense. Judgment
    The Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran called Mr. Baqerian a corruptor on
    earth and condemned him to death. She and three other persons were
    executed by firing squad in Qasr prison on July 12, 1980.
