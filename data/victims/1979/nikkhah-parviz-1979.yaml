    Mr. Parvis Nikkhah is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980
    Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. Additional information was provided via electronic form.
    He was born in Tehran in 1932, and held a Bachelor of Science degree in
    Physics from the University of Manchester. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Nikkhah was arrested by gunmen in his home, in the presence of his wife
    and children. No further information is available on his arrest and
    detention. Trial Mr. Nikkhah’s trial was very brief. The trial, judgment,
    and execution took three days. Charges According to the Amnesty
    International report, Mr. Nikkhah was charged with corruption on earth.
    The report notes that Mr. Nikkhah was the author of a letter slandering
    Ayatollah Khomeini, published in the daily Ettela’at in January 1978. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available on the evidence presented against Mr. Parviz
    Nikkhah. Defense No information is available regarding the defense of the
    accused. Judgment The details of the execution verdict are not known. Mr.
    Parviz Nikkhah was condemned to death and executed on March 13, 1979.
