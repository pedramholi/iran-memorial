    Introduction The execution of Prof. Jamshid A lam was reported in the
    Kayhan Daily, 24 September 1979. From 19-24 September, Kayhan reported on
    the trial of the three defendants. Additional information regarding this
    case was collected from Mr. Mohsen Khadjehnouri s case by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation (ABF) and an interview with Dr. Heidarqoli Boroumand
    (Foundation for Iranian Studies, 6 August 1985), Kayhan Daily (17 June
    1979), Aftab Website (17 August 2007), Ayatollah Falsafi s Memoir (pages
    232-238: Fars News, 8 February 2004). Iranian National Radio also declared
    Prof. A lam s execution on 24 September 1979. Prof. A lam was a senator
    for four terms and also was a Member of Parliament under the Shah Regime.
    He had a medical degree specializing in Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) from
    the University of Lyon in France. He was the Shah s doctor, and the head
    of Farabi and Amir A lam Hospitals in Tehran. There are still some books
    by him in the Library of the University of Tehran (Aftab, 17 August 1979,
    Kayhan, 18 August 1979). It is noteworthy that Prof. A lam s name was
    indexed in a list of people whose properties were confiscated. On 17 June
    1979, Kayhan Daily published a list of 54 people whose bank accounts
    including checking and saving accounts and other deposits were blocked by
    the Revolutionary government (Kayhan, 17 June 1979). Arrest and detention
    Prof. A lam was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards between the 28thand
    30thof April 1979 and surrendered to Qasr Prison (Kayhan, 30 April 1979).
    (According to Dr. Heidar Qoli Boroumand who was his cellmate for a short
    time, Prof. A lam was jailed in Temporary Ward No. 2 of this prison. This
    ward was a large corridor which had a number of cells. In his cell,
    approximately 35 inmates were kept. The condition of Qasr Prison was very
    poor. There were lice in some of the cells, and appropriate medical care
    was not provided. Many cells did not have showers (interview with Dr.
    Boroumand, 6 August 1985). Ayatollah Khalkhali, a religious judge, used to
    go to the wards and select prisoners randomly for execution. Prof. A lam
    lost his hopes. A person in his cell, with an unknown intention, was
    harassing him by saying today, they are executing senators! (Interview
    with Dr. Boroumand, 6 August 1985). The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    the Center held four sessions in three days to examine the case of Prof. A
    lam and two other defendants. It was the first trial of the Revolutionary
    Tribunal of the Center after its establishment. The sum of the four
    sessions of the court was not more than ten hours and only one third of it
    was allocated to Prof. A lam (Kayhan, 19, 20, 22 and 24 September 1979).
    According to the information available in the case of Mr. Khadjehnouri who
    was tried in the same court and under similar conditions, his trial was
    closed and their relatives were not allowed in (Mr. Khadjenuri s case,
    ABF). Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center held four
    sessions in three days to examine the case of Prof. A lam and two other
    defendants. It was the first trial of the Revolutionary Tribunal of the
    Center after its establishment. The sum of the four sessions of the court
    was not more than ten hours and only one third of it was allocated to
    Prof. A lam (Kayhan, 19, 20, 22 and 24 September 1979). According to the
    information available in the case of Mr. Khadjehnouri who was tried in the
    same court and under similar conditions, his trial was closed and their
    relatives were not allowed in (Mr. Khadjenuri s case, ABF). Charges
    According to Kayhan Daily, his charges were described as follows in the
    prosecutor s indictment: He was accused of being sellout to the Pahlavi
    Regime and betraying the oppressed people he cowardly ruined the culture
    and honor of our nation by passing anti-people acts. He actively
    participated in passing the Capitulation Act. (Kayhan, 19 September 1979)
    According to Kayhan Daily, the indictment also provided that {Prof. A lam}
    had a close relationship with General Nasiri (1), and after the expulsion
    of Iranian residents from Iraq by the Iraqi government (2), he criticized
    Ayatollah Khomeini harshly (Kayhan, 19 September 1979). Prof. A lam
    referred to Khomeini without naming him as the clergies who do not
    cooperate with Shah and criticized him. This speech was protested by
    Ayatollah Falsafi and as a result he was barred from giving speech in
    public (Ayatollah Falsafi s Memoir). The indictment continued; in
    addition, he was enjoying all the privileges of the Shah s Court (Kayhan,
    19 September 1979). The prosecutor also accused the defendant of voting
    for the former regime s proposals and bills. According to the prosecutor s
    indictment, he stated in the interrogations that he agreed with the bills
    made by the government, because they were selected by Shah. He was also
    convicted of connection to Sha ban Ja fari (one of the Shah s claimed
    elements). Allegedly when Sha ban Ja fari was making unrest and fraud in
    an election in Qa
