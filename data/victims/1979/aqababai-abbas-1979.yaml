circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Abbas Aqababa’i was reported by the correspondent of
    the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper in Mashhad (November 19, 1979). Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the trial. Charges The
    defendant was charged with torture and assault and battery, rape, and
    creating terror. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashhad declared Mr.
    Aqababa’i a “corruptor on earth” and an “enemy of God” and sentenced him
    to death. He was executed at dawn in Mashhad on November 17, 1979.
