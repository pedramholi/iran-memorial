    In Parliament, Mr. Khajenuri provided a medical dispensary and clean water
    for his district. He would later defend Iranian Freemasonry as part of a
    tradition including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The execution
    of Mr. Mohsen Khajenuri was reported by Kayhan Daily on September 24th
    1979. Additional information about this case was similarly drawn from
    Kayhan in 1979; dates including the19th-22nd of September and the 20th of
    March. Information about the case of Mr. Khajenuri was completed by a
    person close to him. Mr. Khajenuri, born in Tehran, was 62 years old. He
    had obtained a doctorate degree in economics from a university in
    Switzerland. He was elected in 1963 as a representative of Shemiranat,
    Tehran, in the 21st Parliament and resigned in 1973 to run for the Senate.
    He held different positions such as the Executive Director of Social
    Insurance for Workers, Senior Advisor to the Ministry of Labor, and one of
    the founders of Hezb Novin Iran (New Party of Iran) which was a political
    party under the Shah s regime (Kayhan, 20 March 1979, the Research Center
    of Majles and information received from an individual close to him). The
    New Party of Iran was established in 1963, but after the Shah declared a
    one-party system in 1974, it merged into the Rastakhiz Party. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Khajenuri was arrested on 19 March 1979 by the Islamic
    Revolutionary Committee of the Third Circuit of Tehran and was surrendered
    to Qasr Prison in Tehran. He was detained for some time at Qasr where he
    was allowed weekly visits by relatives. Later he was transferred to Evin
    Prison. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center (i.e.
    Tehran) held four sessions to examine the case of Mr. Khajenuri and two
    other defendants. They were tried in camera and their relatives were not
    allowed in. The trial took place in the Evin Prison. Charges The charges
    brought against the defendant were : "having been the executive director
    of the construction and development company Shemiran-e No"; "having been
    the technical director of the Ministry of Labor"; "having been the
    executive director of Workers' Social Security Organization"; "having been
    one of the founders of the anti-nationalist party Iran Novin"; "having
    supported the 1953 coup d'etat (that toppled the government of Prime
    Minister Mossadeq)"; "embezzlement of public funds while he was serving as
    a legislator"; "spreading corruption, partying and drinking with Pahlavi's
    family"; "having been a Freemason". He was also accused of having assigned
    the villagers' land to the royal hunting domain and national ski resorts.
    The prosecutor accused the defendant of firing unjustly an employee of the
    Social Security Organization in 1967. Evidence of guilt The evidence
    mentioned by the prosecutor consisted of a complaint filed by 28 villagers
    and the testimony of the employee of the Social Security Organization. The
    religious judge did not allow the defendant to list his services to his
    constituency while he served as a legislator. The defendant was not
    allowed to summon witnesses who volunteered to testify in his favor; they
    were not allowed in the courtroom. Defense Mr. Khajenuri and the two other
    defendants were not allowed to hire a lawyer. Mr. Khajenuri firmly denied
    the charges of embezzlement. He said he had only received his salary as a
    representative of the people and nothing more. He mentioned his services
    to his constituency: he had personally funded the construction of a
    medical dispensary for the villagers, and he had provided the villages
    with clean drinking water. All his wealth, he said, was inherited from his
    father and his mother. As for being a Freemason, the defendant reminded
    the court that national figures such as Jamaledin Asadabadi, Nasrollah
    Taqavi and Mohamad Mosadeq were Freemasons in Iran. Around the world, he
    added, Freemasons had always fought for freedom. People like Washington
    and Jefferson who fought for the independence of their country were
    Freemasons. He said he was against communism because communists are
    against democracy and that is why he joined the Freemasonry, the only
    organization capable to counter communism. As for his alleged support of
    the 1953 coup, the defendant reminded the court that he was serving the
    Prime Minister Mossadeq at the time of the coup and he was the architect
    of the creation of the Workers Social Security Organization. After the
    coup, he explained, he resigned in protest and was banned from public life
    for eight years. The defendant also dismissed the charges of removing the
    villagers from their land, by reminding that he had no authority to do so.
    The royal hunting domain was managed by the Court Ministry, and the Ski
    Federation was in charge of the skiing domain. A Summary of the Legal
    Defects in the Adjudication of Mr. Mohsen Khajenuri s Case According to
    available information, the basis for all of the charges brought against
    Mr. Khajenuri was the positions he held under the Pahlavi regime [such as
    Senator]
