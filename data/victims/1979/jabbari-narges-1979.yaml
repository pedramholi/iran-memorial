    is among the very first women executed following the Islamic Revolution in
    Iran. News of the execution of Mrs. Narges Jabbari, child of Fatemeh Nesa
    and Ahmad, was published in Keyhan newspaper on August 22, 1979.
    Additional information about this execution was obtained through
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center interview with Mr. Jabbari s family s
    attorney who was a member of the Iranian Jurists Association 1 on February
    28, 2019 (ABC interview), Jomhuri-e Eslami newspaper (August 25, 1979),
    Ettela at newspaper (October 7 and 24, 1979), and an article by Mr. Iraj
    Mesdaqi on the Neither Living Nor Dead website on September 3, 2009. Mrs.
    Jabbari was born in 1961 in the city of Behshahr, Mazandaran Province.
    Mrs. Jabbari was married and at the time of execution, she was under 18
    years old (Keyhan newspaper). International laws have strictly prohibited
    capital punishment for those who were under the age of 18 at the time of
    committing a crime. As a party to the International Covenant on Civil and
    Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has
    the obligation not to impose capital punishment for an offence committed
    before the age of eighteen. In response to the news of Ms. Jabbari s
    execution, Ayatollah Khomeini said: maybe she got what she deserved. Ms.
    Jabbari s case was related to sexual crimes in the city of Behshahr in
    1979. Arrest and detention According to the attorney of Mrs. Jabbari s
    family, the local residents reported that Mrs. Jabbari was arrested before
    noon on August 21, 1979 in the street in the city of Behshahr (ABC
    interview). The circumstances of Mrs. Jabbari s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal in Behshahr tried Mrs.
    Jabbari in one session (Jomhuri-e Eslami newspaper). Charges The charges
    brought against Ms. Jabbari were adultery(2) and illicit relationship with
    a 22-year- old man (Keyhan and Jomhuri-e Eslami newspapers). The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Ms. Jabbari was under 18 years old at the time of execution.
    Evidence of guilt According to available information, the explicit
    confession made by Ms. Jabbari was used against her (Jomhuri-e Eslami
    newspapers). Defense According to the attorney of Mrs. Jabbari s family,
    the local residents reported him that: the girl (Mrs. Jabbari) was
    arrested, taken, and killed . The local residents also claimed that in her
    childhood, Mrs. Jabbari had fallen from a height, which had caused her
    mental illness, and the accusation was false (ABC interview). No
    information is available on Ms. Jabbari s defense. A summary of the
    defects of Ms. Narges Jabari s Legal Proceedings The following defects can
    be observed from the procedure and implementation of the sentence issued
    against Ms. Jabbari: 1) Adultery was not defined as a criminal offence in
    governing law at the time of the issuance of the sentence (the General
    Penal Code, and the Law on Amending for Articles 207 to 214 of the General
    Penal Code(3)). In addition, according to the law, misdemeanors and crimes
    against public chastity and marital responsibilities , were not punished
    by execution. Therefore, the issuance and implementation of the death
    sentence against Ms. Jabbari was obviously in contradiction with the
    principle of legality. According to the testimony of local residents, Ms.
    Jabbari had fallen from height which caused her mental illness and legal
    incapability. 2) The fact that Ms. Jabbari was under the age of 18 at the
    time when she was arrested, tried, and executed, was never taken into
    consideration by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal in Behshahr. 3) There
    were serious doubts regarding Ms. Jabbari s mental health, and the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal in Behshahr had not conducted any investigations in
    this regard. 4) According to local residents, Mrs. Jabbari was tried right
    after she was arrested, and the sentence was carried out immediately. This
    is in clear contradiction with her rights to defense, including the right
    to access to a lawyer, the right to visit and contact her family, the
    right to adequate time and facilities for the preparation of the defense,
    the right to request for a medical examination and obtain a medical
    report, the right to appeal to a court of higher jurisdiction and the
    right to seek pardon or commutation of sentence. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal in Behshahr sentenced Ms. Nar
