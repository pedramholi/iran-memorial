    The news of the trial and execution of Major General Molavi along with 5
    other defendants, was published in the Kayhan daily on April 4, 1979.
    Furthermore, information regarding this execution was sent to Omid by
    electronic forms by individuals familiar with Major General Molavi
    Taleqani’s case. According to the forms, Major General Molavi Taleqani was
    the chief of police of the Pahlavi regime in Tehran and a father of 4.
    Major General Mohammad Javad Molavi Taleqani is also one of 438 victims
    listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists
    defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period
    from their inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges
    is drawn from sources including translations of indictments, reports of
    trials carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the
    official Pars News Agency reports. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic’s authorities have executed individuals on trumped up charges
    such as drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact
    number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest
    and detention According to the information present on the electronic form,
    Major General Molavi Taleqani was not arrested by the authorities. Rather,
    he willingly went to the Committee and identified himself. There is no
    available information with regard to his detention. Trial The newspaper
    report mentions that 6 officers of the Imperial military were tried
    together at the 1st and 4th branches of Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary
    court on April 3, 1979. Major General Molavi Taleqani’s and another
    defendant’s files were reviewed by the 4th branch. The trial, including
    deliberations, for all the defendants lasted 15 hours. There was no appeal
    process for any of the defendants. Charges The charge against Major
    General Molavi Taleqani, as listed in the Amnesty International report,
    is: mass murder, massacre of innocent people. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available on the evidence presented against Major General
    Molavi Taleghani. Defense No information is available regarding the
    defense of the accused. Judgment According to the newspaper, Major General
    Molavi Taleqani and the other defendants were sentenced to death. This
    verdict was announced at 1 a.m. April 4, 1979. He was executed at the Qasr
    Prison in Tehran.
