    Mr. Daoud Samadi (alias Dr. Alai), chief of the strike branch of the joint
    anti-sabotage committee in Mashad and its patrol units, is one of 438
    victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The
    report lists defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in
    the period from their inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims
    and charges is drawn from sources including translations of indictments,
    reports of trials carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins
    of the official Pars News Agency reports. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic’s authorities have executed individuals on trumped up charges
    such as drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact
    number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest
    and detention No information regarding the defendant's arrest and
    detention is available. Trial Amnesty International's report on this
    execution contains no information regarding the defendant's identity or
    trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Samadi, according to the Amnesty
    report, were: hostility to friends of God; beatings resulting in death,
    torture resulting in death; torture (physical); ordering troops to fire,
    sending in troops. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    on the evidence presented against Mr. Samadi. Defense No information is
    available on the defence. Judgment The defendant was sentenced to death
    and executed. No further information is available.
