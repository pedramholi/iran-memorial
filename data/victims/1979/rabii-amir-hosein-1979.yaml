    Lt. General Hossein Rabii is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980
    Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have executed individuals on trumped up charges such as drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention No
    information regarding the defendant's arrest and detention is available.
    Trial Amnesty International's report on this execution contains no
    information regarding the defendant's identity or trial. Charges ُThe
    charges against Lt. General Rabii, as listed by Amnesty International,
    are: corruption on earth; war on God and the people of God; actions
    designed to weaken the country's independence and security; shaking the
    foundations of the country's system of government; participating directly
    in the murder of innocent people and trying to put down the people's
    uprising; defiling all that is sacred, whether religious or national, to
    the Muslim people of Iran and the world; dismissing air force officers and
    having them killed in an attempt to attempt to oppose the people's desire
    for rule; insulting the pure clergy and trying to discredit them by
    calling them Communists; trying to influence the opinions of soldiers and
    homafars [air force personnel â Amnesty International note] and thereby
    lead them astray from the true path; trying to hinder the air force in its
    desire to join forces with the people; subjecting the army, the politics,
    economy and culture of the country to the influence of foreigners and
    imperialism; trying to re-establish the Shah's idolatrous rule over the
    weak and defenceless people; conspiracy, incitement and attempting to
    obstruct the path of God to deprive the people of their true desire.
    Source: Ettela'at (Tehran) 11 April 1979. Part two of Lt. General Rabi'i's
    indictment (a brief description of the evidence) was reported by local
    correspondents on 11 April to have read as follows: (4) “ The arrest of
    dissident air force personnel, the eviction of some of them from their
    homes (provided by the air force), according to the testimony of Generals
    Hashem Berenjian and Sepahbod Kamyabipour, preventing the revolutionary
    flight (of Ayatollah Khomeini) according to his own confession as recorded
    in his file, and trying to prevent the Ayatollah's return, making
    facilities available to General Gholam Ali Oveissi to enable him to flee
    the country in an air force plane; giving permission to the commander of
    the national guard to station tanks at the Dowshan Tappeh base, which were
    used in the killings of February 9; being present at the meeting of army
    commanders with former Premier Shahpour Bakhtiar, where the plan for the
    attack on Dowshan Tappeh was drawn up, though this plan subsequently
    turned against them; being in contact with the CIA through the former US
    ambassador, Richard Helms, implementing American advisors' schemes to
    plunder the country's resources, as established in the confessions of
    Hasratollah Shoayan and (Savak chief) Nasser Moghaddam, and on his own
    confession, causing irreparable loss to the national wealth by employing
    people who had been dismissed for embezzlement and corruption and even
    giving them promotion as established in the confession of Shoayan,
    providing the means of transport to and from South Africa for one of the
    oppressors of that country, according to his own confession, and having
    gone to Israel and had talks on political problems with Israeli leaders.”
    Notes on the Above indictments (p. 77) (i)The indictments often charge
    offences which are capable of an extremely broad interpretation. (ii) The
    method of drafting the indictment may involve reference to Islamic
    concepts such as “corruption on earth” without citation of any other
    specific legal provision such as serves to show a prohibition of the
    alleged act at the time it took place. However, in cases where the act
    complained of is a specific Islamic offence, e.g adultery, no other
    specific citation would be necessary. This is subject to caveat that many
    of the acts alleged to have been committed e.g. Those relating to mere
    participation in the Shah's government, were not unlawful under the
    secular laws in force in Iran at the time they were committed. This caveat
    would not apply to charges of torture and murder, for example, as they
    were always illegal, but the Savak perpetrators of those crimes were not
    prosecuted at the time. Retroactive laws (p. 79) In seeking to purge Iran
    of those concerned with the past regime the courts have imposed dut
