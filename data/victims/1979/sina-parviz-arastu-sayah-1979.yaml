    He was a believing Christian who was murdered eight days after the 1979
    revolution. Information regarding the extrajudicial execution of Mr.
    Parviz (known as Arastoo) Sayah Sina was obtained from an interview by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center with one of the neighbors of Mr. Sayah Sina s
    family (March 7, 2022). Additional information has been obtained from the
    newspapers Kayhan (February 21, 1979, August 11, 1980, August 24, 1980,
    August 26, 1980, August 30, 1980, September 24, 1980, December 10, 1980,
    December 23, 1980, February 9, 1981); Ettela'at (February 21 and 22, 1979,
    May 13, 1980, August 27, 1980); Jomhuri-ye Eslami (August 25, 1980); the
    book The Hard Awakening by Mr. Hassan Dehqani-Tafti* (1980); the websites
    Archives of the Episcopal Church (February 12, 1980); Article 18 (February
    19, 2019); Buffalo News (February 28, 2016); Independent (May 23, 2008);
    the Christian website Kalameh (July 8, 2020); Holy Communion of the
    Diocese of Iran (1971, July 20, 2020); Deutsche Welle (February 18, 2021);
    and Radio Zamaneh (January 17, 2021). According to the available
    information, Mr. Sayah Sina was born into a famous and cultured family in
    Shiraz. After Mr. Sayah Sina finished high school, he went to Esfahan and
    became a textile worker at that city s Vatan factory. At the age of 36,
    after meeting Mr. Hassan Dehqani-Tafti,* the bishop of the Anglican
    Church, he accepted Christianity and studied Christian theology. At the
    age of 38, he went to India and studied theology at a university in
    Punjab, and at the age of 40, he became an assistant to Bishop Hassan
    Dehqani-Tafti. According to his colleagues, Mr. Sayah Sina was a true
    Christian and had a great passion for teaching the Bible. He went to the
    villages to preach his religion and brought a medical team with him to
    help the villagers. He also created jobs for unemployed people (Article
    18). At the age of 45, Mr. Sayah Sina returned to Shiraz and became the
    pastor of St. Simon's Anglican Church. There, he married an English nurse
    who worked at Morsaleen Hospital in Shiraz. The couple had two sons. Mr.
    Sayah Sina had a warm voice and accompanied his sermons with old Persian
    hymns and traditional music, radif avaz. He organized arts and crafts
    workshops for children, and children of all religions could participate in
    them. Mr. Sayah Sina was a well-known, respected and active person in
    Shiraz's Kuche Ad-Din (Alley of Religions), where Jews, Christians, and
    Zoroastrians lived together. The Kuche Ad-Din had a synagogue, a church,
    and a Zoroastrian temple. Before and after the 1979 revolution, Muslims
    who were active in the Islamic Propaganda Association used to come to the
    church to preach Islam, and they mocked and harassed those who went to the
    church (Interview with an acquaintance of Sayah Sina's family). Background
    While Christianity counts among the three Abrahamic religions officially
    recognized in Iran, the status carved out for Christians by the
    Constitution and civil and penal code is markedly inferior. In practice,
    religious tolerance applies only to ethnic groups who are historically
    Christian, i.e. Armenians and Assyrians, and not to believers or converts
    from Muslim backgrounds. The Iranian government has implemented policies
    that demarcate, monitor, and aggressively suppress Christian civic
    presence. The Constitution bars Christians from becoming President,
    members of the Guardian Council, Army Commanders, School Principals, and
    from holding senior government positions. They are prohibited from running
    in General Parliamentary elections, and the three seats allocated to
    Christians in Parliament are exclusively for Armenian, Assyrian, and
    Chaldean representatives. Civil and criminal statutes explicitly
    disadvantage Christian parties. They are entitled to less compensation in
    car-accident settlements and cannot inherit property from Muslims. Several
    offenses punishable by lashings for Muslims are for Christians punishable
    by death. The activities of Christian churches and peoples have long been
    subject to Ministry of Culture surveillance. A law purporting to flag
    sellers of non-halal foods requires Christian shop owners to display signs
    reading designated for religious minorities; in practice, this signage has
    been enforced on all Christian businesses as a deterrent to Muslim
    patrons. Christians have reported denials of academic admissions and
    business permits on religious grounds. By the mid-90s all but two
    Protestant churches had closed under various government pressures,
    including demands to provide congregants names and personal information.
    Since the revolution, hundreds of Christians have been detained
    arbitrarily. Many are sentenced to various prison terms and others are
    released with the specter of charges and investigations against them that
    are left open indefinitely. Multiple sources who have been arrested or
    detained reported being threatened by judicial or security officers with
    apostasy charges, execution, or assassination. With ap
