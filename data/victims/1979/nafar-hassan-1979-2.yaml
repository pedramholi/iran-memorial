    Information regarding Mr. Hassan Nafar s execution was drawn from an
    electronic form (Eform) which a person close to him sent the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation (ABF), his will, and a report by Kayhan Daily on 8
    May 1979. Mr. Nafar was the Head of Hamzeh Team which was a common patrol
    team of SAVAK (the intelligence organization under the Shah). He had 4
    children. According to a person close to him, he was a kind family man.
    Even now, years after his death, everybody remember him as a good soul
    (ABF Eform). Arrest and detention On 26 March 1979, Mr. Nafar was arrested
    by the Revolutionary Committees in Tehran. He had gone to a bank to take
    care of a personal issue. One of the bank clerks recognized him and kept
    him there with delusive excuses until the Revolutionary Committees arrived
    and arrested him. They presented no arrest warrant but Mr. Nafar s name
    was on a blacklist which was given to the banks by the Revolutionary
    Committees. He was detained incommunicado for 34 days. His family was
    unaware of his arrest for several days. They found out through one of
    their relatives who used to work at the prison that he was arrested and
    detained in Qasr Prison (ABF Eform). Trial The Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Tehran tried Mr. Nafar along with 21 others on 7 May 1979 (Kayhan).
    Charges Mr. Nafar s charges are not individually clear. Kayhan Daily
    reported that generally all the 22 people who were tried including Mr.
    Hassan were charged with waging war on god and the 12th Imam, torture,
    cruelty and persecution of people, and participation in mass murders . In
    this report, there is no mention of the victims name or the location of
    the massacres. Evidence of guilt The report on this execution does not
    mention any evidence. Defense There is no information available about Mr.
    Nafar s defense. It is, however, clear from the report of his execution
    that he did not enjoy the minimum standards of due process such as access
    to the legal assistance of an attorney. For example, a person close to Mr.
    Nafar reported that his trial along with 21 others only lasted 30 minutes
    and at the same session, they were told that they were going to be
    executed in order for them to write their wills (ABF Eform). In his will:
    Be aware that I did not kill anyone and I am innocent. I am only the
    victim of jealousy and libel. I leave the judgments to God Mr. Nafar
    denied the murder and persecution charges. He addressed his family in his
    will: Be aware that I did not kill anyone and I am innocent. I am only the
    victim of jealousy and libel. I leave the judgments to God According to a
    person close to him, Mr. Nafar believed that he did not do anything which
    deserved the rage of the revolutionists: We did nothing wrong, we are the
    soldiers of this country; we just did our jobs Mr. Nafar also mentioned: I
    saw forbidden books in the youths hands several times. I only confiscated
    the book and advised them This person close to him narrated a story in
    which Mr. Nafar and his colleagues in the team could defuse a bomb which
    was planted in a stadium and could save thousands of people s lives. Mr.
    Nafar was so sure about his innocence and he could not imagine being
    executed (ABF Eform). Judgment The Revolutionary Court of Tehran declared
    Mr. Nafar along with 21 others guilty of corruption on Earth and condemned
    them to death on 7 May 1979. The verdict was carried out by a firing squad
    on 8 May 1979 at 5 a.m. (ABF Eform). The officials had ordered that their
    bodies could only be buried in Section 41 of Tehran Cemetery, Behesht
    Zahra. They also forced the family to pay 22,000 tomans (which was a high
    amount at the time) for the cost of the bullets that killed Mr. Nafar
    (Kayhan, ABF Eform). Mr. Nafar requested to be buried in Shah Abdol azim s
    Shrine, which is a religiously respected place in Tehran Province, but the
    officials did not allow the family to do so. His funeral was held in the
    presence of the Revolutionary Guards and the members of the Revolutionary
    Committees. According to the person close to him, even now (in 2012),
    after 32 years since Mr. Nafar s execution, the government s agents still
    break all the gravestones in Section 41 of the cemetery once in a while
    (ABF Eform).
