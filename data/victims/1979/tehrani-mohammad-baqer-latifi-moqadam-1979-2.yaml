    The Colonel built barracks and housing for soldiers and planned irrigation
    systems. He was confident about the future, said his daughter, as he d
    done no wrong. The information pertaining to the life and execution of
    Colonel Mohammad Bagher Latifi Moqaddam, an army engineer and a father of
    four, is taken from the memoirs of his daughter, Afshineh Latifi, entitled
    Even After all this Time , Regan Books, New York, 2005, and the May 24,
    1979 issue of the Kayhan Newspaper. Lt. Colonel Mohammad Bagher Latifi
    Moghaddam is also one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty
    International report, Law and Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran
    . The report lists defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary
    Tribunals in the period from their inception until 12 August 1979. The
    list of victims and charges is drawn from sources including translations
    of indictments, reports of trials carried out by local and foreign media
    and the bulletins of the official Pars News Agency reports. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have executed individuals on trumped up
    charges such as drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    According to his daughter, Colonel Latifi had joined the military during
    the reign of Shah at 18. He obtained a masters degree in engineering.
    During his career as a military engineer he was stationed in the cities of
    Maragheh, Mahabad, and Kermanshah. He was in charge of building barracks
    designing bridges, building housing for the soldiers, and planning
    irrigation facilities . The family settled in Tehran, in 1976. In Tehran,
    Colonel Latifi was given the duty to take over as commander of the
    engineering unit of the Guard e Shahanshahi, [the Imperial Guard] . His
    daughter recalls that Colonel Latifi refused to leave the country after
    the revolution. He argued that since he was an engineer and had committed
    no crime he would be safe from persecution. The Islamic Republic's
    officials engaged in, what Colonel Latifi s daughter terms, a
    psychological warfare with his family after his execution. His wife and
    four children were often harassed; their car and house were searched
    repeatedly by the revolutionary guards. Furthermore, after his execution,
    a copy of his Will and Testament was smuggled by a former prison mate and
    presented to his wife. In his Will, he had bequeathed all his belongings
    to his wife and children. Yet, according to his daughter, the authorities
    refused to honor the terms of this Will. Arrest and detention According to
    Colonel Latifi s family s account, on February 13, 1979, a group of
    enlisted men arrested him at his barracks in Farah Abad, Tehran. He was
    stripped of his weapon and escorted to an open jeep by three men. He
    requested that his keys and checkbook be given to his wife. The soldier
    returning these items informed her of his arrest. The soldier gave no
    other information regarding his arrest. The authorities did not inform his
    family of the location of the Colonel s detention. After days of
    searching, his wife located him at a high school that was turned into a
    detention center, Madrese Alavi. He was denied visitation. Colonel Latifi
    held communication with Mrs. Latifi through smuggled notes passed on by
    bribed guards. The communication was interrupted due to his relocation to
    first the Shahrebani Prison and later to the Qasr Prison. He was again
    able to communicate through smuggled notes until he reportedly suffered
    two broken wrists during an interrogation. It is not known exactly how
    long he was deprived of visitation. His family was reportedly often kept
    waiting at the prison gate for hours before being denied admittance. When
    he was finally able to see his family, the visits were carried out in the
    presence of a guard monitoring the conversations. The meetings were held
    in a large room separated in two by a corridor with each half containing a
    low wall and iron bars up to the ceiling. During the one instance that
    Colonel Latifi was permitted to hug his daughter, she was snatched from
    him and dragged through the corridor for having whispered in his ear.
    Colonel Latifi was held at the Qasr Prison for the remainder of his
    detention. Trial Colonel Latifi was tried in May 1979, about three months
    after his arrest, by the Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran. There is no
    mention of a presence of a lawyer for the defendant. In the absence of an
    appeal process, the family of Colonel Latifi attempted an unsuccessful
    direct appeal to Ayatollah Khomeini. Charges Charges against Colonel
    Latifi are taken from his daughter s memoirs, the Amnesty International
    report, and the Kayhan : According to his family and the Kayhan , Colonel
    Latifi was charged with several counts of murder. The charges stemmed from
    a demonstration dating back to the September of 1978 when a number of
    anti-Shah marchers were killed by g
