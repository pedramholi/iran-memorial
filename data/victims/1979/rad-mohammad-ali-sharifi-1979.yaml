    The information regarding Mr. Mohammad Ali Sharifi Rad’s execution along
    with one other was drawn from an Electronic form (E-form) which his son
    sent to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) and a news report by
    Kayhan Daily on 14 April 1979. Mr. Sharifi Rad’s titles included Major
    Head of Police Guards of Khoramabad—located in Lorestan Province in the
    west of Iran—and Head of the Central Police Station. He was married with
    three children and a graduate from the Police University. His son
    described his father: “He was a true nationalist. Although the triumph of
    the Islamic Revolution was definitive, he did not desert his post and
    preferred his country and his duties over everything thing he had in
    life.” (ABF E-form) Arrest and detention Mr. Sharifi Rad was arrested on
    11 February 1979 in Khoramabad (ABF E-form). Trial The Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Khoramabad tried Mr. Sharifi Rad on 13 April 1979 (Kayhan).
    Charges Kayhan Daily reported Mr. Sharifi Rad’s charges as: “4 counts of
    murder; harassment, persecution, torture, and repression of people.”
    Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence
    presented against Mr. Sharifi Rad. Defense No information is available
    concerning Sharifi Rad’s defense, and it is not clear if he had the
    ability and opportunity to defend himself or if he had access to the
    minimum standards of due process of law such as the legal assistance of an
    attorney. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Judgment The Revolutionary Tribunal of Khoramabad declared
    Mr. Sharifi guilty and sentenced him to death. According to Kayhan’s
    report, Mr. Sharifi Rad and one other requested before the execution that
    “people should not get close to their bodies and that the verdict should
    be carried out in a way that they will not suffer” (Kayhan). The reasons
    for these requests are not clear. Moreover, it is not known if the
    defendants had seen an assault on the executees’ cadavers. Mr. Sharifi Rad
    was presented before a firing squad on 14 April 1979 at 6:00 a.m. along
    with one other. He was executed on his 36th birthday (Kayhan, ABF E-form).
