    The information regarding Lieutenant Hafez Sarnevesht along with one other
    was drawn from Kayhan Daily on 4 June 1979. Lieutenant Sarnevesht was the
    Head of Rafsanjan Criminal Police, a city in Kerman Province in
    southeastern Iran. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Lieutenant
    Sarnevesht’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Rafsanjan tried Lieutenant Sarnevesht along with 13 others.
    According to Kayhan, this trial was held “in the presence of hundreds of
    audiences and reporters of mass media, radio and television” and lasted
    for two sessions. Charges Kayhan Daily reported Lieutenant Sarnevesht’s
    charges as “the murder of martyr-warrior Hossein Ansari, blasphemy of the
    Quran, and opposition to the Deputy of the Twelfth Imam” (Note: Ayatollah
    Khomeini, who was the establisher of the Islamic Republic, considered
    himself as the representative of the Twelfth Imam during his absence.)
    Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence
    presented against Lieutenant Sarnevesht. Defense No information is
    available concerning Lieutenant Sarnevesht’s defense and it is not clear
    if he had the opportunity to defend himself effectively, for example
    whether he had access to a lawyer or the possibility to summon witnesses
    in his favor, etc. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Judgment The Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Rafsanjan sentenced Lieutenant Sarnevesht along with one other to death.
    The verdict was carried out at 5:00 a.m. on 4 June 1979.
