circumstances: >
    The execution of Seyyed Mahmud Shamsnia was reported by the Kayhan and
    Enqelab Eslami correspondents in Esfahan (October 4, 1979). Based on the
    Enqelab Eslami report, this individual was the first cleric sentenced to
    death after the Revolution in Iran. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Shamsnia’s trial. Charges
    According to the report, Mr. Shamsnia was charged with “collaboration with
    SAVAK, espionage, illegitimate use of the sacred religious attire,
    praising the corrupt monarchy, deceiving uninformed people, misleading
    innocent girls, offending public decency and homosexual acts under the
    cover of religion and religious attire.” Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain any information regarding the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information about Mr.
    Shamsnia’s defense is available. Judgment The Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Esfahan declared Seyyed Mahmud Shamsnia guilty of “corruption on earth”
    and “waging war against God and his prophet.” He was sentenced to death.
