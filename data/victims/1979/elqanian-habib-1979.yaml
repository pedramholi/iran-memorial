    Iran s first plastic factory was among his early enterprises. He was
    proud, he told a tribunal, to be an Iranian Jew. The execution of Mr.
    Habib Elqanian, along with 5 other individuals, was reported in the Kayhan
    newspaper on May 9, 1979. Mr. Elqanian is also one of the 438 victims
    listed in an Amnesty International report dated March 13, 1980. The report
    lists defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the
    period from their inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and
    charges is drawn from sources including translations of indictments,
    reports of trials carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins
    of the official Pars News Agency reports. Further information has been
    drawn from an interview with a an individual familiar with this case, the
    indictment, Mr. Elqanian s will (May 8, 1979), the memoranda of the
    Central Prosecutor s Office to the Expropriation Foundation ( Bonyad-e
    Mostaz afin , May 16, 1979; July 14, 1980), The Jerusalem Post (May 10,
    1979) and an electronic form sent to Omid by a person familiar with this
    case. Mr. Elqanian, having finished his higher education in France,
    returned to Iran to start his own import-export business. He founded the
    first plastic company in Iran, Plasco, and owned aluminum and refrigerator
    factories as well (Jerusalem Post). Before the 1979 Revolution, Mr.
    Elqanian was arrested and released (interview). Arrest and detention The
    exact circumstances of Mr. Elhaqian arrest and detention are not known.
    Mr. Elqanian was arrested on February 16, 1979 ( Kayhan ), soon after he
    returned to Iran after a trip to the United States of America to visit his
    family there (Jerusalem Post). Trial Based on the Kayhan report, Mr.
    Elqanian was tried at Branch 3 of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal on
    May 8, 1979. The trial session started in the afternoon and ended at 10:30
    p.m. The trial reportedly lasted for 7 to 10 minutes (interview). Charges
    The following charges were brought against Mr. Elqanian in the indictment:
    1. Friendship with the enemies of God; hostility towards the friends of
    God 2. Espionage for Israel, the Zionist usurper 3. Collecting funds for
    the support and aid of Israel and its usurper army, which bombs the
    defenseless Muslim people of Palestine everyday 4. Spending funds and
    benefits, which have been derived from the exploitation of Iranians to
    construct belligerent usurper Israel, which is against Islam and God 5.
    Corruption on earth in the form of destroying society s human resources 6.
    Fighting against God, his Prophet, the Representative of the Twelfth Imam,
    and against our disinherited people 7. Obstructing the way of God and the
    way towards happiness for all the disinherited people in the world;
    Obstructing Islamic and human values 8. Corruption on earth 9.
    Contributing to the cruel daily massacre of [the] valiant people of
    Palestine. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Amnesty International notes that the case against Mr.
    Elqanian is the only instance known to Amnesty International of a
    non-Muslim being charged with a Qur an offence. Part Three of the
    indictment against him reads: Taking into consideration [the text of parts
    one and two of the indictment] and applying specified and unspecified
    verses of the Holy Qur an... and other words transmitted by the Tradition
    of the saints it is requested that the defendant be sentenced to death and
    that his property and that of his family be confiscated . Evidence of
    guilt The indictment lists the following proofs of guilt: 1. Confessions,
    some of a specific character and others circumstantial, as set out in the
    case file 2. Evidence, including documents and other proof of actions
    undertaken by the defendant, showing that he sent money to Israel to
    strengthen its defense capability 3. Organizing a meeting with leaders of
    the Zionist state such as Moshe Dayan and Abba Eban and other usurpers,
    all of whom are the cruelest enemies of God and the Palestinian people 4.
    The purchase of property and high-rise buildings. Following Mr. Elqanian s
    defense (see below), the Prosecutor s representative defended the
    indictment, which, he stressed, was based on reports by unnamed SAVAK
    agents (known as Tuesday and Wednesday) and on the statements of the
    accused during the interrogation. The reports concerned the purchase of a
    piece of land near Tel Aviv in 1970 and a meeting with Moshe Dayan and
    Abba Eban in 1973, during which Mr. Elqanian allegedly committed to
    encouraging more Iranian financial aid and Jewish immigration to Israel.
    During the court session, he stated: I ask you if you opposed the Zionism,
    in what way did you express your opposition in order to inform your fellow
    Jews? We rely on the report of SAVAK, the most important security entity
    that collaborated with the CIA. One SAVAK report states that you have paid
    a million dollars for a piece of land in Tel Aviv, the
