    Dr. Mohammad Baghai-Yazdi was a former member of Parliament and Rastakhiz
    party and a SAVAK physician. He is one of 438 victims listed in a March
    13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who
    were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their
    inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn
    from sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials
    carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official
    Pars News Agency reports. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have executed individuals on trumped up charges such as drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and
    detention No information regarding the defendant's arrest and detention is
    available. Trial Amnesty International's report on this execution contains
    no information regarding the defendant's identity or trial. Charges The
    charges against Dr. Baghai-Yazdi, according to the Amnesty report, were:
    torture (physical); suppressing demonstrators, suppressing national and
    religious demonstrations, punishing demonstrators; bringing pressure to
    divide the people, crimes against the people and the revolution,
    activities against the people during the revolution, crushing those
    seeking their rights, threatening villagers, conspiring to break the
    people's will, creating insecurity, creating terror among the public. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available on the evidence presented
    against Dr. Baghai-Yazdi. Defense No information is available on the
    defence. Judgment The defendant was sentenced to death and executed. No
    further information is available.
