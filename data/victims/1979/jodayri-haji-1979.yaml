    Information regarding Mr. Haji Jodayri s (Also known Singali) execution
    was drawn from Kayhan Daily (28 and 29 August 1979), Khalq Mosalman (6
    September 1979), and Jomhuri Eslami (28 and 20 August 1979). On 27 August
    1979, there was a riot among common prisoners in Ward 6 and the Temporary
    Ward of Tabriz Prison. According to the existing information, days before
    the incident the atmosphere in the prison had been hostile due to
    prisoners protesting to their prolonged uncertain situation. They chanted
    slogans against some of the judicial and prison officials (Khalq Mosalman,
    6 September 1979). In the morning of 27 August, the Warden went into the
    ward to negotiate with the inmates. He was almost successful to convince
    the prisoners, but it is not clear why the prisoners changed their minds.
    They beat the Warden and the prison guards and set Ward 6 on fire. They
    also took some hostages. Although in the last hours of the riots, they
    released the hostages themselves. The riot finished after 10 to 15 hours
    after the interference of the army, the revolutionary guards and the
    revolutionary committees (Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami, 29 August 1979).
    There are contradictory details about this riot from governmental and
    independent resources. On 29 August, Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami stated that
    the officials only used non-lethal forces such as batons, tear gas and
    warning shots. Whereas according to the report of Kayhan itself on 28
    August, at one occasion, the Revolutionary Guards opened fire at a group
    of prisoners who were allegedly escaping. These shootings left 13 inmates
    injured and 1 dead and also killed a member of the Revolutionary
    Committees (Kayhan, 28 August 1979). The driver of an ambulance which came
    into the prison yard to take out a body was locked in, and because the
    door was locked from outside, he was injured with a knife (Kayhan and
    Jomhuri Eslami, 29 August 1979). Arrest and detention No information
    regarding Mr. Jodayri's arrest and detention is available. He was
    apparently spending his pre-trial detention in Tabriz Prison. Trial Mr.
    Jodayri was tried along with 13 others in Tabriz Revolutionary Tribunal.
    According to the statement of Tabriz Revolutionary Tribunal, the trial of
    these 14 defendants began in the morning of 29 August, and the verdicts
    were carried out before noon of the same day (Jomhuri Eslami, 29 August
    1979). Charges Mr. Jodayri s charges are not individually defined, but the
    statement of the Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz indicated that all the
    14 defendants were responsible for inciting riots and unrest, arson and
    destruction of the prison, stabbing the revolutionary guards and
    participation in the murder of one revolutionary guard and one inmate
    (Jomhuri Eslami, 29 August 1979). The statement by the Revolutionary Court
    provided that the prisoners, who were involved in the riots, were
    responsible for serious crimes. For example, it claimed that Mr. Jodayri
    was in prison for armed robbery, rape, sodomy, possession of heroin and
    the last time again for sodomy (Jomhuri Eslami, 29 August 1979).
    Accordingly, Kayhan claimed that these prisoners were probably going to be
    sentenced to execution or long-term prison; therefore, they made a riot to
    escape (Kayhan, 29 August 1979(. Evidence of guilt There is no information
    about the evidence against the Mr. Jodayri. Kayhan indicated that the
    Religious Judge of Tabriz Revolutionary Tribunal was watching the riot
    from the roof of one of the buildings and was identifying the prisoners
    involved in it. So in the trial, he denied the prisoner s defenses by
    giving them examples of their behavior in the riot (Kayhan, 29 August
    1979). Defense There is no information available about Mr. Jodayri s
    defense, and it is not clear if he managed to find a lawyer or prepare his
    defense in the limited time between the end of the riots and the trial.
    The statement of the Revolutionary Tribunal mentioned the conspiracy of
    the anti-revolutionists, whereas the newspapers close to the government
    reported that the riots were carried out by the common prisoners in order
    to protest to the violation of their rights to due process and that the
    political prisoners had no role in it. Only two of the defendants had a
    case in the Revolutionary Tribunal (Kayhan, 29 August 1979). All the
    parties even the newspapers close to the government- agreed that the
    reason of this riot was the prisoners long wait for trial and undue
    influence in their cases. The Warden of Tabriz Prison at the time said:
    there are prisoners who were arrested 6 months ago but their cases are
    still pending . The prisoners requested Ayatollah Taleqani, a member of
    Khebregan of the Constitution (a transitional institution which was formed
    to draft the first Iranian constitution after the Islamic Revolution), to
    come to Tabriz. They also wanted the prison conditions to be reconsidered
    (Kayhan, Jomhuri Eslami, 28 and 29 August and Khalq Mosalman, 6 September
    1979). In addition, the claims of the newspapers clos
