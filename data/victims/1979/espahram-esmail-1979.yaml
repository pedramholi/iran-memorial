    The execution of Major General Esmail Espahram was reported in the Kayhan
    and Enqelab Eslami dailies (October 15, 1979). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Maj. Gen. Espahram’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial According to the Enqelab Eslami report, the defendant’s trial at the
    First Branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center lasted
    two and a half hours. Charges Based on the Enqelab Eslami report, Maj.
    Gen. Espahram was charged with “mobilizing stick-wielding hooligans,
    suppressing the revolutionary combatants and handing them over to the
    SAVAK [Shah's political police], and participation in the murder of the
    revolutionaries, particularly 2 of the combatants of Zahedan." Other
    charges against the defendant were “bribery, blackmailing the region’s
    drug dealers, and illegal withdrawal from the Public Treasury [Beit
    al-Mal].” The number or identity of the mentioned revolutionaries and
    combatants was not clear in the report. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against the
    accused. Defense The Enqelab Eslami daily correspondent mentioned that no
    substantial defense was presented by the defendant at his trial in Tehran.
    Judgment Based on the reports, Maj. Gen. Esparham, who had already been
    tried and convicted by the religious judge in Sistan and Baluchestan, was
    retried in Tehran at his own request. After reconfirmation, the death
    sentence was carried out at dawn shortly after its issuance.
