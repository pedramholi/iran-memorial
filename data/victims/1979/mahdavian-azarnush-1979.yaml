    The information about Mr. Azarnush Mahdavian, son of Abdolqoddus, was sent
    to Omid by a relative through an electronic form. His execution along with
    10 other men was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on August 19, 1979.
    Additional information about this case has been gathered by the Boroumand
    Foundation from the book Sahifeh-ye Emam by Ayatollah Khomeini, volume 9,
    the book Ayam-e Enzava (Times of Solitude) by Ayatollah Khalkhali, the
    Kayhan newspaper (Aug. 23, and Sep. 25, 1979), the report The Demise of
    Sadeq Khalkhali by Mansur Boluri (Iranian Political Bulletin, Nov. 30,
    2003), as well as the report Murder at Mykonos published by the Iran Human
    Rights Documentation Center. According to the Kayhan , he was member of
    the Tudeh Party of Iran. Mr. Mahdavian was born in Tabriz on October 16,
    1947. He worked at the State Welfare Organization (Sazman Behzisti). Mr.
    Mahdavian s execution was part of a wave of executions that took place in
    order to combat the anti-Revolutionary elements in the Kordestan region.
    Following the negotiations between the Kordish Democratic Party of Iran
    (PDKI) and the interim prime minister, several clashes occurred, at times
    armed, between the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of
    the PDKI) particularly in the cities of Sanandaj (Kordestan province) and
    Paveh (Kermanshah province). These intensifying conflicts between the new
    central Shiite government of Iran and the mainly Sunni region of Kordestan
    concerned the role of minorities in the drafting of the constitution,
    specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and particularly
    the autonomy of the region. Subsequent to conflicts that resulted in some
    casualties, on August 18, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini issued an order to the
    military and the armed forces to move to Paveh and end the fighting In the
    same order, he encouraged them to use force and threatened that: if they
    do not move toward Paveh within 24 hours with missiles and tanks and all
    necessary arsenals, I will hold them accountable. And in case of any
    infringement of this order, I will treat them in a Revolutionary manner.
    On August 19, Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan and
    declared it unofficial and illegal noting that some of these anti-Islamic
    individuals had boycotted the referendum of April 1, when people went to
    polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime. In accordance with
    Khomeini s order, Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali traveled the western region of
    Iran and told a reporter from the Ettela at newspaper: I will visit all
    areas of Kordestan and will bring to justice anybody who was involved in
    these bloody plots. According to Mr. Boluri, Ayatollah Khalkhali condemned
    at least 58 Kords to death in the span of 10 days. Mass executions and
    conflicts continued for many months in that region. The Tudeh Party of
    Iran was created in 1941. The Tudeh s ideology was Marxist Leninist and it
    supported the former Soviet Union s policies. The Party played a major
    role on Iran s political scene until it was banned for a second time
    following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh
    declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of its attacks from 1982 when most of the Party s
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    Revolutionary Guards arrested Mr. Mahdavian in his house at 2 p.m. on
    August 18, 1979, without showing him an arrest warrant. They took him to
    Dizel Abad prison in Kermanshah. Based on the available information, he
    was interrogated for 4 hours. From the time of arrest until his execution,
    he was in detention for about 12 hours. He did not have visit with his
    family members. According to statements of the religious judge in
    Kermanshah Province, it appears that authorities prohibited the families
    from visiting the prisoners: I request the families to look after their
    children and watch for any anti-Revolutionary behavior or activity. [I
    also ask them] not to follow up with the cases of their children and let
    the Revolutionary Tribunals carry out their functions ( Kayhan , Aug. 23,
    1979). Trial The report of the execution does not refer to a trial and
    only mentions the interrogation of defendants and testimony of witnesses.
    In an interview dated August 23, the religious judge of Kermanshah denied
    the rumors of execution of leftists without trial. In another interview
    about the recent executions in the region he stated: the proceedings were
    carried with outmost attention and careful investigation. The court has
    never acted outside the Islamic criteria since the court is not only
    responsible before the people, but it is also accountable before God It is
    true that the trial had particularities of wartime, but the crimes were
    certainly proven based on explicit confession of defendants, testimony of
    witnesses, and other e
