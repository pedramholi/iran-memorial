circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Asadollah Faramarzi was reported by the correspondent
    of the Kayhan daily in Aligudarz and the correspondent of Pars News Agency
    in Qom (October 4, 1979). The Enqelab Eslami daily of October 4 published
    the Pars News Agency report. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Kayhan report specified that Mr. Faramarzi’s trial at the
    Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecution Office of Aligudarz was public
    and lasted 10 hours. Charges Mr. Faramarzi, referred to in the Kayhan
    report as “one of the prominent landowners of the Deh Haji and Kahriz
    region,” was charged with “violating people’s sexual honor”, “assault
    resulting in death”, and “creating terror among people.” Evidence of guilt
    The Kayhan report of this execution referred only to the “witnesses’
    testimonies” as the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense The
    Kayhan report mentioned that Mr. Faramarzi’s defense was heard, but the
    nature and circumstances of the defense remain unknown. Judgment Mr.
    Faramarzi was sentenced to death. The sentence was carried out at 1 a.m.,
    based on the Kayhan repor, or at 2:30 a.m., based on the Pars report.
