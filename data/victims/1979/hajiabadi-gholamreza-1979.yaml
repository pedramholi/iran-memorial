circumstances: >
    The information about the execution of Mr. Gholamreza Hajiabadi was
    published by the newspaper Enqelab-e Eslami , September 1, 1979.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against these defendants
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The charges brought against the defendant were
    "rape, adultery, participating in looting and setting the city of
    Najafabad on fire." Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hajiabadi's defense.
    Judgment The defendant was sentenced to death by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Najafabad for being a "corruptor on earth and at war with
    God." He was executed at dawn on Thursday, August 30, 2004, in the city of
    Esfahan.
