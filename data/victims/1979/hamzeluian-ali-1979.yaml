    Captain Ali Hamzehluian, the former intelligence chief of police in
    Shahsevar, is one of 438 victims listed in an Amnesty International
    report, dated March 13, 1980. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August, 1979. The main source of the Amnesty International report
    is the news coverage by Iranian and foreign media and the bulletins of the
    official Pars News Agency. Additional information was sent to the
    Boroumand Foundation via two electronic forms by persons familiar with the
    case. According to this information, Captain Hamzeh Luian, son of Mojtaba,
    was born in Arak in 1947. He was married and had a daughter. His education
    has been listed as a bachelor's degree. Based on one of the electronic
    forms, Captain Hamzeh Luian was an officer in the army, but according to
    the other electronic form, he was an officer for Savak - the previous
    regime’s intelligence agency. Arrest and detention According to one of the
    electronic forms, Captain Hamzehluian was arrested in the city of
    Tonekabon, in the Mazandaran Province. However, according to the other
    electronic form, he was arrested in Tehran. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. According to one of the electronic
    forms, his witnesses and relatives were not allowed to be present at his
    trial. Charges The charges against Captain Hamzehluian, according to the
    Amnesty International report, were “mass murder” and “murder of the Muslim
    people.” According to the information provided through the electronic
    forms, he was found to a “corruptor on earth.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available on the evidence presented against the defendant.
    Defense According to an electronic form, Captain Hamzehluian was denied an
    attorney and had to act as his own attorney at the trial. Judgment
    According to the information provided through the electronic forms,
    Captain Hamzehluian was condemned to death. He was executed by a firing
    squad on June 1, 1979. His family learned about his execution from the
    news on the radio.
