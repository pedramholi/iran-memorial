circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Karim Rahrovi and three others was reported in the
    Kayhan daily (September 4, 1979). The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Ni information about the trial is available. Charges The defendant
    was accused of "being a SAVAK [Shah's political police] informant and
    having illicit sexual relationships with his step daughter." Evidence of
    guilt The report referred to the witnesses' statements but provided no
    further information in this regard. Defense No information is available on
    the defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Mahabad
    sentenced Mr. Rahrovi to death. He was executed at dawn.
