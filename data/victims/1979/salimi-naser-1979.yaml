    Information about the execution of Mr. Naser Salimi has been gathered by
    the Boroumand Foundation from the report “The Demise of Sadeq Khalkhali”
    by Mansur Boluri (Iranian Political Bulletin, 30 November 2003), and the
    book Ayam-e Enzava (Times of Solitude) by Ayatollah Khalkhali. Additional
    information has been drawn from the book Sahifeh-ye Emam by Ayatollah
    Khomeini, volume 9, the report Murder at Mykonos published by the Iran
    Human Rights Documentation Center, the list of victims of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization, as well as the article “A Chilling Photograph’s Hidden
    History” by Joshua Prager, published in The Wall Street Journal on
    December 02, 2006. This article tells the story of the photograph of this
    execution by Mr. Jahangir Razmi. According to this article, Mr. Salimi was
    an employee of the Department of Health in Sanandaj (Kordestan province).
    According to the available information, he was a sympathizer of the
    Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. Mr. Salimi’s execution was part of a wave of
    executions that took place in order to combat the “anti-Revolutionary”
    elements in Kurdistan. Following the negotiations between the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) and the interim prime minister, several
    clashes occurred, at times armed, between the Revolutionary Guards and the
    peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI) particularly in the cities of Sanandaj
    and Paveh (Kermanshah province). These intensifying conflicts between the
    new central Shiite government of Iran and the mainly Sunni Kurdistan
    region concerned the role of minorities in the drafting of the
    constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and
    particularly the autonomy of the region. Subsequent to conflicts that
    resulted in some casualties, on August 18, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini issued
    an order to the military and the armed forces to “move to Paveh and end
    the fighting…” In the same order, he encouraged them to use force and
    threatened that: “if they do not move toward Paveh within 24 hours with
    missiles and tanks and all necessary arsenals, I will hold them
    accountable. And in case of any infringement of this order, I will treat
    them in a Revolutionary manner” ( Sahifeh-ye Emam , p. 285). On August 19,
    Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the “party of Satan” and declared it
    “unofficial and illegal” noting that some of these “anti-Islamic”
    individuals had boycotted the referendum of April 1, when people went to
    polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime ( ibid p. 311). In
    accordance with Khomeini’s order, Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali traveled the
    western region of Iran and told a reporter from the Ettela’at newspaper:
    “I will visit all areas of Kurdistan… and will bring to justice anybody
    who was involved in these bloody plots” ( Times of Solitude p. 96).
    According to Mr. Boluri, Ayatollah Khalkhali condemned at least 58 Kurds
    to death in the span of 10 days. Mass executions and conflicts continued
    for many months in that region. The photograph of this execution was
    published in the Ettela’at (August 28, 1979). However, the newspaper did
    not reportedly publish the picture in the version sent to Kordestan
    province (Mr. Prager’s article). This photograph was also sent to and
    published by international press, such as The News York Times , The
    Washington Post , and The Daily Telegraph of London. The same day as the
    publication of Ettela’at , the religious judge claimed that it was not an
    authentic picture. On September 9, the Islamic Revolutionary Council, in a
    communiqué published in Enqelab-e Eslami newspaper, referred to this
    picture and stated: “If this occurs again, serious decisions will be
    made.” The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired
    by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America,
    was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed
    struggle, split over the support to the Islamic Republic and to the Soviet
    Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was
    mainly active in the political arena and the labor movement. The Fadaiyan
    Khalq Majority considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary and
    anti-imperialist regime and supported it. It shared the views of the Tudeh
    Party and collaborated with the government. By 1983, however, its
    political beliefs made its supporters the target of the Islamic Republic’s
    repression. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Salimi’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial According to Mr. Prager, “10 handcuffed
    men filled a wooden bench before the judge, a black-bearded Shiite cleric
    named Sadegh Khalkhali. An injured 11th prisoner lay on a stretcher beside
    the door. The judge removed his turban… removed his shoes. He put his feet
    on a chair. Scanning the prisoners through thick eyeglasses, he asked
    their names. Officers of the court told of the defendants’ alleged
    crimes.” The trial lasted for about
