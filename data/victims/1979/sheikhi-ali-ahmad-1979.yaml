    The execution of Mr. Ali Ahmad Sheikhi and another individual from Harsin
    (Kermanshah province) was reported by the correspondents of the Kayhan
    (October 8, 1979) and Enqelab Eslami (October 10, 1979) dailies in
    Kermanshah. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial. Charges Based on the report, Mr. Sheikhi was
    charged with "murder and plunder, armed robbery, assault and battery of
    the revolutionaries, harassing Muslims in order to support the hated
    regime, carrying drugs, attacking the Revolutionary Guards, and
    blackmailing the oppressed people." The validity of the criminal charges

    the Enqelab Eslami report, the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Kermanshah declared Mr. Sheikhi a "corruptor on earth" and an "enemy of
    God" and sentenced him to death. The sentence was carried out at 11 p.m.
    He was also ordered to hand over to the court the 120,000 Rials that he
    had allegedly taken forcefully from the people of Parireh Village.
