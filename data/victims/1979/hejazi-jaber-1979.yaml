circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Jaber Hejazi and another individual was reported by
    the correspondents of the Enqelab Eslami (September 19, 1979) and the
    Kayhan (September 20, 1979) newspapers. Arrest and detention Based on the
    Enqelab Eslami report, the defendant was arrested by the officials of the
    Shiraz Air Force Security Headquarters in Zand Street in Shiraz. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The Enqelab
    Eslami report mentioned the defendant’s charge as “carrying 350 grams of
    heroin” whereas the Kayhan report referred to “buying and selling 145
    grams of heroin and having a long criminal history in this regard.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Shiraz declared Mr. Hejazi a “corruptor on earth” and sentenced him to
    death. He was executed at dawn on 20 September 1979 in Shiraz.
