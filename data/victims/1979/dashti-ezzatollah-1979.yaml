    The information regarding Mr. Ezzatollah Dashti s case is collected from
    Kayhan Daily (10 and 11 April, 1979) and an Eform which a person close to
    him sent Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) on 6 December 2010. Mr.
    Dashti was born in Anuj village in Malayer, a city in Hamedan Province in
    western Iran. He was a lieutenant in the police force in Borujerd in
    Lorestan Province in the west of Iran. He was not affiliated with any
    political parties or groups. He had 4 children, 2 daughters and 2 sons
    (ABF Eform). Arrest and detention Mr. Dashti turned himself in to the
    Revolutionary Committees in Tehran in March 1979 according to a person
    close to him (ABF Eform). Trial The Revolutionary Tribunal of Borujerd
    tried Mr. Dashti with two others. According to Kayhan, this was an open
    trial in which 200 people attended. It lasted for 12 hours (Kayhan, 11
    April, 1979). The court was held in the building of the Borujerd
    Municipality (ABF Eform). Charges According to a person close to Mr.
    Dashti, he was charged with shooting warning shots, waging war on god,
    beating protesters, kissing the hand of the former queen, Farah, and being
    loyal to Shah and the country (ABd Eform). Kayhan did not report the
    details of Mr. Dashti s charges individually, but it generally reported
    that Mr. Dashti along with another defendants were charged with murder,
    beating, torture, and trespassing on private property (Kayhan, 11 April
    1979). Evidence of guilt Kayhan referred to some testimonies against Mr.
    Dashti. According to the information which was sent to ABF, the witnesses
    were not neutral and they were paid to testify against the defendant.
    Other than these testimonies, there was no other evidence against Mr.
    Dashti (ABF Eform). Defense There is no information about Mr. Dashti s
    defense. According to the information which was sent to ABF, he was
    deprived of his rights to access a lawyer or prepare his defense, etc. He
    was also denied the right to appeal the verdict (ABF Eform). The word
    which Kayhan used for his trial was interrogation which per se can create
    doubts about the court s neutrality (Kayhan, 11 April 1358). Judgment The
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Borujerd declared Mr. Dashti guilty and
    sentenced him to death. This verdict was carried out at 5:20 a.m. on 10
    April 1979 in the Central Prison of Borujerd by a fire squad. The next
    day, Kayhan published a picture of Mr. Dashti, tied up to an execution
    pole and blindfolded.
