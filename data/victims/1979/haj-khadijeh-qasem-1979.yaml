circumstances: >
    The news of the execution of Ms. Khadijeh Qasem Haj was reported by the
    Kayhan and Enqelab Eslami correspondents in Babol (October 10, 1979). The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention Based on this reports, Ms. Qasem Haj, mother
    of four, was arrested “following complaints by her husband, brother, and
    people in her neighborhood.” Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges Based on the reports, Ms. Qasem Haj was charged
    with adultery and “acts incompatible with chastity” (“corrupting women and
    girls”). Evidence of guilt The reports of this execution do not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Qasem Haj's defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Babol sentenced Ms. Qasem Haj to death.
    However, the carrying out of the sentence was delayed since she was
    believed to be pregnant. After the accused was examined by a doctor who
    concluded that she was not pregnant, Ms. Qasem Haj was put before the
    firing squad in the palace of the former Shah in Babol and was shot to
    death.
