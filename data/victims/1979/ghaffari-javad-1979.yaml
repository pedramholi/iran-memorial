    Mr. Javad Ghaffari was a retired parachute captain, chief of SAVAK's
    Kayhan group, and chief of anti-sabotage unit in Tehran. He is one of 438
    victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The
    report lists defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in
    the period from their inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims
    and charges is drawn from sources including translations of indictments,
    reports of trials carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins
    of the official Pars News Agency reports. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic’s authorities have executed individuals on trumped up charges
    such as drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact
    number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest
    and detention No information regarding the defendant's arrest and
    detention is available. Trial Amnesty International's report on this
    execution contains no information regarding the defendant's identity or
    trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Ghaffari, according to the Amnesty
    report, were: corruption on earth; war on God, war on God's prophet and
    the deputy Imam Zaman, war against the representative of the Twelfth Imam;
    mass murder, massacre of innocent people; torture (physical); agents of
    anti-Islamic government; bringing pressure to divide the people, crimes
    against the people and the revolution, activities against the people
    during the revolution, crushing those seeking their rights, threatening
    villagers, conspiring to break the people's will, creating insecurity,
    creating terror among the public. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available on the evidence presented against Mr. Ghaffari. Defense No
    information is available on the defence. Judgment The defendant was
    sentenced to death and executed. No further information is available.
