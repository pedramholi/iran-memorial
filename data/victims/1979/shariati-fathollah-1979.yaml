    Mr. Fathollah Shariati (mistakenly named Abdollah) is one of 438 victims
    listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists
    defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period
    from their inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges
    is drawn from sources including translations of indictments, reports of
    trials carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the
    official Pars News Agency reports. His execution was announced in the
    Kayhan newspaper on June 27, 1979. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of Mr. Shari’ati’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial There is no
    information regarding this trial. Charges Kayhan reported that Mr.
    Shari’ati was charged with “participation in looting houses and causing
    arson in Najaf Abad [Esfahan province]... several counts of acts
    incompatible with chastity, and murder of his own child.” The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have executed individuals on trumped up
    charges such as drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The newspaper states that the “criminal file is
    available”, but did not provide any information about such a file. Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Shari’ati’s defense. Judgment
    The religious tribunal condemned Mr. Shari’ati to death. He was executed
    by firing squad of the Revolutionary Guards Corps at 2 a.m. on June 27,
    1979 in Najaf Abad.
