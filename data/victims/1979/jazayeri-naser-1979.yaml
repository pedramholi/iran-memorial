    The information about Mr. Naser Jazayeri, son of Seyed-Nezamodin, is based
    on two electronic forms sent to Omid by persons familiar with his case and
    an interview with his brother. News of his prosecution and conviction was
    published in Kayhan newspaper on April 23, and June 10, 1979. Mr. Naser
    Jazayeri is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty
    International report. The report lists defendants who were convicted by
    Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception until 12 August
    1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from sources including
    translations of indictments, reports of trials carried out by local and
    foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News Agency reports.
    According to the existing information, Mr. Naser Jazayeri was born in
    Khoramabad in 1950. He was married with two children. He graduated from
    the military collage and was a first lieutenant. Before the revolution, he
    was the chief of Police Station 2 in Khoramabad. He was in charge of
    keeping order in town when street demonstrations took place during the
    last few months of the Shah s regime. After the victory of the revolution
    in February of 1979, he was transferred to a police station in Noshahr.
    His relatives remember Mr. Jazayeri as a kind and family oriented man. His
    family was well known in Khoramabad and his grandfather, Seyed-Abutorab
    Jazayeri, was a high-ranking clergy. Arrest and detention According to the
    information sent to Omid, Mr. Naser Jazayeri was arrested in front of his
    work place at Noshahr police station in April of 1979. He was transferred
    to the Khoramabad prison. Apparently, the reason for his arrest was a
    complaint by a family who claimed that Mr. Jazayeri had killed their son
    during a demonstration. He was detained at Khoramabad and Evin prisons. He
    had some visitation with his family. Trial According to the Kayhan
    newspaper published on April 23, 1979, the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Khoramabad convened to prosecute Mr. Naser Jazayeri. After his defense,
    the trial was postponed in order to summon a police officer witness who
    was transferred to Ahvaz. On June 10, 1979, the Kayhan newspaper reported
    that on June 9, 1979, the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Khoramabad tried
    and condemned First Lieutenant Naser Jazayeri to death for murdering and
    injuring innocent people. According to his brother, the trial of Mr.
    Jazayeri took place in presence of the victim s family in Khoramabad in
    May or June of 1979 and condemned him to death. This ruling was confirmed
    and carried out in Tehran. Charges According to the Kayhan newspaper and
    the information sent to Omid, the charges against Mr. Naser Jazayeri were
    Murder and Assault and battery. According to the Amnesty International
    report, the charges against Mr. Jazayeri were suppressing demonstrations,
    murdering revolutionaries, and participation in shooting at them. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt According to the interviewee, the evidence provided
    against Mr. Naser Jazayeri was testimonies of two individuals claiming
    that he had shot a twenty-one-years-old man. Defense No detailed
    information is available about Mr. Naser Jazayeri s defense. The Kayhan
    newspaper report only refers to the defendant s defense against the
    indictment. According to one electronic form, Mr. Jazayeri was sacrificed
    in a feud between tribes in Khoramabad and did not participate in the
    shooting. According to his brother, Mr. Jazayeri insisted in his innocence
    and told his mother during a visitation that he did not even once shot at
    people. He only fired some shots in the air to disperse the demonstrators.
    Quoting some relatives, his brother adds that Mr. Jazayeri had twice the
    opportunity to escape with the help of some officers who were his friends.
    But, he had said: I didn t do anything wrong to escape. A year after his
    execution, authorities gave some money to Mr. Jazayeri s family. Part of
    this money was his belated salaries and the family considered the rest as
    blood money. His family received his salary and benefits afterwards. They
    believe that all these facts indicate Mr. Jazayeri s innocence and
    officials acknowledgement of it. Judgment According to the existing
    information, the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Khoramabad condemned Mr.
    Naser Jazayeri to death as Mofsed (corruptor on Earth) for Murder and
    Assault and battery. The Public Prosecutor of Tehran, Rayshahri, confirmed
    the ruling. He was executed by firing squad at Evin prison in Tehran on
    June 11, 1979. His brother had seen bloody spots on the shroud in the
    chest area of the body. Mr. Jazayeri s body was buried at Behesht-e Zahra
    cemetery. The family experienced some difficulties afterwards including
    the prevention of Mr. Jazayeri s one brother from any state jobs. Mr.
    Naser Jazayeri was 29 years old.
