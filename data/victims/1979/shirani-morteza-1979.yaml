    Brigadier Morteza Shirani, former deputy police chief of Isfahan, is one
    of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report.
    The report lists defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals
    in the period from their inception until 12 August 1979. The list of
    victims and charges is drawn from sources including translations of
    indictments, reports of trials carried out by local and foreign media and
    the bulletins of the official Pars News Agency reports. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have executed individuals on trumped up
    charges such as drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.

    detention is available. Trial Amnesty International's report on this
    execution contains no information regarding the defendant's identity or
    trial. Charges The charges against Brigadier Shirani, according to the
    Amnesty International report, are: war on God; war on God's prophet and
    the deputy Imam Zaman, war against the representative of the Twelfth Imam;
    mass murder, massacre of innocent people; arson (of homes, shops and
    cars); collaborating with SAVAK; membership of a government council
    responsible for organizing and taking decisions; suppressing
    demonstrators, suppressing national and religious demonstrations,
    punishing demonstrators. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    on the evidence presented against Brigadier Shirani. Defense No
    information is available regarding the defense of the accused. Judgment
    Brigadier Morteza Shirani was sentenced to death and executed. No other
