    The execution of Mr. Ali Shahnazari and another individual from Harsin was
    reported by the correspondents of the Kayhan (October 8, 1979) and Enqelab
    Eslami (October 10, 1979) dailies in Kermanshah. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Based
    on the report, Mr. Shahnazari was charged with "murder and plunder, armed
    robbery, assault and battery of the revolutionaries, harassing Muslims in
    order to support the hated regime, carrying drugs, attacking the
    Revolutionary Guards, and blackmailing the oppressed people." The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be

    Evidence of guilt The Kayhan report referred to the testimonies of the

    details were provided. Judgment Based on the Enqelab Eslami report, the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kermanshah declared Mr. Shahnazari a
    "corruptor on earth" and an "enemy of God" and sentenced him to death. The
    sentence was carried out at 11 p.m. He was also ordered to hand over to
    the court the 120,000 Rials that he had allegedly taken forcefully from
    the people of Parireh Village.
