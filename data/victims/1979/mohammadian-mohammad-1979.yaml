    Mr. Mohammad Mohammadian is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980
    Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. Mr. Mohammadian's execution was also announced along with
    5 others in a communique issued by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Iran and published by the Ayandegan daily, on March 8, 1979. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges Mr. Mohammadian was charged with "acts incompatible with chastity,
    regarding minors." He was accused of being part of a group of corrupted
    people who "earned a living by forcing youngsters into corruption and
    indecent acts." Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohammadian's defense. Judgment
    Mr. Mohammadian was convicted and sentenced to death. No further
    information is available.
