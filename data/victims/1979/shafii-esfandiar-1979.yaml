    The execution of Mr. Esfandiar Shafi’i and his brother Satiar was
    announced in the Kayhan and the Jomhuri Eslami newspapers on December 8,
    1979. Kayhan wrote that they owned large pieces of land in Seifabad (Fars
    Province). Arrest and detention The details of Mr. Shafi’i’s arrest and
    detention are not known, other than he was arrested by the Revolutionary
    Guards of Kazerun (Fars Province). Trial Mr. Shafi’i was tried at the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kazerun. Charges According to Kayhan ,
    Mr. Shafi’i and his brother “had been involved in a street fight due to
    prior disagreements, which broke out a few months before and led to the
    death of 7 women and men.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Shafi’i’s defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kazerun condemned Mr. Shafi’i to death
    however, according to Kauhan , “the execution was to take place in Shiraz
    for certain reasons”. Mr. Esfandiar Shafi’i and his brother were executed
    by firing squad in Shiraz at 2 a.m. on December 7, 1979.
