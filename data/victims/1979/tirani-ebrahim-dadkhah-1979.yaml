    was a farmer and was very experienced in horticulture and especially in
    the cultivation of grapes, which were his favorite fruit. Information
    about the execution of Mr. Ebrahim Dadkhah Tirani, son of Monavar and
    Abolqasem, along with another person was published in Keyhan Newspaper on
    October 11, 1979. Additional information in this regard was obtained
    through Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interviews with a person close to
    Mr. Dadkhah Tirani on December 3, 2017 and March 30, 2018 (ABC interview),
    an ABC interview with a resident of Najaf Abad, a report published in the
    Etela at Newspaper, a report by a group of lawyers* (Lawyer s Report), ABC
    s research, and documents available at ABC. Mr. Dadkhah Tirani was born on
    October 29, 1928 in the Tiran area of Tiran and Karvan (or Karvand) County
    in Esfahan province. He was married with seven children (three daughters
    and four boys) and had elementary level education. His primary job was
    agriculture, and, according to a person close to him, he was very
    experienced in horticulture and especially in the cultivation of grapes,
    which were his favorite fruit. Due to Mr. Dadkhah Tirani s credibility and
    popularity in the Tiran area, he helped local authorities to resolve
    disputes among the residents of the city. Mr. Dadkhah Tirani was an active
    member of the Rastakhiz Party of Iran**. His acquaintances remember him as
    a very patriotic person. Background Before the 1979 revolution, Tiran
    County and the city of Najaf Abad had a disagreement over political issues
    and the rights to water resources. Mr. Dadkhah Tirani, as one of the most
    influential people in Tiran, tried to make Tiran the governor s center and
    remove Tiran from the authority of Najaf Abad s municipal governorate. The
    efforts of the representative of Tiran and Najaf Abad in the
    pre-revolutionary National Consultative Assembly to redirect the rivers
    which passed through Tiran to Najaf Abad, intensified the disputes. Since
    Mr. Dadkhah Tirani had worked to secure Tiran residents water resources
    rights for 25 years on behalf of the Esfahan provincial governorate, he
    was at the center of these disputes (ABC interview). A majority of the
    citizens of Najaf Abad were opposed to the Pahlavi government. Some of the
    influential leaders of the revolution were from this city. In December
    1978 (Muharram 1399), in the chaos preceding the revolution, events
    detailed below occurred in the city of Najaf Abad, which, after several
    months and with the victory of the Islamic Revolution, lead to the arrest
    of Mr. Dadkhah Tirani along with the head of the Gendarmerie in Tiran.
    These individuals were then charged with involvement in these incidents
    (ABC interview). According to the news published on the events of the
    10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th of Muharram, 1399 (December 11, 12, 13 and 14,
    1978), a report by a group of lawyers on this matter and ABC interviews,
    it is inferred that the events in Najaf Abad can be separated into three
    episodes: 1) Muharram 10th, 1399 (December 11, 1978): According to
    available information, a group of young people in Najaf Abad pulled down
    the statue of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi in the main square of the city on
    this day (ABC interview). 2) Muharram 11th and 12th, 1399 (December 12 and
    13, 1978): After the statue of the Shah was pulled down, a group of
    officers including municipal police and SAVAK (Organization of National
    Intelligence and Security) agents from the city of Najaf Abad along with a
    number of residents of the city of Yazdanshahr (a city near Najaf Abad
    with a mostly Lur population) in a punitive operation, identified the
    revolutionaries in the city, attacked their houses and stores, burned some
    of their houses and stores as well as the city s bazaar, broke many stores
    windows and plundered them, and assaulted many people in Najaf Abad and
    killed some of them (ABC interview and Lawyers Report). In the chaos
    preceding the revolution, some events occurred in the city of Najaf Abad,
    which, with the victory of the Islamic Revolution, lead to the arrest of
    Mr. Dadkhah Tirani. 3) Muharram 13th, 1399 (December 14, 1978): A large
    number of people from villages and towns near Najaf Abad (including Tiran
    County) were persuaded and organized by government officers to stage a
    stret protest in favor of the government in Esfahan. One of the residents
    of Tiran, who was a witness to the event, estimates that several thousand
    people in a long line of cars drove towards Esfahan. They carried pictures
    of the Shah and the flag of Iran and shouted Long Live the Shah . Military
    vehicles, at the beginning and end of the line, escorted and directed the
    cars. The caravan entered the city of Najaf Abad, passing toward Esfahan
    without any conflict. On the way out of the city of Najaf Abad, a number
    of tanks and military vehicles blocked the road, preventing the cars from
    going forward and forcing them to return. The eyewitness added that as the
    caravan was heading back, some Najaf Abad residents attacked the cars
