    Kayhan newspaper (January 24, and February 1, 1979; January-February 1979;
    March 27, and April 11, and 12, 1979); Ettela at newspaper (April 11,
    1979); Ayandegan newspaper (April 12, 1979); and ISNA (February 8, 2015).
    News of this execution was also published in Amnesty International s
    February-March 1980 report. * General Neshat was born in Tehran in 1923.
    Upon graduating from high school, and subsequently from the Military
    University, he began serving in the Guard Javidan or the Imperial Guard
    (literally meaning the Eternal Guard ). He was married and had five
    children. He was fluent in English and French. He was also an accomplished
    athlete and had obtained a multitude of medals in fencing, shooting
    (marksmanship), high jump, equestrian sports, and swimming. General Neshat
    was Moslem and a Safi Alishah Dervish. (Shirin Neshat s memoirs;
    Electronic form). General Neshat served in various cities including
    Behbahan, Tabriz, Chabahar, and Kermanshah. He was appointed Commander of
    the Imperial Guard in December 1978. He was deployed and positioned in all
    the locations where the Royal Family had residences, and had an office in
    both the Niavaran and Sa adabad Palaces. During his years of service, he
    had been awarded numerous medals and decorations. According to his
    daughter, General Neshat had great love and loyalty for his country and
    his king, and accompanied the Shah in all his domestic and international
    trips. (Shirin Neshat s memoirs). General Neshat is remembered as a
    diligent and hard-working man who never disrespected any one. According to
    his daughter, he was extremely kind, brave, serious, and honest, and
    treated his subordinates (his officers) as if they were his own children.
    (Shirin Neshat s memoirs). Background September 8, 1978 In the course of
    the 1978 protests, and more specifically on September 8, the day that came
    to be known as Black Friday, Yahya Nuri, a revolutionary cleric, called on
    the people to go to Jaleh Square and conduct a large protest demonstration
    against the government. The Tehran Military Commander had declared Martial
    Law at 6 o clock in the morning of that same day, prohibiting gatherings
    of more than 3 people. Military forces who had taken up positions in Jaleh
    Square since very early that morning, tried to disperse the protesters by
    calling on them [to leave] through loudspeakers as soon as they saw them.
    The protesters did not heed the calls, however, and defied them, resulting
    in the military opening fire on and killing a large number of the
    protesters. The September 8 events widened the rift and increased the
    tension between the people and the government. After Black Friday, there
    were more demonstrations and more extensive street skirmishes in cities
    across the country. The Tehran Military Command announced that there had
    been 87 dead and 205 wounded in the incident. The government opposition
    announced the number of people killed on September 8, was more than 4000,
    and stated that 500 people had been killed in Jaleh Square. According to
    the tally published years later based on documents available at the
    Islamic Revolution Shahid ( Martyr ) Foundation, 88 individuals had been
    killed on September 8, 64 in Jaleh Square and another 22 in other
    locations in Tehran. After the Islamic Revolution, revolutionary courts
    were established in most cities. On April 18, 1979, the Tehran Islamic
    Revolutionary Court tried six military officers on charges of direct
    participation in the September 8 killing. The Day of Ashura At 12 noon on
    December 11, 1978, the day of the Ashura (the day of the martyrdom of
    Hossein, the fourth Shiite Imam and the Prophet Mohammad s grandson), a
    soldier and a non-commissioned officer who had planned an attack on the
    Lavizan Military Base, carried out an assault on the Base cafeteria where
    there were a large number of officers present, opening fire and killing
    several people and ultimately getting killed themselves. (ISNA, February
    8, 2015). Dushan Tappeh On February 9, 1979, after the footage of
    Ayatollah Khomeini s arrival and welcoming ceremonies were shown at the
    Dushan Tappeh Air Force Base, a fight broke out between Air Force trainees
    who supported Khomeini, and the Imperial Guard, resulting in altercations
    and shootings. Once news of the rioting at the Air Force Base broke out, a
    group of revolutionaries went to Dushan Tappeh and entered the Base to
    assist the rioters. They accessed the arms depot, and once armed with
    rifles and machine guns, and u
