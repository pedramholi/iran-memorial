    News of the execution of Warrant Officer Hassan Jamali and another person,
    was published in the Kayhan newspaper on December 24, 1979. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial except that he was tried by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Dezful. Charges The charge against Warrant Officer Hassan
    Jamali, as reported by Kayhan , was announced as, “Murdering of Naser
    Bedakhanian on January 17, 1979 on the road to Andimeshk.” Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Jamali’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Dezful sentenced Mr. Hassan Jamali to death. The sentence was
    carried out by Dezful Islamic Revolutionary Guards at dawn on December 24,
    1979.
