    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Fallah and 5 other individuals was reported
    in the Kayhan daily on May 9, 1979. Mr. Fallah is also one of the 438
    victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The
    report lists defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in
    the period from their inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims
    and charges is drawn from sources including translations of indictments,
    reports of trials carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins
    of the official Pars News Agency reports. Arrest and detention No
    information about the circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention is available. Trial Based on the Kayhan report, the defendant’s
    case was examined at one of the branches of the Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Islamic Justice in Tehran. The report specified that the examination of 6
    cases, including this defendant's, at different branches of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal took almost a day; while the deliberation amongst
    the religious judges regarding all of the cases lasted for an hour and a
    half. Charges The indictment of the Public Prosecution Office of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran described the defendant’s charges
    as follows: “Mr. Mohammad Fallah, ID number 15010, issued in Tehran, is
    charged with the following: 1- Waging war against God, God’s Prophet and
    the representative of the twelfth Imam 2- Corruption on Earth 3- Murder
    and massacre of freedom-loving people who invite the oppressed mankind to
    justice and equality 4- Strengthening the anti-Islamic regime of the Shah
    by exerting pressure and oppression 5- Attempting to corrupt the young and
    active generation of our Muslim people 6- Blocking the path of God, the
    path to people’s happiness, the path to perfection and the path that
    allows the fulfillment of all the wishes of the people. 7- Using Middle
    Ages style torture against the best offspring of the world” Evidence of
    guilt The indictment, as reported in the Kayhan daily, listed the evidence
    presented against the defendant as follows: “1- Forthright as well as
    indirect confessions of the accused during the interrogations 2- Having
    anti-people positions and serving loyally in the detested Intelligence and
    Security Organization of the country, which had no aim but the destruction
    of this people 3- The testimony of the clear conscience of our free and
    Muslim society who considers these elements anti-God and anti-People” The
    public prosecutor continued: “Based on the above and considering the
    Koranic verses, the Hadith of the Saints, and the principles of freedom
    and justice derived from the Koran, I request that the above-named be
    punished” There was no mention of testimonies or evidence regarding
    specific incidents of murder, torture, intimidation, or corruption
    involving the defendant during the trial. Defense The Kayhan reporter
    mentioned that following the lecture of the indictment, the Judge asked
    the accused to stand before the investigative judges and respond to
    questions. The accused was questioned about his job, his involvement in
    unspecified clashes with the guerillas, his use of arms to cause fear, his
    knowledge about the use of torture, and his reasons for not having
    resigned. The defendant, talking in his own defense, stated that he had
    been initially an archivist in the intelligence section of the Police but
    had been assigned to a patrol team upon joining the Joint Committee
    because the archives were taken care of by the Intelligence and Security
    Organization. He also stressed that during his two and a half years of
    patrolling he had not been involved in any clashes. He referred to several
    incidents that were mentioned to him during his interrogation and denied
    any involvement in any of those incidents and denied having made use of a
    fire arm. The defendant admitted to having participated in the arrest of
    two people, an un-named girl who was released and a man named Hushmand
    Khamenei, who was arrested in Esfahan and then sent to Tehran. Mr. Fallah
    stressed that the latter was armed and had resisted arrest and had tried
    to shoot him. Mr. Fallah also admitted to having heard later that the
    arrested person had been killed under torture in Tehran. .But he
    repeatedly denied having been involved in any armed clashes or having
    carried a fire arm. The judge expressed skepticism regarding the veracity
    of the defendant’s statements and noted that “...if you participated in
    such arrests and then realized that people died under torture, how come
    you still joined the Joint Committee in 1977? So you are guilty of
    complicity in murder. …Would people surrender to you if you didn’t carry
    arms? …You were terrorizing people. This is being a corruptor. The armed
    robbers, I call them enemies of God and corruptors and this is the crime
    of anyone who has arms. You have to say that you regret….” At last, the
    presiding judge said: “We know that those who served at the Committee had
    a thousand different faces: some were tou
