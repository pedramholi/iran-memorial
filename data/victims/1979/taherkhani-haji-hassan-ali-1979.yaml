circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Haji Hassan Ali Taherkhani was announced in the
    Kayhan newspaper on August 19, 1979. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Taherkhani’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial Mr. Taherkhani was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Takestan (in today’s Qazvin province). The trial began at 9 p.m. on August
    18, 1979 “in the presence of a group of people.” Charges Mr. Taherkhani
    was charged with “distribution of heroin and opium.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Taherkhani’s defense. Judgment
    The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Takestan condemned Mr. Haji Hassan
    Ali Taherkhani to death. He and another individual were shot by a firing
    squad in Qazvin at 2:30 a.m. on August 19, 1979, five and a half hours
    after the beginning of their trial.
