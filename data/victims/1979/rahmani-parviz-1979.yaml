    The execution of Mr. Parviz Rahmani was announced in the Kayhan newspaper
    on August 19, 1979. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Rahmani’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Mr. Rahmani was tried
    at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Takestan (in today’s Qazvin
    province). The trial began at 9 p.m. on August 18, 1979 “in the presence
    of a group of people.” Charges Mr. Rahmani was charged with “distribution
    and transfer of heroin from Hamedan to Qazvin.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Rahmani’s defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Takestan condemned Mr. Parviz Rahmani to
    death. He and another individual were shot by a firing squad in Qazvin at
    2:30 a.m. on August 19, 1979, five and a half hours after the beginning of
    their trial.
