    The execution of Mr. Ja’far Rashidi, a worker at the Tabriz car factory
    and a resident of Azarshahr (East Azarbaijan Province), was reported by
    the correspondent of the Kayhan newspaper in Tabriz (September 25, 1979).
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial There is no information about the trial.
    Charges Mr. Rashidi was charged with “deluding a 13-year-old boy named
    Qanbar Ali Dara’i in Tehran two days ago and taking him to Azarshahr,
    where he and other men raped the youth.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Tabriz sentenced Mr. Rashidi to 100 lashes and death. He was shot by
    firing squad at 9:30 p.m. on September 24, 1979 in Tabriz. According to
    the newspaper, “the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal condemned the deluded
    youth and the other two rapists to 100 and 80 lashes respectively.”
