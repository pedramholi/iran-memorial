    information, Mr. Tofiqian was a fifth year Mathematics student at Esfahan
    University. After the 1979 revolution, he started to work with the
    workers, particularly the unemployed workers in Esfahan. He was a
    well-known figure among the political activists in Esfahan and he worked
    as a welder. In the demonstrations, he helped to put the requests of the
    workers in writing and to take these to the authorities. In the timeline
    of the Martyrs of the Razmandegan Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class, Mr. Tofiqian is named as a supporter of this organization
    (Conversations in Prison, August 30, 2021). Paykar Organization first
    named Mr. Tofiqian as one of their supporters, but according to what was
    said in their 1981 publication, Comrade Naser was an activist in the event
    known as Line 3 and he was closer to our organization and to our
    political-ideological policies than any other group. (Paykar Publication
    number 100 April 6, 1981). On April 7, 1979, Mr. Tofiqian participated in
    demonstrations alongside unemployed workers in Esfahan, seeking resolution
    for their requests. The Razmandegan Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class The Razmandegan Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded in the winter of 1979. Its activities were
    focused on the working class and factories. The founding tenets of
    Razmandegan included the rejection of armed struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. It viewed the
    Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state and believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles. Razmandegan was among the
    groups that became known as Khat-e Se (Third line). By early 1981,
    disagreements on the Party s position on the Iran-Iraq war caused internal
    splits in Razmandegan. These splits, which coincided with the massive and
    brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian government, caused the
    Organization to disband. Demonstrations of Unemployed Workers in Esfahan
    1979 After the triumph of the 1979 revolution, Iran was hit with an
    unprecedented wave of unemployment. Thousands of companies and factories
    suspended their operations and many Iranian and foreign managers left
    Iran, either before or after the revolution. This caused many industrial
    and construction projects to be permanently or temporarily shut down.
    According to records, just in Tehran, about 3,000 employees of
    restaurants, nightclubs, and luxury theaters were unemployed. Shutting
    down the National Lottery Ticket resulted in 200,000 low-income ticket
    sellers to become unemployed. As a result, in the first few months after
    the revolution, about 2.5 million people, representing 21 percent of the
    workforce, lost their jobs. In reaction to this situation, labor movements
    and labor organizations were formed all over the country. In towns like
    Tehran, Abadan, Sanandaj, Kermanshah, and Tabriz, unemployed were
    unionized in order to claim their rights. In Esfahan, after foreign
    factories and companies such as Fluor (who were building the Esfahan
    Refinery with 9,000 workers), acrylic (with more than 4,000 workers), Bell
    Helicopter (about 3,000 workers), and military industries shut down, many
    workers lost their jobs. Also, construction workers and those working in
    retail, having not been paid in many months, faced financial difficulties.
    In reaction to this situation, unemployed workers gathered in the Rasuli s
    Mosque in Esfahan in February 1979 and requested their back pay and the
    resumption of work. As the numbers of protesters increased, all the
    officials did was to direct them to a venue farther away and almost out of
    town, called Khane Kargar . The gathering at Khane Kargar culminated in
    the formation of the Union of Unemployed Workers in Esfahan and Environs
    in March 1979, which organized the widespread demonstrations of the
    workers. Initially, the workers chose 8 representatives from among
    themselves who were mostly industrial and technical workers from Esfahan.
