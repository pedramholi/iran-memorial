    Mr. Yahollah Shadani (Esfahdiari) is one of 438 victims listed in a March
    13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who
    were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their
    inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn
    from sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials
    carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official
    Pars News Agency reports. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have executed individuals on trumped up charges such as drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and
    detention No information regarding the defendant's arrest and detention is
    available. Trial Amnesty International's report on this execution contains
    no information regarding the defendant's identity or trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Shadani , as listed in the report, are: corruption on
    earth; war on God; war on God's prophet and the deputy Imam Zaman; war
    against the representative of the Twelfh Imam; insulting the religious
    groups, insulting Muslim prisoners; slander and injury to the people; mass
    murder; torture. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Shadani. Defense No information is
    available regarding the defense of the accused. Judgment The defendant was
    sentenced to death and executed. No other details are available.
