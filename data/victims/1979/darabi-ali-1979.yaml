circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ali Darabi, an employee of the Kuhdasht Judiciary,
    was announced in the Enqelab Eslami and Kayhan dailies of September 2,
    1979. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The defendant was charged with "adultery and
    illegitimate marriage with an already married woman." Evidence of guilt
    The reports of this execution do not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment The religious judge at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Khorramabad sentenced Mr. Darabi to death. He
    was executed in the morning. Based on the Kayhan report, the woman with
    whom the defendant allegedly had an illegitimate relationship was
    sentenced to 100 lashes.
