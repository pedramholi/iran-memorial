circumstances: >
    The information regarding Mr. Afshin Mohamadzadeh’s execution along with 6
    others was drawn from Kayhan Daily on 22 December 1979. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Mohamadzadeh’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial The Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashhad tried Mr.
    Mohamadzadeh. Charges Kayhan Daily reported Mr. Mohamadzadeh’s charges as
    “sodomy (specifically receiving) and distributing drugs inside and outside
    the prison.” Evidence of guilt No information is available concerning the
    evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available concerning Mr. Mohamadzadeh’s defense and it is not clear if he
    had the opportunity to defend himself effectively, for example whether he
    had access to a lawyer or the possibility to summon witnesses in his
    favor, etc. Regardless of the legitimacy of criminalization of a person’s
    sexual orientation, the validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offenses. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Judgment The Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Mashhad sentenced Mr. Mohamadzadeh to death. This verdict was carried out
    at dawn on 21 December 1979.
