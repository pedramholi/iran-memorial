    The execution of Mr. Hasan Peyro, a driver and the 24-year-old father of
    three, was reported by the correspondent of the Kayhan daily in Shiraz
    (August 30, 1979). The Enqelab Eslami daily of September 1, 1979 also
    published the news. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown Arrest and detention Based on the Kayhan
    report, the defendant was arrested by the Air Force officials of Shiraz
    and handed over to the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecution Office.
