    He owned the land he farmed near Qazvin. Seven children in the family and
    no political ties to claim. Mr. Kamran Mafi is one of 438 victims listed
    in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists
    defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period
    from their inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges
    is drawn from sources including translations of indictments, reports of
    trials carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the
    official Pars News Agency reports. The news of this execution, along with
    that of two military personnel, was also reported in the Kayhan daily on
    May 26 and 31, 1979. The former report quotes the official communiqu of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qazvin. The first Head of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunals, Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali mentions the execution
    and trial of Mr. Mafi in his memoirs (Sayeh Publishers, Tehran). Further
    information regarding Mr. Mafi s case was sent to Omid via electronic
    forms by one of his children and a person familiar with this case, who
    wishes to remain anonymous. According to the information available on
    these forms, Mr. Mafi, a father of 7, was a landowner and a farmer in the
    Qazvin area. He had no political affiliation. He was once arrested at the
    end of April 1979, but was freed after the court found him innocent.
    Arrest and detention According to the information available on the
    electronic forms, Mr. Mafi s brother was arrested by the authorities and
    kept as bait for two months, so that they could find out Mr. Mafi s
    whereabouts. He was arrested for the second time on May 16, 1979 when
    Revolutionary Guards raided his house in Tehran, shooting as they entered.
    The order for his arrest is believed to have come from the head of the
    Qazvin Committee and he was taken to the Committee by the Revolutionary
    Guards without a proper arrest warrant. He was reportedly tortured in
    prison. When his body was returned to his family after his execution, he
    had bruises and a broken arm. The committee never informed his family of
    any reason for his arrest. He was denied visits in prison and the right to
    have an attorney. The authorities repeatedly told Mr. Mafi s family that
    he would be released in a few days. Mr. Mafi was detained for 8 days
    before his execution. Trial Based on Khalkhali s memoirs: Mr. Sheikh
    Qodrat Alikhani and a few others from Qazvin came to visit Emam [Khomeini]
    and requested that I go to Qazvin for the trial of some criminals. By Emam
    s orders, I went to Qazvin and I tried 3 people and executed them the same
    night and I also defrocked and exiled 12 men pretending to be men of
    religion Kayhan daily s report of the Islamic Revolutionary courts
    communiqu also confirms that on May 22, 1979 the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Qazvin tried several individuals including Kamran Mafi. Charges
    According to the newspaper report, Mr. Mafi, along with Major Tufani, and
    Soldier Gheiz Ali Roshpardaz, were collectively charged with having
    previous criminal records, shootings, murder, and being corruptors on
    earth. It is not clear whether there was any connection between the three
    defendants, and if Mr. Mafi was found guilty of all charges or whether he
    was guilty of a specific charge. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense Mr. Mafi s family stresses that he
    was innocent and was executed for being against the revolution. Judgment
    The Qazvin Revolutionary Court declared Mr. Mafi a corruptor on earth and
    sentenced him to death. According to Khalkhali s memoires, Mr. Mafi was
    executed hours after the end of his trial. He was executed by a firing
    squad at 4:30 a.m. in Qazvin. After his execution his father filed an
    official complaint against the local Committee. The authorities threatened
    to execute him if he did not withdraw his complaint. They told him to stop
    probing into the matter if he wanted to stay alive. All of Mr. Mafi s
    property was confiscated by the Bonyad Mostaz afan (Foundation of the
    Oppressed, a governmental organization) after his execution.
