    Mr. Ali Dudafkan is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty
    International report. The report lists defendants who were convicted by
    Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception until 12 August
    1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from sources including
    translations of indictments, reports of trials carried out by local and
    foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News Agency reports.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have executed
    individuals on trumped up charges such as drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention No information
    regarding the defendant's arrest and detention is available. Trial Amnesty
    International's report on this execution contains no information regarding
    the defendant's identity or trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Ali
    Daud Afghan, as listed in the Amnesty International report, are: indecent
    assault and homosexual rape. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    regarding the evidence presented against this defendant. Defense No
    information is available regarding the defense of the accused. Judgment A
    communique issued by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Iran and
    published by the daily Ayandegan on March 8 specified that: "six people
    among the individuals convicted by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Iran for enticing and sexually abusing minors and earning a living by
    forcing them into prostitution were shot."
