    Son of Zia ollah and Tabandeh, the once-young military student would earn
    a Pahlavi-era Order of Military Merit and a position as an air force
    officer s assistant. Colonel Azematollah (also spelled " Azamatu'llah")
    Fahandej, son of Zia ollah and Tabandeh, is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is
    listed in a 1993 report published by the Baha i International Community.
    The report documents the persecution of the members of the Baha i faith in
    the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978.
    Additional information has been drawn from various issues of The Baha i
    World (see for example: Vol. XIX, 1982-1986, Haifa 1994). The information
    about him has been drawn from a book by Ms. Mahmehr Golestaneh, called A
    Tribute to the Faithful . His execution was announced in the Kayhan
    newspaper (Dec. 8 9, 1979) and Jomhuri Eslami (Dec. 9, 1979). Colonel
    Fahandej was born on January 4, 1937 in Sa di Village, Fars Province.
    Having finished elementary school there, he moved to Shiraz to study in
    high school. He then enrolled in the high school of the armed forces, and
    later in the military school in Tehran. He was promoted to the rank of
    second colonel and received a military merit medal. He served in different
    cities until he became the assistant of an air force officer in Shiraz. He
    was a husband a father of two. On December 13, 1978, a group of
    unidentified individuals attacked the house of Colonel Fahandej s cousin,
    who was killed, among others, in the shootings that ensued. The next day,
    houses of many Baha is in the area were set on fire. Following the
    incident, Colonel Fahandej moved to Tehran and started working there. A
    few weeks later, some individuals accused Colonel Azematollah Fahandej of
    being the mastermind of the attack. His house in Shiraz was raided and
    looted. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979*- to systematic harassment and
    persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The
    Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic
    Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result,
    the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status of a
    religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are
    banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice
    has subjected them to abuse and violence.** Persecution of Baha is in Iran
    is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era
    that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself,
    supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and
    in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from
    France to Iran, in response to a question regarding political and
    religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government,
    Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they are harmful
    and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked
    another question: Will they be free to perform their religious rites? The
    Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i
    threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national security
    in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention
    Colonel Fahandej was arrested in Tehran on April 7, 1979. According to Ms.
    Golestaneh s book, he was interrogated at Youth Palace in Shiraz and
    detained at Adelabad prison from April 16 to November 27, 1979, during
    which he had visits twice a week. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    of Fars Province held a session on November 25, 1979 to try Colonel
    Fahandej, without his prior knowledge. Charges The Kayhan newspaper refers
    to Mr. Fahandej as one of the agents of the massacre in Sa di village. The
    newspaper report mentions that through involvement with the clashes he
    caused the death of two persons and injury to some. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt Ms.
    Golestaneh s book refers to witnesses for Colonel Fahandej and witnesses
    who testified against him in court. Defense According to the available
    information, Colonel Fahandej was not present at the site of the incident
    on December 13, 1978; he spent that night in his house, located near the
    Azadi Park in Shiraz, in the presence of his wife, his brother and
    sister-in-law, as well as his two children. Mr. Fahandej did not have the
    opportunity to defend himself at the trial. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Fars Province condemned Colonel Azematollah
    Fahandej to death. He was shot in public by firing squad on December 7,
    1979 at 9:30 p.m. in Shiraz. -------------------------------- * Slow Death
