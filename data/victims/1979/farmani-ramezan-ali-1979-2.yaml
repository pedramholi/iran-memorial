    from sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials
    carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official
    Pars News Agency reports. Additional information about Major Farmani has
    been sent to Omid via an electronic form. According to this source, he was
    married and had four children. He graduated from the military college. The
