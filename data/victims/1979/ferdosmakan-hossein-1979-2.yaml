    News of the execution of Colonel Hossein Ferdosmakan, son of Mohammad Ali,
    was obtained through an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center with a person who knew him (June 3, 2019), and from an electronic
    form submitted by another person close to him (May 27, 2019). News of this
    execution and that of 21 other individuals was also published in
    Ayandegan, Ettela at, and Kayhan newspapers (May 8, 1979). Additional
    information about this case was obtained from an interview with a former
    Gendarmerie colonel who knew Colonel Ferdosmakan (February 6, and 8,
    2021), from the Boroumand Center s research and interviews with
    eyewitnesses to the pro-Government and pro-Constitution demonstrations on
    January 25, 1979 (June 3, 2019, July 15, 2020, and October-December 2020),
    the Islamic Revolution Prosecutor s Office s letter (July 2, 1979), Mr.
    Ferdosmakan s last will, Ettela at newspaper (January 23, 24, 25, 29, 30,
    and 31, 1979, and February 5, 1979), Kayhan newspaper (January 25, and 29,
    1979), and other sources*. Colonel Ferdosmakan is one of 438 individuals
    whose execution was announced in Amnesty International s March 1980
    report. In this report, Amnesty International compiled and published a
    list of defendants in Revolutionary Tribunals from the latter s inception
    until July-August 1979, based on reports by Iranian and foreign media, as
    well as the official Pars News Agency. Colonel Ferdosmakan was born in
    1930-31 in the city of Babol. He was married and had three children. After
    obtaining his diploma from Tehran s Military [High] School, he attended
    and graduated from [the city of] Shiraz War University. He served for a
    time as an officer in the Army of the [Imperial] Armed Forces in [the
    cities of] Bandar Abbas, Sari, and Kerman. According to people close to
    him, at the request of the officials then in charge of the Gendarmerie who
    were in need of honest individuals in that force, Colonel Ferdosmakan, who
    was known as a person of honesty, integrity, and responsibility, served in
    the [cities of] Fassa, Qom, and Ardebil Gendarmerie from 1966-67 until
    1977-78, with the rank of Colonel and as regiment commander. Colonel
    Ferdosmakan was transferred to Tehran a little over a year before the
    Revolution and served as Commander of Tehran Gendarmerie s 24 Esfand (
    March 14 ) Base. (Boroumand Center interviews, June 8, 2019, and February
    6, 2021). Persons close to Colonel Ferdosmakan have described him as a
    simple and patriotic man who loved his work and the Shah, who would spend
    months away from his family on various missions, and who never used his
    position to amass wealth. After his death, there was a mere 18 Tumans
    (equivalent to roughly 2.50 Dollars at the time) in Colonel Ferdosmakan s
    bank account. A person with knowledge of the case and who knew Colonel
    Ferdosmakan very closely, described him as a highly respected and popular
    officer, well-educated and extremely kind, who treated the people below
    him with kindness and respect. According to people close to him, even
    though he had the opportunity to leave Iran, he had no desire to do so,
    and in response to a direct offer from a high-ranking military official,
    he had said I will not leave Iran alone when it s on fire . (Boroumand
    Center interviews, June 3, 2019, and February 6, 2021). After the 1979
    Revolution, Colonel Ferdosmakan did not go to work for a month and a half,
    and lived with one of his relatives for a while. He returned to his home a
    few days prior to his arrest. (Boroumand Center interview, June 3, 2019).
    Colonel Ferdosmakan s case is related to the clashes in Tehran s 24 Esfand
    Square on January 28, 1979. The January 28, 1979 Event On January 5, 1979,
    as the popular protests in the fall of 1978 and winter of 1979 reached an
    apex, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, relegated the position of
    Prime Minister to Shapur Bakhtiar, one of his political opponents and
    Secretary General of the Iran Party, who had been one of the leaders of
    Jebheye Melli Iran or the Iranian National Front until January 1979. In
    his political platform, Mr. Bakhtiar insisted on political freedom within
    the framework of the law, and had said that the law even provided for a
    change in the political regime, and that the people could make decisions
    regarding their [political] destiny through elections. Ayatollah Khomeini
    who had by then settled in Paris, had called Shapur Bakhtiar s government
    illegal in his speeches, interviews and messages, and had said:
    Cooperating with this usurper government, in any form or fashion, is Haram
    ( strictly forbidden by Islamic law ) and legally a crime. **(Sahifeye
    Noor, Volume Five) In the last days of January, strikes, reactions to the
    news of Ayatollah Khomeini s return, and the breakdown of the Prime
    Minister s negotiations with Ayatollah Khomeini and his entourage,
    intensified the tension between the two sides. On the government s orders,
    Mehrabad Airport was closed off on January 24, 1979, and that same night,
