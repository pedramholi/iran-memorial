    The execution of Mr. Hassan Abdoli and three others was reported by the
    correspondent of the Pars News Agency in Kermanshah and published in the
    Enqelab Eslami daily (October 6, 1979). The Kermanshah correspondent of
    the Kayhan newspaper, too, reported the news, quoting the communiqué of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kermanshah regarding the case
    (October 6, 1979). The communiqué reads as follows: "Now that the
    magnificent Revolution of the Muslim people of Iran and the firm and
    uncompromising leadership of Imam Khomeini have destroyed the palace of
    Arrogance in this land, everybody is expecting that their wishes for
    achieving Islamic brotherhood and equality, living freely in a God-fearing
    society, and uprooting corruption and corruptors will come true. It is
    towards such a goal that the sword of Islamic Justice has come out of the
    sleeve of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals and everyday enemies of God
    and the people and violators of people's lives, livelihoods, and honor
    fall off on the lowest grounds of degradation and the society is cleansed
    from the stain of their filthy existence." Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr.
    Abdoli was charged with “martyring, rape, and sodomy.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment Mr. Hassan Abdoli was sentenced to
    death. The sentence was carried out the at 9:30 pm same evening.
