    Captain Shafiq was the nephew of Iran s Monarch, but he chose to remain
    close to his men and live in the same conditions they lived in rather than
    live a privileged life at the Court. His men feared and loved him.
    Information about the life and extrajudicial execution of Captain Shahriar
    Mustapha Shafiq (Chafiq), a high ranking officer of the Imperial Iranian
    Navy, was drawn from the interviews of Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for
    Human Rights in Iran with an informed source (February 29, 2024) and with
    a person close to the family (March 3, 2024), Agence France Press,
    December 14, 1979, France Inter (French radio) December 9, 1979, and
    France s Journal Officiel dated March 25 and September 30, 2010.
    Additional information was drawn from the Ettela at daily, December 27,
    1979 and January 22, 1980; and the Memoirs of Ayatollah Khalkhali, the
    first religious judge appointed by Ayatollah Khomeini to preside over the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal. Further information was taken from the
    Kayhan newspaper dated 8 December 1979; The Washington Post, December 8
    and 9, 1979; a Facebook page assigned to Mr. Shafiq; the official website
    of Princess Ashraf Pahlavi; and the Qoqnus website. Mr. Shafiq, son of
    Ahmad Shafiq and Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, married and father of two, was
    born in Cairo, Egypt, on March 15, 1945. He was the second child of
    Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, twin sister of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. His
    father, Ahmad Shafiq, was a son of the former Minister of Egypt s royal
    court and a director of commercial aviation companies in Egypt. Shahriar
    Shafiq studied at Razi High School in Tehran and continued his studies in
    the Britannia Royal Naval School (BRNS) in Dartmouth, United Kingdom.
    While studying at the Naval College, he was presented the Sword of Honor.
    Shafiq was also an athlete. In March 1978, he was appointed as the head of
    Iran s Judo and Karate Federation. Captain Shafiq started his career at
    the age of 21 in the Imperial Iranian Navy as a Lieutenant Commander of
    the Bayandor Destroyer in Khoramshahr. He completed two naval tours of
    duty in the United States. In 1971, he commanded the Hovercraft strike
    force that recovered the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser
    Tunbs for Iran. He was appointed as the Commander of the Imperial Iranian
    Navy s destroyer fleet in 1975 and he commanded the Navy s hovercraft
    fleet. Sources close to the family told ABC that Captain Shafiq was a man
    of action. During the time of the war in Oman (1972-77), for example, when
    one of Iran's (F-4) Phantoms crashed behind enemy lines, he led a commando
    team behind the lines to recover the sensitive technology onboard the
    plane so it would not fall into enemy hands. Informed sources pointed out
    to ABC that Captain Shafiq was a humble, disciplined, ethical, and skilled
    officer who showed little interest in titles or the Court s life, an
    officer who did not separate himself from his men and lived in the same
    conditions as they did. (Interviews with an informed source, February 29,
    2024 and a person close to the family, March 3, 2024) Iran s then
    Commander in Chief, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, remembered Captain Shafiq
    as a naval officer who was loved, respected and admired by the men who
    served under him. His policy was to eat, sleep and work side by side with
    his men, be it in the heat of the Persian Gulf or at sea. He shunned any
    privileges of his position. His devotion to the needy Iranian people of
    the region where he was stationed was well known. (Eulogy released by the
    Shah of Iran, Reuters, December 7, 1979) Shahriar Shafiq fled from
    Bandar-e Abbas, Iran, to Kuwait about one month after the victory of the
    Islamic Revolution, narrowly escaping being arrested by representatives of
    the new regime by taking a patrol boat across the Persian Gulf, while
    being chased by regime forces. He settled his family in California, but
    came to Paris on November 14, 1979, presumably, to be closer to Iran, and
    to engage in political work. He stayed at a house on the Villa Dupont
    owned by his mother where his sister, Azadeh, resided and from where she
    oversaw the publication of a newspaper called Iran Libre (Iran-e Azad).
    (Le Monde, December 10, 1979) Being a man of action, he had not given up
    on liberating Iran and he was not going to settle down in Europe. He
    thought that the army should act. He was in touch with his team in the
    navy and had traveled multiple times to Turkey. (Interview with a source
    close to the family, March 3, 2024) According to his mother, Mr. Shafiq
    was a person of character, integrity and principle. He was generous,
    selfless and unswervingly patriotic. He was a soldier, willing to
    sacrifice greatly for his country and people. (Princess Ashraf Pahlavi s

    motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the 1979
