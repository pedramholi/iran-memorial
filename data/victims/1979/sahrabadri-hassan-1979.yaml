    Mr. Hassan Sahrabadri is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980
    Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. This execution was also announced in the Kayhan newspaper
    on July 16, 1979. Additional information about this case was provided to
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center via an electronic form by a person familiar
    with his case (e-form February 23, 2021). Mr. Sahrabadri was born in
    Dezful in 1953/54. He had a middle school education. He was single and
    worked as a driver. Arrest and detention Mr. Sahrabadri was arrested in
    Dezful in 1978/79, and was detained at Unesco prison. Trial Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Dezful (Khuzestan province) tried Mr. Sahrabadri.
    Charges According to the Kayhan newspaper, Mr. Sahrabadri was charged with
    several counts of acts incompatible with chastity, and sodomy, through
    intimidation. The validity of the criminal charges brought against Mr.
    Sahrabadri cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt There is no information about any evidence
    presented against Mr. Sahrabadri. According to the electronic form, no
    charges were presented at the time of his arrest. Defense There is no
    information on Mr. Sahrabadri s defense. Judgment In accordance with the
    verdict of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Dezful, Mr. Sahrabadri was
    executed by a firing squad at dawn on July 16, 1979 in Dezful. He was
    buried quietly and unceremoniously.
