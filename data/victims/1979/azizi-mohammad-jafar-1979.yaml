    Information about Mr. Mohammad Ja’far Azizi has been drawn from an
    interview with a relative, the book Sahifeh-ye Emam by Ayatollah Khomeini,
    volume 9, the book Ayam-e Enzava (Times of Solitude) by Ayatollah
    Khalkhali, the Kayhan newspaper dated 19 and 23 Aug. 1979 (in which his
    name was mistyped “Mohammad Safar”), and the report “The Demise of Sadeq
    Khalkhali” by Mansur Boluri (Iranian Political Bulletin, 30 November
    2003). Mr. Azizi was an employee of the Social Security Organization of
    Paveh (Kermanshah province). He lived with his mother and was not
    affiliated with any political party of organization. Mr. Azizi’s execution
    was part of a wave of executions that took place in order to combat the
    “anti-Revolutionary” elements in Kurdistan region. Following the
    negotiations between the PDKI and the interim prime minister, several
    clashes occurred, at times armed, between the Revolutionary Guards and the
    peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI) particularly in the cities of Sanandaj
    (Kordestan province) and Paveh (Kermanshah province). These intensifying
    conflicts between the new central Shiite government of Iran and the mainly
    Sunni region of Kurdistan concerned the role of minorities in the drafting
    of the constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state
    religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region. Subsequent to
    conflicts that resulted in some casualties, on August 18, 1979, Ayatollah
    Khomeini issued an order to the military and the armed forces to “move to
    Paveh and end the fighting…” In the same order, he encouraged them to use
    force and threatened that: “if they do not move toward Paveh within 24
    hours with missiles and tanks and all necessary arsenals, I will hold them
    accountable. And in case of any infringement of this order, I will treat
    them in a Revolutionary manner” ( Sahifeh-ye Emam , p. 285). On August 19,
    Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the “party of Satan” and declared it
    “unofficial and illegal” noting that some of these “anti-Islamic”
    individuals had boycotted the referendum of April 1, when people went to
    polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime ( ibid p. 311). In
    accordance with Khomeini’s order, Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali traveled the
    western region of Iran and told a reporter from the Ettela’at newspaper:
    “I will visit all areas of Kurdistan… and will bring to justice anybody
    who was involved in these bloody plots” ( Times of Solitude p. 96).
    According to Mr. Boluri, Ayatollah Khalkhali condemned at least 58 Kurds
    to death in the span of 10 days. Mass executions and conflicts continued
    for many months in that region. Arrest and detention According to the
    interviewee, on August 18, 1979, the Revolutionary Guardsmen came to Mr.
    Azizi’s house in order to arrest him. They entered the house by force. His
    mother, Ms. Ra’na Azizi, tried to stop them and prevent her son’s arrest.
    She was shot and killed. Mr. Azizi, who was also wounded, was arrested and
    taken to Dizelabad prison of Kermanshah. Until his execution, Mr. Azizi
    was detained for several hours. Trial No information is available on the
    court session. The religious judge in Kermanshah denied “the rumors of
    execution of leftists without trial” ( Kayhan ). Charges According to
    Kayhan , Mr. Azizi and ten other individuals were collectively charged
    with “corruption on earth and being at war with God and his prophet.”
    Evidence of guilt The newspaper report refers to “interrogation” and
    “testimony of witnesses” as evidence against Mr. Azizi. No further
    information is available about the evidence and witnesses’ testimony.
    Defense No information is available concerning Azizi’s defense. Judgment
    The Tribunal called Mr. Mohammad Ja’far Azizi and 10 other individuals
    “corruptors on earth and at war with God and his prophet” and condemned
    them to death. They were shot by a firing squad at 2:40 a.m. on August 19,
    1979 in Dizelabad prison.
