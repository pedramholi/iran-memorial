circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Sheikh Hamed Ravidat was announced by the Public
    Prosecutor of Abadan and Khoramshahr, quoted by the Pars News Agency (
    Enqelab Eslami newspaper, September 30, 1979). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    defendant was charged with the following: “Smuggling arms and ammunitions
    such as RPG 7, grenades, etc. and distributing them among people, inciting
    and encouraging people to armed uprising, participation in killing the
    defenseless people of Khoramshahr, connection to anti-revolutionary
    elements, and helping the allies of the detested Pahlavi regime escape the
    country.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Abadan and Khoramshahr
    sentenced Mr. Ravidat to death and he was immediately executed.
