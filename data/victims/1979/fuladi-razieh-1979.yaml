    She was the mother of four children in Saveh. Her husband, Ne mat, took
    his grief public in a letter that was published in Enqelab-e Eslami , in
    Tehran. The information about the execution of Ms. Razieh Fuladi, mother
    of 4, was published in the newspaper Enqelab-e Eslami on September 1,
    1979. The protest letter written by her husband, Mr. Barak Nil, to
    Ayatollah Khomeini was published in the same newspaper on February 20,
    1980. In his letter, the victim's husband wrote: "I, her husband, had no
    complaint against my wife. All our neighbors know that she was innocent
    and pure. Now, I am left alone with four young children and do not know
    what to do." International human rights organizations have drawn attention
    to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against these defendants
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Ms. Fuladi's arrest and
    detention are described in her spouse's letter as follows: "On August 27,
    1979 they took her to the Revolutionary Committee of Saveh. There they
    flogged her repeatedly, and under duress they forced her to lie and
    confess to adultery." Trial No information is available on the defendant s
    trial except that the trial took place less than 72 hours after the
    arrest. Charges The defendant was charged with adultery. Evidence of guilt
    The verdict was based on the defendant's confession. Defense There is no
    information about Ms. Fuladi's defense; however, her husband, in the above
    mentioned letter, denied the charge against her as well as the validity of
    a confession obtained under torture. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Saveh issued a death sentence against Ms. Fuladi. She was
    executed three days after her arrest on Thursday, at 3:35 am. The man
    charged with having committed adultery with the defendant was sentenced to
    100 lashes.
