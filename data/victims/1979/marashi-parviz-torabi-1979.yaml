    Information about the execution of Mr. Parviz Torabi Mar ashi, son of
    Hassan Ali, has been drawn from an electronic form sent to Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center by a person close to him on May 19, 2023. Mr. Torabi Mar
    ashi is also one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty
    International report. The report lists defendants who were convicted by
    Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception until 12 August
    1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from sources including
    translations of indictments, reports of trials carried out by local and
    foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News Agency reports.

    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offenses, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Evidence of guilt No
    information is available on the evidence presented against Mr. Torabi Mar
    ashi. Defense No information is available on the defense. Judgment Mr.
