    Information regarding Mr. Mirahmad Ma’sumi Kuchesfehani’s execution was
    drawn from two electronic forms (E-forms) which were sent to Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation (ABF) and two reports by Kayhan daily on 12 March
    1980 and 13 September 2007. Mr. Kuchesfehani was born in 1924 in Rasht. He
    obtained his master’s degree in sociology from the University of Tehran
    (E-forms). The newspaper report quoted him saying that he had a law degree
    (LL.B) from the University of Tehran (Kayhan, 12 March 1980). He was a
    teacher at first, but in 1959 he was employed by the organization in
    charge of domestic security and intelligence service known as SAVAK under
    the Shah’s regime. He gained numerous honors and medals during his career
    (Kayhan, 13 September 2007). He was married with 4 children (E-forms)
    Arrest and detention Mr. Kuchesfehani was arrested around 23 February 1979
    at his home in Tehran. There is no further detail about the circumstances
    regarding his arrest and detention. According to the information sent to
    ABF, his family could not visit him during his detention (E-forms). Trial
    The Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran tried Mr. Kuchesfehani along with 10
    others. This trial took place in the first hours of the morning of 11
    March 1980 and continued until the dawn of 12 March (Kayhan, 12 March
    1980). Charges The charges brought against the defendant in the indictment
    are not know, but his collaboration with SAVAK was the core of his charges
    (Kayhan, 12 March 1980). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Kayhan reported
    that the defendants who had been interrogated by Mr. Kuchesfehani
    attributed torturous and insulting behaviors to him (Kayhan, 12 March
    1980). It is not clear in Kayhan’s report who these defendants were and if
    they were present at the court to give their testimonies. Defense No
    information is available concerning Mr. Kuchesfehani’s defense. According
    to the E-form, he was deprived from the assistance of an attorney.
    According to Kayhan , he denied torturing the detainees and said: “I have
    an LL.B from University of Tehran. In 1959 when I was searching for a job
    in the Judiciary as a judge, a person named Farhang Sa’adatmand encouraged
    me to work in SAVAK. I started working in the Judicial Section which was
    supervised by Dr. Farzin… If you want to know what happened, ask Ayatollah
    Taleqani [high ranking cleric and member of the revolutionary clerical
    elite led byAyatollah Khomeini] Considering all that happened, I do not
    have anything to say. I am confident that the judges of this court will
    consider the case fairly. So I end my defense here.” (Kayhan, 12 March
    1980) Judgment The Revolutionary Tribunal of Tehran declared Mr.
    Kuchesfehani’s verdict along with 10 others at 5 a.m. and declared them
    guilty of “corruption on earth” and sentenced them to death. This verdict
    was carried out at 6:58 a.m. by the a firing squad in Qasr Prison (Kayhan,
    12 March 1980).
