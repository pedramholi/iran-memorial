    Captain Abbas Qoli Davudi is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980
    Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have executed individuals on trumped up charges such as drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention No
    information regarding the defendant's arrest and detention is available.
    Trial Amnesty International's report on this execution contains no
    information regarding the defendant's identity or trial. Charges The
    charges against Captain Davudi, as listed in the Amnesty International
    Report, are: insulting the religious groups, insulting Muslim prisoners,
    insulting the Imam, insulting the pure clergymen and trying to discredit
    them by calling them communists; violating the right of people. N.B. - On
    8 May reports circulated in Iran and abroad that a defendant had been
    executed for "insulting the Imam". (63) On 16 May Ayatollah Azar Qomi
    denied this and said that "It is against religious law to sentence to
    death for insulting the Imam..." (64) On 26 May, Ayatollah Khomeini issued
    an edict banning anyone from insulting the clergy. The edict provided for
    trial in a revolutionary tribunal and also made provision for the trial of
    persons who "posed as clergymen for their own ends". (65) The offence of
    "insulting the Imam" is included within List A, Category 2d as the source
    of Amnesty International's information on this matter comes within the
    category of material on which these lists have been compiled." The
    validity of the charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available on the evidence presented
    against Captain Davoudi. Defense No information is available regarding the
    defense of the accused. Judgment The defendant was sentenced to death and
    executed. No other details are available.
