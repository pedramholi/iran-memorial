    The execution of Mr. Mahmud Pishbahar and another individual was reported
    by the correspondent of the Kayhan daily in Qasr e Shirin. Further
    information about this execution was sent to Omid via an electronic form
    by a person familiar with the case. Arrest and detention According to the
    form, Mr. Pishbahar did not have access to an attorney and was not allowed
    visitation with his family, while in detention. Further circumstances of
    the defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Based on the
    report, the trial was held in a Garrison called Abuzar in Sar e Pol e
    Zahab. Charges Mr. Pishbahar was charged with sodomy. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. Judgment The Religious Judge of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Pishbahar to death. He was executed
    at dawn.
