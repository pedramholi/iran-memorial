    The execution of Mr. Jalil Golandami, along with three other individuals,
    was announced by the Commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards in
    Mahabad (West Azarbaijan). The Enqelab Eslami daily published the news
    (September 29, 1979). Further information regarding Mr. Golandami’s
    arrest, trial and execution was sent to Omid via an electronic form by a
    relative. Other information about this case has been gathered by the
    Boroumand Foundation from the book Sahifeh-ye Emam by Ayatollah Khomeini,
    volume 9, the book Ayam-e Enzava (Times of Solitude) by Ayatollah
    Khalkhali, the report “The Demise of Sadeq Khalkhali” by Mansur Boluri
    (Iranian Political Bulletin, 30 November 2003), as well as the report
    Murder at Mykonos published by the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center.
    Mr. Golandami, resident of Mahabad, worked as a registrar for the Kordish
    Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI). At the time, the city was mostly occupied
    by peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). He enjoyed reading and writing,
    and a story written by him has remained after his execution. Mr.
    Golandami’s execution was part of a wave of executions that took place in
    order to combat the “anti-Revolutionary” elements in Kordestan region.
    Following the negotiations between the PDKI and the interim prime
    minister, several clashes occurred, at times armed, between the
    Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga particularly in the cities of
    Sanandaj (Kordestan province) and Paveh (Kermanshah province). These
    intensifying conflicts between the new central Shiite government of Iran
    and the mainly Sunni region of Kordestan concerned the role of minorities
    in the drafting of the constitution, specification of Shiite as the
    official state religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region.
    Subsequent to conflicts that resulted in some casualties, on August 18,
    1979, Ayatollah Khomeini issued an order to the military and the armed
    forces to “move to Paveh and end the fighting…” In the same order, he
    encouraged them to use force and threatened that: “if they do not move
    toward Paveh within 24 hours with missiles and tanks and all necessary
    arsenals, I will hold them accountable. And in case of any infringement of
    this order, I will treat them in a Revolutionary manner” ( Sahifeh-ye Emam
    , p. 285). On August 19, Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the “party of
    Satan” and declared it “unofficial and illegal” noting that some of these
    “anti-Islamic” individuals had boycotted the referendum of April 1, when
    people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime ( ibid p.
    311). In accordance with Khomeini’s order, Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali
    traveled the western region of Iran and told a reporter from the Ettela’at
    newspaper: “I will visit all areas of Kordestan… and will bring to justice
    anybody who was involved in these bloody plots” ( Times of Solitude p.
    96). According to Mr. Boluri, Ayatollah Khalkhali condemned at least 58
    Kords to death in the span of 10 days. Mass executions and conflicts
    continued for many months in that region. Arrest and detention Based on
    the information present on the electronic form, Mr. Golandami was arrested
    by the Revolutionary Guards in the area of Bagh-e Siseh, in Mahabad. He
    was arrest on September 27, 1979 at 5 p.m. along with other youths and
    taken to a youth center. He was arrested without a warrant. Enqelab Eslami
    wrote: “The head of the Revolutionary Guards of Mahabad stated that,
    several individuals have been arrested [regarding the recent events:]
    certain counter-revolutionary elements have attacked the Revolutionary
    Guards brothers in various parts of the city, and have wounded and killed
    them; some of these elements have been killed as well.” Mr. Golamdami
    spent less than 24 hours in detention before his execution. He was not
    given access to an attorney. After interrogation, Mr. Golandami was
    severely tortured (electronic form). Trial According to the form, Mr.
    Golandami had no formal trial, rather a short interrogation by Sadeq
    Khalkhali served as his trial. Mr. Golandami was informed of his charges
    at this interrogation. Khalkhali asked him, “after the execution, where do
    you want to be buried?” Mr. Golandami replied it did not matter, since he
    would be dead. The newspaper report indicates that the defendants’ trial
    started immediately after their arrest. Mr. Golandami was tried along with
    three other individuals, and the verdict was issued the immediately.
    Charges Based on the information available in the form, Khalkhali accused
    the defendant of “being a corruptor on earth, cooperating with the
    Kordestan Democratic Party of Iran, owning firearms, and attacking
    revolutionary guards with grenades.” The newspaper report specifies that
    Mr. Golandami and 2 other defendants were charged with being
    “counter-revolutionary.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
