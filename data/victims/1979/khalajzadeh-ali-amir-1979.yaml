    News of the execution of Mr. Ali (Amir) Khalajzadeh was published in the
    Kayhan newspaper on July 4, 1979. Mr. Ali Khalajzadeh, an "agent of the
    former regime," is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980, Amnesty
    International report. The report lists defendants who were convicted by
    Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from the Tribunals inception until
    August 12, 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from sources
    including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried out by
    local and foreign media, and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. Mr. Khalajzadeh owned a garage named Ariamehr toward the
    outskirts of Tehran. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information
    on Mr. Khalajzadeh s arrest and detention. Trial Branch One of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tehran began the trial session of Mr. Khalajzadeh
    on July 3, 1979, in the afternoon. This trial ended in the evening of the
    same day. Charges According to the Kayhan newspapers, quoting the
    Revolutionary Public Prosecutor s indictment, the charges against Mr.
    Khalajzadeh were announced as: 1. Adultery with two married women; 2.
    Aborting a one-month-old baby, based on a doctor s report; 3. Adultery
    with several [unmarried] women, based on existing evidence; 4. The wall of
    his garage fell on two workers during the Shah s regime, causing their
    deaths and dismissing the case by using his influence at the time; 5.
    Possession of an identification card issued by the Second Base Army; 6.
    Organizing hooligans in favor of the hated Pahlavi regime and suppressing
    freedom lovers; 7. Organizing girls and women to participate in the Aban
    4thcelebration [on the birthday of the previous regime s crown prince];
    and 8. Harassing people, due to his dependence on the sinister regime of
    Pahlavi. Mr. Khalajzadeh was also charged for naming his garage and for
    his relationships with his employees. According to the Kayhan newspaper, .
    . . he was very influential and named his garage Ariamehr [a common
    reference to the Shah at the time] to have a free hand to harass people.
    For this, nobody dared to challenge him. When he employed his workers, he
    would take checks and promissory notes in order to fire them at will as he
    used to do. According to the Amnesty International report, the charges
    against Mr. Khalajzadeh, were: corruption on earth; war on God; torture
    (physical); participation in the regime's official ceremonies; mobilizing
    "stick-wielding ruffians; "participating in threats and terrorism against
    just people; forcing others to use narcotics and alcohol; and supporting
    the previous regime. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, along with sexual and other
    criminal offenses. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. E vidence of Guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Khalajzadeh. Among the charges brought against him,
    there is an indication regarding existing evidence. However, there is no
    further explanation. Also, the naming of his garage, Ariamehr, was
    considered as evidence. According to the Kayhan report, judges
    investigated the charges against Mr. Khalajzadeh and heard his defense;
    however, there was no reference to any testimony against him. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Khalajzadeh's defense. It is not clear
    whether due process of law -- such as the right to access an attorney or
    to call a witness -- had been observed. Judgment Branch One of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tehran identified Mr. Khalajzadeh as Mofsed
    [corruptor on earth] and guilty of all charges indicated in the indictment
    of July 13, 1979, at 9:30 p.m. The court condemned him to 100 lashes and
    death. According to the newspaper report, the ruling was carried out one
    hour later, and he was executed by firing squad.
