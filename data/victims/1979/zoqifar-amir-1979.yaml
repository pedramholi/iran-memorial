    The execution of Mr. Amir Zoqifar and another individual was reported in
    the Kayhan newspaper quoting a communiqué of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Yazd (August 6, 1979). Amnesty Inetrnational’s report of March
    13, 1980 lists this victim, without mentioning his name, among 438 persons
    who were convicted and executed by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period
    from their inception until August 12, 1979. The list of victims and
    charges is drawn from sources including translations of indictments,
    reports of trials carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins
    of the official Pars News Agency reports. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the trial. Charges The defendant was
    charged with being an accomplice in misguiding and eventually raping a
    villager woman who had missed her bus and was lost in the city. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report mentioned that the witnesses’
    testimonies and the defendant’s clear confession regarding the sexual
    assault were heard. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on the defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Yazd declared Mr. Zoqifar “a corruptor and an
    anti-revolutionary” for rape and “violating people’s honor.” He was
    sentenced to death, and executed by firing squad at 2:30 a.m. on August 6,
    1979 in Yazd.
