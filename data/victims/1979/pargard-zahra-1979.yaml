circumstances: >
    The execution of Ms. Zahra Pargard was announced in a communiqué of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz. The correspondent of the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily in Ahvaz reported the news (November 19, 1979). The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges Ms. Pargard was charged with "establishing a
    brothel", "luring and corrupting girls", and "drawing an income through
    this illegitimate activity." Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The residing religious judge at the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Ahvaz declared Ms. Pargard a "corruptor on earth" and
    sentenced her to 100 lashes, execution, and confiscation of part of her
    property. The sentence was carried out on Friday morning.
