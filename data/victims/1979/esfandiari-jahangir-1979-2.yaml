    Information about Brigadier General Jahangir Esfandiari has been taken
    from three electronic forms sent to Omid by individuals familiar with this
    case. His execution was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on April 14,
    1979. He is also one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty
    International report. The report lists defendants who were convicted by
    Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception until 12 August
    1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from sources including
    translations of indictments, reports of trials carried out by local and
    foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News Agency reports.
    According to an electronic form, Mr. Esfandiari was a graduate of the
    Maritime University and the Brigadier General of Division 92 of Khuzestan.
    He was not affiliated with any political party or organization. Arrest and
    detention Brigadier General Esfandiari was arrested in his work place in
    Ahvaz (Khuzestan province) on February 12, 1979; the arrest warrant was
    not shown to him. First, he was detained at his work-place at Division 92
    military base of in Ahvaz. He was, then, transferred to Abadan, Tehran,
    Khoramshahr, and back to Abadan. During this time, he was tortured, and
    had a broken rib and hand. His wife visited him in Abadan and Qasr prison
    in Tehran. Other than these visits, his family was generally unaware of
    his whereabouts. Brigadier General Esfandiari was denied the right to be
    represented by an attorney. Trial Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Abadan
    (Khuzestan province) held a session at 8 p.m. on April 13, 1979 in order
    to review the case of Brigadier General Esfandiari and two other
    individuals, and after a few hours of deliberation, the court issued its
    verdict at the same session ( Kayhan ). A witness, however, has denied
    this, stating that the verdict was issued immediately, without the proper
    proceedings (electronic form). The session was held without the presence
    of a defense attorney. Charges Brigadier General Esfandiari was charged
    with mass murder of the people of Abadan, and negligence of the army s
    announcement of solidarity with the people ( Kayhan ). International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have executed individuals on trumped up
    charges such as drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution mentioned that a large
    audience and many witnesses were present at the court session ( Kayhan ).
    No other information is available about the evidence and witnesses
    testimony. Defense The details of Brigadier General Esfandiari s defense
    are not know; he was tried without an attorney. He reportedly presented 20
    pages of his defense to the court, but the court did not examine it
    (electronic form). Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Abadan
    called Brigadier General Jahangir Esfandiari a corruptor on earth and
    condemned him to death ( Kayhan ). According to available information, on
    April 14, 1979, people of Abadan went to the location where he was to be
    executed and prevented his execution. Mr. Esfandiari was then taken to the
    deserts of Khoramshahr and shot (electronic form).
