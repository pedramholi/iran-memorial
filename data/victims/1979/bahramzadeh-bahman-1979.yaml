    Mr. Bahman Bahramzadeh, son of Qoli, is one of 438 victims listed in a
    March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. Additional information is
    taken from an e-form sent to Boroumand Center by a person close to Mr.
    Bahramzadeh. The UN report lists defendants who were convicted by
    Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception until 12 August
    1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from sources including
    translations of indictments, reports of trials carried out by local and
    foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News Agency reports.
    The execution of Mr. Bahramzadeh, along with two other individuals, was
    also announced by the Kayhan newspaper on March 6, 1979, and the Ayandegan
    newspaper on March 7. Mr. Bahramzadeh was 16 and single. International
    laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment for those who were under
    the age of 18 at the time of committing a crime. As a party to the
    International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on
    the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation not to impose capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and
    detention The details of this defendant s arrest and detention are not
    known. According to the Kayhan report, he and his two co-defendants were
    arrested a few days prior to their trial and execution. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial other than he was tried
    at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz. Charges According to the
    Ayandegan newspaper, Mr. Bahramzadeh and the other two individuals were
    charged with sodomy with a 16 year old boy named Ebrahim. In accordance
    with the ruling of the religious court, Ebrahim was condemned to 100
    lashes and the verdict was carried out. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on his defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz condemned Mr. Bahman
    Bahramzadeh to death. He was executed by a firing squad, along with his
    two co-defendants, at the Darolrahma cemetery in Shiraz.
