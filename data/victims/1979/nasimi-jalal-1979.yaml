    website). Background of the Marivan Events, Spring and Summer 1979 On
    Saturday, July 14, 1979, protest demonstrations took place in the town of
    Marivan. These demonstrations resulted in fighting among the people,
    various political groups, members of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, and
    certain armed Kurdish groups based in the region; the outcome was 26 dead
    and 60 injured. Some reports have stated the reason for the demonstrations
    as being popular objection to the news broadcast by the State Radio and
    Television from the Kurdistan region. Other reports have attributed these
    demonstrations to the Marivan Farmers Union s (2) objection to the
    tensions created by some of the region s landowners under the guise of
    Islamic Revolution Komiteh (neighborhood militias). Still others have
    reported the objections of a group of people to the activities of the
    Koran School (3) or individuals affiliated with it, led by Mr. Ahmad
    Moftizadeh. There are also conflicting and different accounts of the cause
    of fighting and of the political groups involved in the incidents.
    According to some reports, some armed groups among the protestors
    instigated members of the region s Islamic Revolution Komiteh, which
    resulted in bloody skirmishes. Other reports have declared members of the
    Revolutionary Guards Corps and certain Kurdich activists including members
    of the School of Islam and Qiadeh Movaghat ( Temporary Leadership ) (4)
    led by Messrs. Massud and Idris Barzani as the ones firing, as a result of
    which armed individuals among the protesters took reciprocal action. In
    addition to the Revolutionary Guards forces, Mr. Moftizadeh s forces, and
    Mr Barzani s forces, members of Komala, Kurdistan Democratic Party members
    (5) and persons affiliated with Mr. Jalal Talebani (6) were also present
    at these skirmishes, and later, in the city. According to certain sources,
    the protests in the city of Marivan had begun in June 1979, following
    skirmishes between major landowners and other group active in the region.
    (Ettela at newspaper, Hekmatist website). Negotiations between local
    forces and representatives of the central government who had come to the
    region to resolve the disputes failed. In order to prevent further
    conflict and bloodshed, and in protesting the presence of the
    Revolutionary Guards forces in Marivan, some Kurdish political activists
    in Marivan encouraged the residents to vacate the city. On July 20, 1979,
    assisted by active political forces, the city s residents left town and
    went to the woods outside the city and settled at the Kanimiran camp.
    Political negotiations to return the residents back into the city bore no
    fruit until August 13, 1979. On that day, and at the same time Kurdish
    forces opposed to the central government were fighting the Armed Forces in
    the city of Paveh, the people of Marivan returned to the city. (Iran Human
