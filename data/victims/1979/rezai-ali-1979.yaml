    Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Ali Reza i was
    published in several sources, including Ettela at Newspaper (December 6
    and 8, 1979) and Kayhan Newspaper (December 6 and 11, 1979). Additional
    information regarding his death was collected from Kayhan Newspaper
    (December 8 and 18, 1979), Ettela at Newspaper (December 9, 1979 and April
    5, 1980), and research done by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center. Mr. Reza
    i was 27. He was from the town of AzarShahr in Azarbaijan Sharqi Province
    (Ettela at Newspaper December 6, 1979). (Kayhan Newspaper December 18,
    1979). The Muslim People's Republic Party The Muslim People's Republic
    Party (MPRP), more commonly known as the Moslem People s Party, was
    founded in March 1979 with the blessing and support of the influential
    Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari. The aim of the MPRP s
    founding members, which included Ayatollah Shariatmadari s son, Hassan,
    was to bring together more enlightened Muslim forces and work towards an
    ideal progressive society. Its guiding principles were written with an eye
    to ensuring the guidance of Islam in all aspects of life, the immutable
    role of citizens voices in shaping and running their own government, and
    the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic on the global stage. (1) The party
    was based in Tabriz and had a strong and diverse following in Western and
    Eastern Azerbaijan, as well as in cities such as Qom, Tehran, Ardebil and
    Mashhad. (2) The MPRP called on its members to vote yes in the March 1979
    Referendum to establish an Islamic Republic, but criticized the absence of
    the rule of law and abuses of power by some of Ayatollah Khomeini s
    supporters. Chief among the galvanizing forces for the party of
    Shariatmadari s followers was opposition to the concept of velayat-e faqih
    (guardianship of the theologian), which, if written into the constitution,
    would place ultimate executive power in the hands of the Supreme Leader.
    Though some of the party s founding members would resign after its
    decision to boycott the August 1979 election of the Assembly of
    Constitutional Experts a cleric-contingent governing body supplanting the
    anticipated, more representative constitutive assembly the MPRP movement
    maintained the solidarity and numbers necessary to make heard their
    demands of increased local autonomy in Azerbaijan, popular sovereignty,
    and corresponding revisions to the constitution. In December of 1979, the
    party boycotted the referendum on the draft constitution, and continued
    after the referendum to advocate for changes to key constitutional
    articles. Starting in December of 1979 and for close to six weeks,
    demonstrations in support of the MPIRP and Ayatollah Shariatmadari clashed
    with Ayatollah Khomeini s followers and the provisional government, as the
    latter moved swiftly to quash the former s influence across Iran. Due to
    its history of embattled minority rights, Azerbaijan was a particular
    hotspot for escalating conflicts over constitutional representation.
    Ayatollah Shariatmadari had strong support among armed forces there, and
    MPRP was demanding that he vet the nominations of local officials.
    Nonetheless, the MPIRP s influence was far from localized, and Ayatollah
    Khomeini s cohort would aggressively suppress it. A convergence of
    pro-Shariatmadari demonstrators and pro-Khomeini counter protesters
    outside Ayatollah Shariatmadari s house in Qom on December 5 ended in the
    shooting death of one of Shariatmadari s guards; systematic censorship of
    Ayatollah Shariatmadari s statements in the media led to MPRP takeovers of
    government buildings and the National Broadcasting station in Tabriz
    December 6 - 11, amid clashes that killed and wounded several people.
    Widespread unrest continued as Ayatollah Khomeini and the Revolutionary
    Council continued to ignore MPRP demands. By January of 1980, government
    forces had managed to crush the swell of the MPRP, killing at least 20 and
    injuring hundreds in the process The party was banned and scores of its
    members executed, imprisoned, or forced into exile.(3) Background of
    Extrajudicial Killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic
    Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated violence in
    Iran and around the world. Ever since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic
    Republic operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in
    kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose
    activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of
    extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders
    began in February 1979, and have continued during the existence of the
    Islamic Republic both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center has identified over 540 murders outside Iran attributed to the
    Islamic Republic of Iran. (4) Opponents of the Islamic Republic have been
    assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic in various ways outside
    Iran, in countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, India,
