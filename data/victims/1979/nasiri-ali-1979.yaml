    Mr. Ali Nasiri's execution was announced along with 5 others in a
    communique issued by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Iran and
    published by the Ayandegan daily, on March 8, 1979. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges Mr. Nasiri was charged with "acts incompatible with chastity,
    regarding minors." He was accused of being part of a group of corrupted
    people who "earned a living by forcing youngsters into prostitution and
    indecent acts." Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Nasiri's defense. Judgment Mr.
    Nasiri was convicted and sentenced to death. No further information is
    available.
