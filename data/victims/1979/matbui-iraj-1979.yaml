    The execution of Mr. Iraj Matbu i was announced in the Kayhan newspaper of
    September 24, 1979. Mr. Matbu i, a senator under the previous regime, was
    tried along with two other senators, Mr. Mohsen Khajenuri and Mr. Jamshid
    A lam. The reports of their trials were published in Kayhan from September
    19 to September 24, 1979. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Mr. Matbu i was
    tried along with the other two senators in four sessions of the Central
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal. Trials were held at the Central
    Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office located in Evin Prison. Charges
    According to the Kayhan report, the representative of the prosecutor
    presented the indictment as follows: Retired Major General Iraj Matbu i is
    accused of participation in the 1920 coup d tat that brought Reza Shah to
    power, mobilization of armed forces and issuing the order for the
    Goharshah Mosque massacre in Mashhad in 1935, confiscation of land that
    belonged to farmers, membership in the Senate and striving to stabilize
    the anti-people government of the now dethroned Shah, and public acts of
    indecency. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the newspaper, the evidence
    against Mr. Matnu i included: his confessions and the medal that he
    received for his participation in the coup d tat, admitting that as the
    Commander of the Brigade he had sent a battalion to the Goharshah Mosque,
    which resulted in 25 deaths and 40 injuries, widespread complaints by the
    residents of Mashad, complaints and testimonies of some farmers regarding
    the confiscation of their lands, which the accused registered under his
    own children s names. We ask that all the funds be extracted from his bank
    accounts and those of his children, and that he be punished as an Enemy of
    God. Defense After the indictment was presented, the presiding judge asked
    the accused, Iraj Matbu i, to defend himself. He started his defense by
    saying: I have 62 years of honest service behind me. I have never used the
    tribune of the parliament for words of flattery, and if things were said
    at the parliament with which I did not agree, I would be sure to get up
    and leave. About the 1920 coup d tat, I have to say that I was an Infantry
    Captain at the time and they moved our regiment from Qazvin to Tehran
    without any prior consultation with me. We arrived in Tehran on the
    morning of February 22nd with no trouble. Later they told us that the move
    had been part of a coup d tat. I was resting in my office when I heard
    gunshots and artillery fire. Later I heard that they had targeted the
    Police Department. This is all there is to my participation in the coup.
    About the Goharshah Mosque, the story was this: Someone by the name of
    Bohlul had arrived in Mashad by way of Tabas and Gonabad [all in Khorasan
    province] and was standing in the courtyard of Imam Reza Shrine, enticing
    people against the use of Pahlavi hats [similar to the French kepi, made
    official by Reza Shah to replace the traditional headgear for men].
    Fathollah Pakravan, father of Major General Hassan Pakravan, was the
    Governor of Khorasan and he had ordered Colonel Bayat, the Chief of
    Police, to arrest the guy. As the Chief of Police went to the Shrine to
    make the arrest, somebody by the name of Asadi, who was the Vice
    Administrator of the Shrine, asked him not to interfere with the matter
    and assured him that he would take care of it personally. He, then, locked
    this person in one of rooms around the Shrine courtyard. The same evening,
    he was let out due to pressure from the people. I was entirely unaware of
    what had been going on regarding Bohlul s arrest. I was at home when they
    informed me that the Governor and the Chief of Police had come to see me.
    They asked for my opinion as the Commander of the Division and requested
    that I send some infantry to the Shrine to take the revolt under control.
    I told them the matter could be taken care of quite smoothly by gently
    advising the religious authorities to advise the people against revolting.
    But they insisted that I send forces down to the Shrine. There were around
    800 people sitting in at the Shrine by then. The Governor, the Chief of
    Police, and I each reported the matter to Tehran independently. The
    Governor told me that during his term as the Ambassador of Iran in Russia,
    they used to suppress similar revolts immediately through military force.
    Still, I did not bend to his will and told him that this was not Russia
    and that I could not agree with his suggestion. Then I received a response
    to my telegraph from the Shah s office in Tehran. The response was
    extremely harsh and insulting. I am too ashamed to even repeat here some
    of the derogatory words that were used against me. They ordered me to
    immediately send some infantry for the Governor. I sent him about 250
    soldiers but emphasized t
