    Dr. Gholam Reza Kianpour is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980
    Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. Additional information has been sent to Omid via an
    electronic form. Arrest and detention No information regarding the
    defendant's arrest and detention is available. Trial Amnesty
    International's report on this execution contains no information regarding
    the defendant's identity or trial. Charges The charges against Mr.
    Kianpur, as listed in the Amnesty International report are, corruption on
    earth; war on God and God's prophet, and the deputy Imam Zaman (absentee
    Imam); insulting religious groups, insulting the pure clergymen and trying
    to discredit them by calling them communists; plunder of national
    treasury; slander and injury to people; exercising censorship; expanding
    the influence of imperialists; torture; mass murder. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have executed individuals on trumped up
    charges such as drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available on the evidence presented
    against Dr. Kianpour. Defense No information is available regarding the
    defense of the accused. Judgment The defendant was sentenced to death and
    executed. No other details are available.
