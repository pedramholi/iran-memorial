    The execution of Major General Gholam Hossein Shams Tabrizi was announced
    in the Kayhan and Ayandegan newspapers (June 2 3, 1979 respectively). He
    is one of the 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International
    report. The report lists defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary
    Tribunals in the period from their inception until 12 August 1979. The
    list of victims and charges is drawn from sources including translations
    of indictments, reports of trials carried out by local and foreign media
    and the bulletins of the official Pars News Agency reports. Major General
    Shams Tabrizi was the former head of Division 92 of the army of Khuzestan
    province, and the military commander of Ahvaz. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Shams Tabrizi’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial There is no information regarding this trial other than the
    defendant was tried at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz in the
    afternoon of June 1, 1979. Charges Kayhan reported the collective charges
    brought against Major General Shams Tabrizi and seven other persons as
    follows: “oppression and investigation of the innocent, ordering to shoot
    at the people of Ahvaz leading to their injury and death, aggressive
    repression of demonstrations of people of Khuzestan province who demanded
    their rights, infringement of their freedom and violation of their basic,
    natural, and religious rights.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning the defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz called Major General Shams Tabrizi and 7
    other persons “at war with God, his Prophet, the Twelfth Emam, and the
    Muslim nation” and condemned them to death. Major General Gholam Hossein
    Shams Tabrizi and 6 other men were shot by firing squad at 5:45 a.m. on
    June 2, 1979 in Ahvaz.
