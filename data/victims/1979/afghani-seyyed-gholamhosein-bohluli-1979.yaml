    The information regarding Mr. Gholamhossein Bohluli’s (also known as
    Afqani) execution along with 6 others was drawn from Kayhan Daily on 22
    December 1979. According to Kayhan, Mr. Bohluli committed homosexual rape
    before his trial in 1979 and was sentenced to three years of imprisonment
    with peonage but the plaintiff dropped the charges against him. He was
    subsequently released. But after some time, he was sentenced by a criminal
    court to life imprisonment for an unknown reason but he escaped during a
    riot in prison in the course of the revolution. After that he was jailed
    again for “sodomy”. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Bohluli’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Mashhad tired Mr. Bohluli. Charges Kayhan Daily reported Mr.
    Bohluli’s charges as “sodomy and distributing drugs involving heroin
    inside and outside prison”. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    concerning the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense There is
    no information about Mr. Bohluli’s defense and it is not clear if he had
    the opportunity to defend himself effectively, for example whether he had
    access to a lawyer or the possibility to summon witnesses in his favor,
    etc. Regardless of the legitimacy of the criminalization of a person’s
    sexual orientation, the validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Judgment The Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Mashhad sentenced Mr. Bohluli to death. This verdict was carried out at
    dawn on 21 December 1979.
