    The execution of Mr. Karim Bayrami was reported in the Kayhan daily of
    August 27, 1979. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Based on the
    report, the examination and deliberation around the cases of this
    defendant and two others lasted 5 days. Charges Mr. Bayrami, referred to
    in the report as "one of the elements of the former regime," was accused
    of murder. No information about the identity of the murdered individual or
    the reason and manner of murder is available. Evidence of guilt Besides
    "his firm confession," no information is available about the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    the defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the Center
    (Tehran) sentenced Mr. Bayrami to death. The Islamic Republic was thereby
    made responsible to provide a living for his dependents after his death.
