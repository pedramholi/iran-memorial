    Information about Mr. Hossein Shirani has been drawn from an interview
    with a relative, the book Sahifeh-ye Emam by Ayatollah Khomeini, volume 9,
    the book Ayam-e Enzava (Times of Solitude) by Ayatollah Khalkhali, the
    Kayhan newspaper dated 19 and 23 Aug. 1979 (in which his name was mistyped
    as Shabani), the report The Demise of Sadeq Khalkhali by Mansur Boluri
    (Iranian Political Bulletin, 30 November 2003), the report Murder at
    Mykonos published by the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center. Mr.
    Shirani was a graduate of the agricultural vocational school of Kermanshah
    and was a teacher. He was affiliated with the Kordish Democratic Party of
    Iran. Mr. Shirani s execution was part of a wave of executions that took
    place in order to combat the anti-Revolutionary elements in Kordestan
    region. Following the negotiations between the PDKI and the interim prime
    minister, several clashes occurred, at times armed, between the
    Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI)
    particularly in the cities of Sanandaj (Kordestan province) and Paveh
    (Kermanshah province). These intensifying conflicts between the new
    central Shiite government of Iran and the mainly Sunni region of Kordestan
    concerned the role of minorities in the drafting of the constitution,
    specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and particularly
    the autonomy of the region. Subsequent to conflicts that resulted in some
    casualties, on August 18, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini issued an order to the
    military and the armed forces to move to Paveh and end the fighting In the
    same order, he encouraged them to use force and threatened that: if they
    do not move toward Paveh within 24 hours with missiles and tanks and all
    necessary arsenals, I will hold them accountable. And in case of any
    infringement of this order, I will treat them in a Revolutionary manner (
    Sahifeh-ye Emam , p. 285). On August 19, Ayatollah Khomeini called the
    PDKI the party of Satan and declared it unofficial and illegal noting that
    some of these anti-Islamic individuals had boycotted the referendum of
    April 1, when people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic
    regime ( ibid p. 311). In accordance with Khomeini s order, Ayatollah
    Sadeq Khalkhali traveled the western region of Iran and told a reporter
    from the Ettela at newspaper: I will visit all areas of Kordestan and will
    bring to justice anybody who was involved in these bloody plots ( Times of
    Solitude p. 96). According to Mr. Boluri, Ayatollah Khalkhali condemned at
    least 58 Kords to death in the span of 10 days. Mass executions and
    conflicts continued for many months in that region. The Kordish Democratic
    Party of Iran (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with the objective to gain
    autonomy for Kordestan, in north-west of Iran. After the Revolution,
    conflicts between the new central Shiite government and the mainly Sunni
    Kordestan, regarding the role of minorities in the drafting of the
    constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and
    particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in armed clashes between
    the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The
    PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, when people went to polls to
    vote for or against the Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979 Ayatollah
    Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan and declared it unofficial and
    illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke out and continued for several
    months in the region. By 1983, PDKI had lost much of its influence in the
    region. Various leaders of the PDKI have been assassinated. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Shirani was one of the activists of a sit-in in an area
    known as Qal eh Quri (on the road between Kermanshah city and Paveh). Due
    to his epilepsy, he left Qal eh Quri a few days prior to the end of the
    sit-in. He was identified and arrested as he rode on a minibus to
    Kermanshah and was detained in Dizelabad prison of Kermanshah. The date of
    the arrest was August 14 or 15, 1979. During his detention, Mr. Shirani
    was held incommunicado. In an interview that was published on August 23,
    the religious judge in Kermanshah denied the rumors that prisoners were
    tortured and prohibited the families from visiting the prisoners: I
    request the families to look after their children and watch for any
    anti-Revolutionary behavior or activity. [I also ask them] not to follow
    up with the cases of their children and let the Revolutionary Tribunals
    carry out their functions ( Kayhan August 23, 1979). According to the
    interviewee, nearly a thousand of residents of Paveh had gathered in Qal
    eh Quri in protest to state violence against Kords and endangering their
    lives. This sit-in, which lasted for almost two weeks, ended on August 18,
    1979, when state authorities attacked Paveh and armed struggles broke out
    in the city. Trial Mr. Shirani s trial took place in Dizelabad prison. The
    religious judge in Kermanshah denied the rumors of execution of leftists
    without trial ( Kayhan August 23, 1979).
