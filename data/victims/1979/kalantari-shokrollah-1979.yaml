    was executed while he was serving four years of imprisonment sentence.
    Information about the execution of Mr. Shokrollah Kalantari, son of Ali,
    along with another person* was published in Keyhan Newspaper on October
    11, 1979. Additional information in this regard was obtained through
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interviews with an informed person December
    3, 2017 and March 30, 2018 (ABC interview), an ABC interview with a
    resident of Najaf Abad, a report published in the Etela at Newspaper, a
    report by a group of lawyers** (Lawyer s Report), ABC s research, and
    documents available at ABC. Mr. Kalantari was born in 1940 in the city of
    Dehagh in Esfahan Province. He was married and had children. His army rank
    was Sergeant Major and before the Islamic Revolution he was the Head of
    the Gendarmerie of Tiran County in Esfahan province. Before the Islamic
    Revolution, Mr. Kalantari was the Head of the Gendarmerie of Tiran County
    in Esfahan province and his army rank was Sergeant Major. Background A
    majority of the citizens of Najaf Abad were opposed to the Pahlavi
    government. Some of the influential leaders of the revolution were from
    this city. In December 1978 (Muharram 1399), in the chaos preceding the
    revolution, events detailed below occurred in the city of Najaf Abad,
    which, after several months and with the victory of the Islamic
    Revolution, lead to the arrest of Mr. Dadkhah Tirani along with the head
    of the Gendarmerie in Tiran. These individuals were then charged with
    involvement in these incidents (ABC interview). According to the news
    published on the events of the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th of Muharram,
    1399 (December 11, 12, 13 and 14, 1978), a report by a group of lawyers on
    this matter and ABC interviews, it is inferred that the events in Najaf
    Abad can be separated into three episodes: 1) Muharram 10th, 1399
    (December 11, 1978): According to available information, a group of young
    people in Najaf Abad pulled down the statue of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi
    in the main square of the city on this day (ABC interview). 2) Muharram
    11th and 12th, 1399 (December 12 and 13, 1978): After the statue of the
    Shah was pulled down, a group of officers including municipal police and
    SAVAK (Organization of National Intelligence and Security) agents from the
    city of Najaf Abad along with a number of residents of the city of
    Yazdanshahr (a city near Najaf Abad with a mostly Lur population) in a
    punitive operation, identified the revolutionaries in the city, attacked
    their houses and stores, burned some of their houses and stores as well as
    the city s bazaar, broke many stores windows and plundered them, and
    assaulted many people in Najaf Abad and killed some of them (ABC interview
    and Lawyers Report). 3) Muharram 13th, 1399 (December 14, 1978): A large
    number of people from villages and towns near Najaf Abad (including Tiran
    County) were persuaded and organized by government officers to stage a
    stret protest in favor of the government in Esfahan. One of the residents
    of Tiran, who was a witness to the event, estimates that several thousand
    people in a long line of cars drove towards Esfahan. They carried pictures
    of the Shah and the flag of Iran and shouted Long Live the Shah . Military
    vehicles, at the beginning and end of the line, escorted and directed the
    cars. The caravan entered the city of Najaf Abad, passing toward Esfahan
    without any conflict. On the way out of the city of Najaf Abad, a number
    of tanks and military vehicles blocked the road, preventing the cars from
    going forward and forcing them to return. The eyewitness added that as the
    caravan was heading back, some Najaf Abad residents attacked the cars by
    throwing stones and Molotov cocktails, which the military responded to by
    shooting (ABC interview). The information obtained from the informants and
    residents of Tiran and Najaf Abad about these incidents in Najaf Abad
    during the above-mentioned dates and the extent of the involvement of the
    residents of Tiran in these events is conflicting. According to a resident
    of Najaf Abad, on Muharram 13th (December 14) an intense clash occurred
    between Tiran and Najaf Abad residents and many residents of Tiran were
    injured by Najaf Abad residents and, according to this eyewitness, a
    number of injured people from Tiran escaped and took refuge in the
    eyewitness father s home. However, an interviewee from Tiran, who was an
    eyewitness during the incident, denied those claims and stated that no one
    from Tiran was injured or killed on Muharram 13th (December 14( (ABC
    interview). The Islamic Revolutionary Court in Esfahan tried Mr. Kalantari
    and the other defendant in the case in one session. Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of Mr. Kalantari s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court in Esfahan tried Mr. Kalantari in
    one session on June 26, 1979. At the trail session, which started at 6:00
    PM and lasted until 8:00 PM, Mr. Kalantari was tried simultaneously with
    the other defenda
