    The execution of Mr. Mansur Shafi’i and three others was announced in the
    Kayhan (December 8 9, 1979) and the Jomhuri Eslami newspapers (December 8,
    1979). Arrest and detention The details of Mr. Shafi’i’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Mr. Shafi’i was tried at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Kazerun. Charges According to Kayhan , Mr.
    Shafi’i was charged with murder. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Shafi’i’s defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kazerun condemned Mr. Shafi’i to death
    and the Prosecutor of Shiraz approved the sentence. Mr. Mansur Shafi’i was
    executed by firing squad in Shiraz.
