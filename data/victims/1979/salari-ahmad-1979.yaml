    The execution of Colonel Ahmad Salari was reported in the Enqelab Eslami
    and Kayhan dailies of September 11, 1979. Further information regarding
    the method and place of execution was drawn from an electronic form sent
    to Omid by a person familiar with this case who has asked to remain
    anonymous. Arrest and detention The only information available regarding
    this defendant s arrest and detention is that he was held at the Evin
    Prison. Trial Based on the Enqelab Eslami report, the court held 6
    sessions to discuss the cases of this defendant and 6 others. It entered
    deliberation on Thursday, September 6. Charges The Kayhan report listed
    the defendant s charges as follows: Participation in the arrest and
    interrogation, along with torture, of a large number of Mojahedin and
    combatants, including Navab Safavi, Khalil Tahmasbi, and other members of
    the Islamic Fedayeen group, while in charge of military commandership in
    the shameful post-coup years of 1953-1956 Obtaining confessions from the
    opponents of the detested Pahlavi regime through beastly tortures [ ]
    Participation and direct involvement in the torture of one of the
    combatants named Dr. Mohammadreza Monzavi, resulting in his death in
    1955/56 [...] Participation in creating suppression, and therefore
    strengthening the foundations of the Idolatrous Regime, through 18 years
    of service at the SAVAK [Shah s political police] between the years of
    1957 and 1975. Evidence of guilt The Kayhan report referred to the
    documents available in the file , defendant s own confessions , complaints
    , and witnesses testimonies in this regard. In the Kayhan daily of
    September 6, 1979, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Tabriz said of the general conditions of complaints and testimonies in the
    Revolutionary Tribunals: We have different types of witnesses or
    complainants: First are those whom we know are to be trusted because of
    their background, second are those who take oath, and finally there are
    those who actually present well-documented evidence. It is not clear
    whether or not in this case any well-documented evidence was presented
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense.
    Judgment The First Branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of the
    Center (Tehran) declared Col. Salari a clear example of a corruptor on
    earth and sentenced him to death. The execution was carried out at Evin
    Prison.
