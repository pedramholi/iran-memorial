    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Kamali and two other individuals was reported
    by the correspondent of the Kayhan newspaper in Chalus (September 11,
    1979) and the correspondent of Pars News Agency in Sari ( Enqelab Eslami
    newspaper, September 12, 1979). Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Based on the
    Pars report, the trial of this defendant and two others took place in
    several sessions. Charges Ms. Kamali was charged with “establishing
    corruption centers and distributing narcotic drugs” (Pars News Agency).
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on the defense. Judgment Based on the Kayhan
    report, the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shahsavar (renamed Tonekabon
    in Mazandaran province) declared Mr. Kamali a “corruptor on earth” and an
    “enemy of God and his people” and sentenced him to death. He was executed
    by firing squad at 1 a.m. on September 10, 1979.
