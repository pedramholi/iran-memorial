    The information regarding Major Abdolhossein Sorush’s execution along with
    one other was drawn from Kayhan Daily on 4 June 1979. Major Sorush was the
    Head of Rafsanjan Police Station, a city in Kerman Province in
    southeastern Iran. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Major
    Sorush’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Rafsanjan tried Major Sorush along with 13 others. According
    to Kayhan, this trial was held “in the presence of hundreds of audiences
    and reporters of mass media, radio and television” and lasted for two
    sessions. Charges Kayhan Daily reported Major Sorush’s charges as
    “ordering to shoot and murder three warriors named Hossein Ansari,
    Mirafzali, and Akbar Moqimi”. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against Major Sorush. Defense
    No information is available concerning Major Sorush’s defense and it is
    not clear if he had the opportunity to defend himself effectively, for
    example whether he had access to a lawyer or the possibility to summon
    witnesses in his favor, etc. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Judgment The Revolutionary Tribunal of
    Rafsanjan sentenced Major Sorush along with one other to death. The
    verdict was carried out at 5:00 a.m. on 4 June 1979.
