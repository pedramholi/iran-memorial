    He favored greater independence for regional and local office holders,
    spoke the languages of the places he d lived, tended his rose bushes, and
    served 14 years as prime minister. Mr. Amir Abbas Hoveyda, former prime
    minister of Iran, is one of 438 victims appearing in an Amnesty
    International report dated March 13, 1980, which lists defendants
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals between the Tribunals inception and
    August 12, 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    translations of indictments, local and foreign media reports on trials
    carried out, and the bulletins of the official Pars News Agency. Mr.
    Hoveyda s trial and execution were announced in the Kayhan newspaper
    (February 13, March 15, and April 8, 1979) and on Islamic Republic
    state-run television (April 17, 1979). News of the execution was
    immediately published widely in newspapers outside Iran. Additional
    information below is drawn from the website of the Iran newspaper (April
    9, 2003); Mr. Abbas Milani s book The Persian Sphinx , the website Mr.
    Hoveyda s brother, Mr. Fereidun Hoveyda, dedicated to his case, Le Monde ,
    April 12, 1979, as well as The New York Times , May 7, 1979. Amir Abbas
    Hoveyda was born on February 18, 1919, in Tehran, where he received his
    primary education. According to information posted to his brother s
    website, Mr. Hoveyda continued his education in Beirut, later earning a
    master s degree in political science and economics from the Universit
    Libre in Brussels and a Ph.D in history from the Sorbonne, in Paris. Upon
    returning to Iran, Mr. Hoveyda started his career at the Ministry of
    Foreign Affairs (1942). Before becoming prime minister, he worked at the
    Iranian embassies in France and West Germany (1945-47 and 1947-51,
    respectively), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva
    (1952-56), the Iranian Embassy in Ankara (1957), the Iranian National Oil
    Company (1958-64), and the Ministry of Finance (1964). When the New Iran
    Party was formed on December 15, 1963, Mr. Hoveyda became its deputy
    secretary-general. He later replaced the secretary-general, Mr. Hassan Ali
    Mansur, after Mansur was assassinated on January 21, 1965 (F. Hoveyda s
    website). Mr. Hoveyda was prime minister from January 27, 1965, to August
    7, 1977. During this time he advocated tax law reform, stabilization of
    prices, and more power for provincial and local authorities. Under his
    administration, Iran joined the Central Treaty Organization and held
    negotiations with the Soviet Union on the construction of a steel mill and
    a natural gas pipeline, as well as exploiting iron and coal mines (F.
    Hoveyda s website). In 1975, the multi-party system was replaced by a
    single party, the Rastakhiz Party, and Mr. Hoveyda became head of the
    Party. After his dismissal as prime minister on August 7, 1977, he became
    Minister of the Royal Court, a post from which he was dismissed on
    September 9, 1978. On a personal level, Mr. Hoveyda had previously been
    married for five years and had no children. He was hard-working and loved
    reading. He spoke English, French, German, and Arabic fluently. He loved
    playing golf and tennis, and gardening roses (F. Hoveyda s website).
    Arrest and detention On November 8, 1978, the Shah ordered Mr. Hoveyda s
    arrest. Following the fall of the monarchy on February 11, 1979, Mr.
    Hoveyda s captors fled. He turned himself in to the new authorities and
    was detained for about two months. In a press conference on February 13,
    1979, Mr. Hoveyda said: I have been detained in accordance with Article 5
    of the Martial Law, and I am here today. I was alone at the detention
    center today. There was no guard to stop me [had I decided to escape]. But
    I have decided to surrender myself, and that is why I have come here [the
    headquarters of the provisional government]. I had the chance to get in a
    car and leave. If I wanted to flee, I could have done so six months ago,
    but I stayed. If there are any charges, I will address them. In response
    to the journalists aggressive questions, he stated: This is a press
    conference, not a trial. The report in Kayhan noted that Mr. Hoveyda had
    lost 20 kg of weight. He told the reporters that during the past 25 days,
    he had had no access to radio or newspapers and was unaware of the
    happenings in the outside world. According to Milani s book, Mr. Hoveyda
    seemed doubtful about the due process of law in the new Islamic regime. In
    a note in French that Mr. Hoveyda smuggled out of the prison on March 1,
    1979, through his doctor and a cousin, he wrote: There will be no
    attorney; they hate us and think we destroyed all that was dear to them;
    they will kill us all; conditions are worse than you can imagine. Death
    will be a blessing. Trial The first session of Mr. Hoveyda s trial took
    place at the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal, at forty-five minutes past
    midnight on March 15, 1979 ( Kayhan ). The authorities had not informed
    him of the date and time of the trial, and according to Kayhan , When
