    interviews with people informed about this matter, the electronic report

    Bahman, 23 and 26 Esfand 1357, Islam Times site, 27 Dey 1394 and Dana New
    Agency site, 26 Aban 1392. Brigadier General Akbar Ghaffarian Omid, son of

    on 4 Khordad 1304. He was a graduate of the Military Academy and had
    reached the level of Brigadier General in the Imperial Army. He was the
    Commander of the Armed Battalion 2 of the city of Dezful. His resume
    included having served as a support for the Commander of the Armed Brigade
    2 for the city of Ahvaz and having served in the Armored Center of the
    city of Shiraz. An acquaintance of his is quoted as having characterized
    Brigadier General as altruistic, athletic, kind, family man, selfless, and
    authoritative. He was interested in riding, swimming, and tennis. Whenever
    he was transferred to a new garrison, he would build stables and riding
    arenas. He not only encouraged his own family, but he also encouraged the
    family members of other military personnel to be active and participate in
    sports (per Boroumand Foundation interview with a knowledgeable
    individual). Brigadier General Ghaffarian Omid s file is a part of the
    wave of executions that took place in the cities of Dezful and Andimeshk
    during the first months following the success of the 57 (1978) revolution
    and the events of the 27 Dey of 1357. Background The day after the
    departure of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi from Iran, on 26 Dey 1357, several
    skirmishes took place between some army officials and the revolutionaries
    in some cities, including Dezful. There are conflicting reports about
    these events and the number of people killed. According to the information
    available, Brigadier General Ghaffarian Omid, the Commander of the Armed
    Brigade 2 of Dezful, ordered the removal of the statues of the Shah to
    prevent gatherings of the crowd (Islam Times, 27 Dey 1394, and Keyhan, 28
    Dey 1357). In the afternoon of the following Wednesday, the Police
    Department declared that it is no longer responsible for the safety and
    security of the city. This announcement lead to the decision by some young
    revolutionaries to subdivide the city into several areas for maintaining
    local security (Islam Times. 27 Dey 1394). The news of events in Ahvaz,
    including the presence of the army, along with some civilians armed with
    tanks, guns, and machine guns in the city, as well as the news of pillage
    and setting some businesses on fire, along with killing of people, reached
    Dezful. Using the loud speakers in the mosques, it was broadcasted that
    Dezful should probably brace itself for similar events and the citizens
    need to be on alert (Islam Times, 27 Dey 1394). Several skirmishes started
    in the afternoon of the same day. The Public Relations Department of the
    Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a statement announcing some protestors
    gathered around the barracks and caused disturbances with throwing stones
    and chanting slogans . Some of the protestors attacked the wife of a
    senior military personnel and disrespecting her, tore her clothes to
    pieces. This violent act enraged the young military personnel. They left
    the barracks and started fighting the crowd, resulting in the death of six
    and injury to 20 people (Pars News Agency 27 Dey 1357). According to
    another report, Some people from Dezful told the representative of Ettela
    at newspaper that no one had gathered around the barracks and there were
    no slogans against the soldiers (Ettela at, 1 Bahman 1357); whereas some
    military personnel in the military s Dodge cars, attacked shops in Dezful
    streets. They were carrying large bats and were breaking shop windows
    (Ayandegan, 30 Dey 1357). According to another report, military tanks and
    personnel carriers attacked the people of Dezful on 27 Dey. This report
    further asserts that there was a con
