circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Reza Talebi, a minibus driver, was reported by the
    correspondent of the Enqelab Eslami daily in Esfahan (September 2, 1979).
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial Based on the report, the trial of Mr.
    Talebi ended in the afternoon of August 29, 1979. Charges The defendant
    was charged with "directing the stick-wielding hooligans during the
    Muharram [holy Shiite month] 11 and 12, 1978 demonstrations in Najafabad."
    He was also accused of "extra-marital sexual relations and moral
    corruption." Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on the defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Najafabad sentenced Mr. Talebi to death. The
    sentence was carried out at dawn, 4 days after its issuance.
