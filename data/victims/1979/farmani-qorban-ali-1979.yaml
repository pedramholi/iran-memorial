    Information about Mr. Qorban Ali Farmani has been taken from an electronic
    form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. According to
    this form, he was a police officer in Kashan (Esfehan province). Arrest
    and detention According to available information, Mr. Farmani was arrested
    in his house at 2 a.m. of a February night in 1979. He had visits with his
    wife during his detention, and gave her his ring during a visit. Trial
    There is no information regarding this trial other than he was tried at
    the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Kashan. Charges Mr. Farmani was
    charged with “affiliation with the previous regime and the murder of
    Revolutionary people.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    refers to a 17 or 18 year old person who came to the court on a wheelchair
    and claimed that the defendant had caused his disability when the latter
    had shot him. Whether this claim was true or not is not known. Defense No
    information is available concerning the defense; he was denied the right
    to be represented by an attorney. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal condemned Mr. Qorban Ali Farmani to death. He was shot by a
    firing squad in the cellar of the courthouse in 1979.
