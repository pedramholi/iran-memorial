    The information about Mr. Habib Cheraghi has been drawn from an electronic
    form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case, the book
    Sahifeh-ye Emam by Ayatollah Khomeini, volume 9, the book Ayam-e Enzava
    (Times of Solitude) by Ayatollah Khalkhali, the report “The Demise of
    Sadeq Khalkhali” by Mansur Boluri (Iranian Political Bulletin, 30 November
    2003), the report Murder at Mykonos published by the Iran Human Rights
    Documentation Center, as well as the Kayhan newspaper (Aug. 21 23, 1979).
    The sender of the electronic form, states that Mr. Cheraghi was a
    peshmerga , who according to Kayhan was affiliated with the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan. The sender of the form remembers Mr. Cheraghi
    as an honest man, who was a good model for others to live by. Mr. Cheraghi
    was a husband and a father of three. Mr. Cheraghi’s execution was part of
    a wave of executions that took place in order to combat the
    “anti-Revolutionary” elements in Kurdistan. Following the negotiations
    between the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) and the interim
    prime minister, several clashes occurred, at times armed, between the
    Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI)
    particularly in the cities of Sanandaj (Kordestan province) and Paveh
    (Kermanshah province). These intensifying conflicts between the new
    central Shiite government of Iran and the mainly Sunni region of Kordestan
    concerned the role of minorities in the drafting of the constitution,
    specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and particularly
    the autonomy of the region. Subsequent to conflicts that resulted in some
    casualties, on August 18, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini issued an order to the
    military and the armed forces to “move to Paveh and end the fighting…” In
    the same order, he encouraged them to use force and threatened that: “if
    they do not move toward Paveh within 24 hours with missiles and tanks and
    all necessary arsenals, I will hold them accountable. And in case of any
    infringement of this order, I will treat them in a Revolutionary manner” (
    Sahifeh-ye Emam , p. 285). On August 19, Ayatollah Khomeini called the
    PDKI the “party of Satan” and declared it “unofficial and illegal” noting
    that some of these “anti-Islamic” individuals had boycotted the referendum
    of April 1, when people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic
    regime ( ibid p. 311). In accordance with Khomeini’s order, Ayatollah
    Sadeq Khalkhali traveled the western region of Iran and told a reporter
    from the Ettela’at newspaper: “I will visit all areas of Kurdistan… and
    will bring to justice anybody who was involved in these bloody plots” (
    Times of Solitude p. 96). According to Mr. Boluri, Ayatollah Khalkhali
    condemned at least 58 Kurds to death in the span of 10 days. Mass
    executions and conflicts continued for many months in that region. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Cheraqi was arrested on August 11, 1979 in his house in
    Paveh without a warrant (electronic form). Whether or not he and other
    victims had visits with their families before execution is not known.
    However, according to statements of the religious judge in Kermanshah, it
    appears that authorities prohibited the families from visiting the
    prisoners: “I request the families to look after their children and watch
    for any anti-Revolutionary behavior or activity. [I also ask them] not to
    follow up with the cases of their children and let the Revolutionary
    Tribunals carry out their functions” ( Kayhan August 23, 1979). Trial
    According to Kayhan , “Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali… having visited the
    damaged parts of the city [Paveh] including a hospital, which was badly
    damaged by the attackers… examined the files of the offenders and after 14
    hours of deliberation” he condemned 9 individuals to death, including Mr.
    Cheraghi ( Kayhan August 21, 1979). Ayatollah Khalkhali calls this session
    a “Revolutionary summary trial” ( Times of Solitude p. 95). The religious
    judge of Kermanshah denied “the rumors of execution of leftists without
    trial” ( Kayhan August 23, 1979). Charges The charges brought against the
    defendant are not known. Evidence of guilt Ayatollah Khalkhali mentions in
    his memoir that: “all the executed individuals… confessed during the
    interrogation that they had participated in the armed invasion of Paveh” (
    Times of Solitude p. 96). International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available
    concerning Cheraghi’s defense. Judgment Ayatollah Khalkhali called Mr.
    Habib Cheraghi and 8 other prisoners “corrupt on earth, and at war with
    God and his prophet” and condemned them to death ( Kayhan August 21,
    1979). According to Ayatollah Khalkhali, some of the residents of Paveh
    came to him and asked him for amnesty. He repli
