    From Parliament, representing Mahabad, to the Rastakhiz Party and on to
    cabinet-level ministerial posts, Dr. Ameli Tehrani (an anesthesiologist)
    was falsly accused of participation in mass murder of people. The
    execution of Dr. Mohammad Reza Ameli Tehrani, along with 20 other
    individuals, was announced in the Kayhan newspaper on May 8, 1979. He is
    one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International
    report. The report lists defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary
    Tribunals in the period from their inception until 12 August 1979. The
    list of victims and charges is drawn from sources including translations
    of indictments, reports of trials carried out by local and foreign media
    and the bulletins of the official Pars News Agency reports. Additional
    information has been sent to Omid via an electronic form by an individual
    familiar with this case. Dr. Ameli Tehrani, an Anesthesiologist, started
    his political career as an elected member of the Parliament to represent
    the people of Mahabad (West Azarbaijan province) in 1967. He was appointed
    as a secretary of the Rastakhiz party in 1974. In the autumn of 1977, he
    became the assistant to the secretary-general of the party and in January
    1978, he was appointed the deputy of the secretary-general of the party.
    He resigned from his position in July 1978 and started working as the
    Information and Tourism Minister in the cabinet of Sharif Emami. Later, he
    was appointed the Education Minister in the military government of Azhari
    (Nov. 8, 1978 Jan. 7, 1979). The Rastakhiz Party was established in 1974
    as a single party, after the abolition of such parties as Novin and
    Mardom. The regime at the time announced membership in Rastakhiz to be the
    civil duty of all citizens. The main principles of Rastakhiz were: loyalty
    to the Constitution, the Monarchy, and the goals of the White Revolution.
    The latter was a series of reforms, launched by Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi
    (1919-1980) in order to improve the economic and social situation in the
    country. Land reforms and women s suffrage were at the center of the White
    Revolution. Among other reforms of the White Revolution were combating
    illiteracy and the formation of Army of Knowledge and Army of Health,
    which added a component of civil service in remote areas to the compulsory
    military service. Arrest and detention No information regarding the
    defendant's arrest and detention is available. Trial The Kayhan report
    contains no information regarding the defendant s trial other than he was
    tried at Branch 3 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran, although
    the newspaper printed the charges against and defense of Mr. Ameli
    Tehrani. Charges The indictment has not been published. The newspaper
    story does not specify the personal charges against Mr. Ameli Tehrani; it
    only mentioned the collective charges brought up against him and 20 other
    individual: being at war with God and God propher, and insulting the Emam,
    torture and cruelty towards the public, participation in mass murder of
    people . According to Amnesty International, Mr. Ameli Tehrani was chared
    with: corruption on earth; war on God, God s prophet and the
    representative of the Twelfth Imam; torture; mass murder; insulting the
    religious groups, insulting Muslim prisoners, insulting the pure clergymen
    and trying to discredit them by calling them communists; slander and
    injury against people. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have executed individuals on trumped up charges such as drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    No information is available on the evidence presented against Mr. Ameli
    Tehrani however the Judge s arguments and Mr. Ameli Tehrani s defense
    suggest that his ministry at the Azhari cabinet was used an evidence
    against him. Defense The judge, having pointed out to the curfew and
    murders perpetrated my army officials, in which Mr. Ameli Tehrani was
    allegedly involved, asked him to defend himself. Mr. Ameli Tehrani
    replied: the curfew applies when non-military forces are not sufficient. I
    was not responsible for the curfew. I was in a state committee that
    started its work after the curfew bill was passed. I was against it and I
    expressed my opposition to the state committee and asserted that people
    must not be target of shootings. He also added that the mobilization of
    armed forced in one area was beyond his power and that he had no authority
    with regards to the curfew. Concerning the break-out of fire, the details
    of which were not mentioned in the newspaper story, he asserted: It was
    people who set [buildings] on fire. But SAVAK agents were definitely
    involved as well In order to investigate the cas
