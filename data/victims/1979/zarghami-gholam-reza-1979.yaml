    The execution of Mr. Gholam Reza Zarghami was announced by the spokesman
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Public Prosecution Office of Khuzastan in
    Ahvaz, quoted by the Pars News Agency ( Enqelab Eslami, Jomhuri Eslami,
    and Kayhan newspapers, September 30, 1979). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    defendant was charged with deluding and raping boys, adultery, drinking
    alcoholic beverages, moral corruption, counter-revolutionary activities,
    hooliganism, and gambling. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The Kayhan
    report referred to the defendant s clear confession regarding the first
    three charges and other evidence in his file. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense No information is available on the defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Ahvaz declared Mr. Zarghami a corruptor
    on earth and sentenced him to death. He was executed immediately
    thereafter.
