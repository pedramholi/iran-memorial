circumstances: >
    The information regarding Mr. Esma’il Purqoli’s case was drawn from a
    report by Kayhan daily on 5 May 1979 and an electronic form (E-form) which
    was sent to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) by a person close
    to him. Mr. Purqoli was 30 years old and a bus driver. He was born into a
    religious family (ABF E-form). Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    Mr. Purqoli’s arrest and detention are not known but according to the
    E-form he was arrested in the early spring of 1979 in Orumieh–a city in
    Azarbaijan-e Gharbi in the northwest of Iran. Trial The Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Khoi in Azarbaijan-e Gharbi Province tried Mr. Purqoli along
    with 4 others (Kayhan). Charges According to Kayhan’s report, Mr.
    Purqoli’s was charged with: “ordering the murder of the martyr-warrior,
    Majid Mohamadzadeh; shooting, arson, robbery, and sedition”. The report
    specifies that Mr. Purqoli was a bus driver and “an element of the former
    regime” but provides no information about how and in what position Mr.
    Purqoli participated in the alleged crimes. Evidence of guilt No
    information is available concerning the evidence presented against Mr.
    Purqoli. Defense According to the E-form, Mr. Purqoli was pardoned by the
    Supreme Leader but there is no further detail about his defense. It is not
    clear if he had the opportunity to defend himself. Furthermore, the
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of basic guarantees of a fair trial. Judgment
    The Islamic Tribunal of Khoi declared Mr. Purqoli and 3 others guilty of
    “corruption on earth” and sentenced them to death. This verdict was
    carried out at dawn on 5 May 1979 by the firing squads in Khoi (Kayhan).
