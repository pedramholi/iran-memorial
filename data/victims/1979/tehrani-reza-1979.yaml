    Mr. Reza Tehrani, son of Abdollah, is one of 438 victims listed in a March
    13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who
    were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their
    inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn
    from sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials
    carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official
    Pars News Agency reports. The execution of Mr. Tehrani, along with two
    other individuals, was also announced by the Kayhan newspaper on March 6,
    1979, and the Ayandegan newspaper on March 7. Arrest and detention The
    details of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. According
    to the Kayhan report, he and his two co-defendants were arrested a few
    days prior to their trial and execution. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant’s trial other than he was tried at the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz. Charges According to the Ayandegan
    newspaper, Mr. Tehrani and the other two individuals were charged with
    “sodomy with a 16 year old boy named Ebrahim.” “In accordance with the
    ruling of the religious court, Ebrahim was condemned to 100 lashes” and
    the verdict was carried out. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on his defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz condemned Mr. Reza
    Tehrani to death. He was executed by a firing squad, along with his two
    co-defendants, at the Darolrahma cemetery in Shiraz.
