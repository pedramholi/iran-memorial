    Information about the execution of Brigadier General Mozaffar Niazmand has
    been gathered by the Boroumand Foundation from the report “The Demise of
    Sadeq Khalkhali” by Mansur Boluri (Iranian Political Bulletin, 30 November
    2003), an electronic form sent to Omid an an individual familiar with this
    case, and the book Ayam-e Enzava (Times of Solitude) by Ayatollah
    Khalkhali. Additional information has been drawn from the book Sahifeh-ye
    Emam by Ayatollah Khomeini, volume 9, the report Murder at Mykonos
    published by the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center, as well as the
    article “A Chilling Photograph’s Hidden History” by Joshua Prager,
    published in The Wall Street Journal on December 02, 2006. This article
    tells the story of the photograph of this execution by Mr. Jahangir Razmi.
    Mr. Niazmand was the former head of the police department of Sanandaj
    province (electronic form and Times of Solitude p. 99). Mr. Niazmand’s
    execution was part of a wave of executions that took place in order to
    combat the “anti-Revolutionary” elements in Kurdistan. Following the
    negotiations between the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) and
    the interim prime minister, several clashes occurred, at times armed,
    between the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of the
    PDKI) particularly in the cities of Sanandaj (Kordestan province) and
    Paveh (Kermanshah province). These intensifying conflicts between the new
    central Shiite government of Iran and the mainly Sunni Kurdistan region
    concerned the role of minorities in the drafting of the constitution,
    specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and particularly
    the autonomy of the region. Subsequent to conflicts that resulted in some
    casualties, on August 18, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini issued an order to the
    military and the armed forces to “move to Paveh and end the fighting…” In
    the same order, he encouraged them to use force and threatened that: “if
    they do not move toward Paveh within 24 hours with missiles and tanks and
    all necessary arsenals, I will hold them accountable. And in case of any
    infringement of this order, I will treat them in a Revolutionary manner” (
    Sahifeh-ye Emam , p. 285). On August 19, Ayatollah Khomeini called the
    PDKI the “party of Satan” and declared it “unofficial and illegal” noting
    that some of these “anti-Islamic” individuals had boycotted the referendum
    of April 1, when people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic
    regime ( ibid p. 311). In accordance with Khomeini’s order, Ayatollah
    Sadeq Khalkhali traveled the western region of Iran and told a reporter
    from the Ettela’at newspaper: “I will visit all areas of Kurdistan… and
    will bring to justice anybody who was involved in these bloody plots” (
    Times of Solitude p. 96). According to Mr. Boluri, Ayatollah Khalkhali
    condemned at least 58 Kurds to death in the span of 10 days. Mass
    executions and conflicts continued for many months in that region. The
    photograph of this execution was published in the Ettela’at (August 28,
    1979). However, the newspaper did not reportedly publish the picture in
    the version sent to Kordestan province (Mr. Prager’s article). This
    photograph was also sent to and published by international press, such as
    The News York Times , The Washington Post , and The Daily Telegraph of
    London. The same day as the publication of Ettela’at , the religious judge
    claimed that it was not an authentic picture. On September 9, the Islamic
    Revolutionary Council, in a communiqué published in Enqelab-e Eslami
    newspaper, referred to this picture and stated: “If this occurs again,
    serious decisions will be made.” Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    Mr. Niazmand’s arrest and detention are not known other than he was
    arrested in Orumieh after the Revolution and at the time of Sanandaj
    conflicts he was in prison. Trial According to Mr. Prager, “10 handcuffed
    men filled a wooden bench before the judge, a black-bearded Shiite cleric
    named Sadegh Khalkhali. An injured 11th prisoner lay on a stretcher beside
    the door. The judge removed his turban… removed his shoes. He put his feet
    on a chair. Scanning the prisoners through thick eyeglasses, he asked
    their names. Officers of the court told of the defendants’ alleged
    crimes.” The trial lasted for about half an hour. Charges Ettela’at
    reported the charges against Mr. Niazmand as “repression of the
    freedom-loving population of Sanandaj during battles for the liberation of
    the Iranian nation (before the Revolution)” (Aug. 28, 1979). The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt According to Mr. Prager, quoting the journalist of the
    news story, “[n]o evidence was presented… It was pure speculation.”
    According to the same source, one of the defendants was a “sandwich maker,
    [who] belonged to no political party but possessed a handgun.” It appears
    that the gun was used as evidence to prove the “murde
