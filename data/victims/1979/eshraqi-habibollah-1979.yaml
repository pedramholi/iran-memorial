    The execution of Mr. Habibollah Eshraqi was reported by the Kayhan
    correspondent in Esfahan (October 4, 1979). Arrest and detention The
    report specified that Mr. Eshraqi had been released on bail after having
    been detained and kept in prison for a long while but that he had been
    re-arrested after that. Trial Mr. Eshraqi’s case was examined at the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Esfahan, presided by the religious
    judge. Charges Mr. Eshraqi, “former director of Shir va Khorshid e Sorkh
    [Red Lion and Sun, Iranian Red Cross under the Shah], former head of the
    Art and Culture Bureau and head of the School of Midwifery who had been
    directing the Shir va Khorshid and other institutions for 29 years,” was
    charged with the following: “Embezzlement of millions of Tomans from
    Muslims’ treasury, providing means for debauchery for himself and those
    associated with the regime and the detested Pahlavi family, inciting to
    corruption and prostitution many young girls and boys and forcing them to
    act in an inhuman way, and persisting in strengthening the hated Pahlavi
    Regime.” Evidence of guilt The report of this execution only referred to
    the “witnesses’ testimonies and complaints” as the evidence of guilt
    presented against the defendant. Defense It was said that Mr. Eshraqi’s
    defense was heard, but the nature and circumstances of the defense remain
    unknown. Judgment Following the reading of the indictment, and after
    hearing the complaints and the defense, the Tribunal deliberated and
    declared Mr. Eshraqi guilty of “corruption on earth” and “waging war
    against God.” He was condemned to execution and confiscation of property.
    The death sentence was carried out immediately.
