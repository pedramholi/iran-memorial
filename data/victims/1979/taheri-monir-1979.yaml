    Captain Taheri s family, in Rasht, insisted he had never been to Abadan.
    The Cinema Rex case, however, demanded a final resolution and verdicts.
    Captain Monir Taheri is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13, 1980
    Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media; and the bulletins of the official Pars
    News Agency reports. The execution was also reported in Kayhan as well as
    by the Ayandegan daily (February 24, 1979), which published a letter by
    the family of Captain Taheri on February 25. The letter questioned the
    validity of the charges against him, as reported by Seda va Sima (the
    Iranian Radio and Television), and called on the authorities to
    investigate his execution and clear his name. The Cinema Rex arson,
    referred to below, during which an estimated 377 people burned alive, took
    place on August 19, 1978 in the city of Abadan. At the time, the
    authorities attributed the arson to anti-regime religious activists, while
    the opposition blamed the political police, SAVAK, for setting the Cinema
    on fire to discredit the Islamist militants. During the year following the
    February 1979 Revolution, the Cinema Rex case became a source of tension
    in Abadan between authorities and victims families. The latter accused the
    revolutionary authorities of hampering the investigation, protecting those
    responsible, and covering up the truth. The authorities invoked the
    successive resignations of those in charge of investigating the case to
    justify the delay in bringing those responsible to justice. In August
    1980, a religious judge was sent to Abadan to hold a trial, following an
    active campaign, including a 4 month sit-in by some victims families in a
    public office (April to August 1980), in favor of a serious investigation
    by a special prosecutor and a public trial. The sit-in was forcefully
    disbanded by the revolutionary guards before the start of the trial.
    Twenty-six people, including the only survivor of the four-man team that
    set the movie theater on fire, were put on trial from August 25 to
    September 4, 1980. The trial lasted 17 sessions, following which Hossein
    Takb'alizadeh , the arsonist, and 5 other individuals were executed in
    public. Excerpts of statements by the prosecutor, the religious judge,
    witnesses, and a number of defendants were published in the press (See
    Kayhan and Jomhuri Eslami, August 26 to September 5, 1980). Arrest and
    detention Based on the Kayhan report, the defendant was arrested in the
    town of Mianeh (East Azarbaijan province) two days prior to his trial by
    the Revolutionary Committee, which transferred him to Rudsar (Gilan
    province) and called on the prosecutor s office to investigate him. Trial
    Captain Taheri was tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal of Rudsar. The
    trial took place some time during the 48 hours following his arrest. No
    other details are available. Charges Based on the available information
    from the press, the defendant had been accused of "martyring 3 people in
    Rudsar"; "receiving guerrilla training in the United States"; "involvement
    in Abadan's Rex Cinema fire"; "receiving a Medal of Honor"; and
    "involvement in the torture of political prisoners in Mashhad and Shiraz."
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    Based on the Kayhan report, the defendant denied having been involved in
    Abadan s Rex Cinema fire and stressed the fact that he was in Ahvaz at the
    time. He also insisted that there were witnesses willing to testify in his
    favor. Regarding his actions as a police officer in Rudsar, he reportedly
    admitted guilt but noted that he was getting orders from the head of
    Rudsar Police. The day after Captain Taheri s execution, his family
    asserted his innocence in an open letter published in the press and called
    on his fellow officers to come forward and testify. The letter refuted the
    charge related to the Cinema Rex fire, noting that Captain Taheri had
    never been in Abadan and that there are documents proving that, at that
    time, he was on vacation elsewhere. The Medal of Honor, it insisted, was
    given to him prior to the Rex Cinema fire. The letter also refuted the
    allegation regarding the defendant's guerrlla training in the U.S. and
    referred to the fact that he had never traveled outside Iran. His life, it
    noted, after finishing high school in Mashhad is documented day-by-day, as
    follows: Military college in Tehran (3 years); Police Academy training (6
    months training as traffic police); and service in Mashhad, Ahvaz, Semnan,
    and Rudsar. Further, the letter rejected the validity of the accusation of
    torture in Shiraz and Mashhad. It pointed to the fact that the defendant
    had never served in, nor been to, Shiraz and h
