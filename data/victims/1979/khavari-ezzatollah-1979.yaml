    Lt. Colonel Ezzatollah Kharari is one of 438 victims listed in a March 13,
    1980 Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have executed individuals on trumped up charges such as drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention No
    information regarding the defendant's arrest and detention is available.
    Trial Amnesty International's report on this execution contains no
    information regarding the defendant's identity or trial. Charges The
    charges against Lt. Colonel Kharari, according to the Amnesty report,
    were: corruption on earth; war on God; massacre during demonstrations,
    causing death to unnamed persons during demonstrations, killing freedom
    fighters, killing Muslims; collaboration with the ousted regime and trying
    to re-establish the Shah's "idolatrous" rule over the weak and defenceless
    people; ordering troops to fire, sending in troops; armed attack,
    attacking people's homes, attacking demonstrators, shooting at people,
    direct interference to crush campaigners leading to murder and injury,
    firing on demonstration, injuring demonstrators; suppressing
    demonstrators, suppressing national and religious demonstrations,
    punishing demonstrators. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    on the evidence presented against Lt. Colonel Kharari. Defense No
    information is available on the defence. Judgment The defendant was
    sentenced to death and executed. No further information is available.
