    The General was an attentive parent, a helicopter pilot, and an
    accomplished horseman. It s said he never capitalized on his stature
    within the armed forces. Major General Manuchehr Khosrodad is one of 438
    victims listed in a March 13, 1980 Amnesty International report. The
    report lists defendants who were convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in
    the period from their inception until 12 August 1979. The list of victims
    and charges is drawn from sources including translations of indictments,
    reports of trials carried out by local and foreign media and the bulletins
    of the official Pars News Agency reports. The execution of Major General
    Manuchehr Khosrodad and three other former regime officials was also
    reported in the Ayandegan newspaper (February 16, 1979). The news was
    followed by a communiqu of the Extraordinary Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal regarding the case. Additional information has been drawn from an
    interview with Major General Khosrodad former colleagues and and
    electronic form sent to the Boroumand Foundation. Major General Khosrodad
    was the first head of the Special Forces and at the time of execution was
    Major General of the Imperial Iranian Army Aviation. He had studied at
    American Defense Academy and the French military school, Saint Cyr, and he
    mastered English and French. A helicopter pilot, Head of the Equestrian
    Federation and a champion in horseback, Khosrodad also enjoyed skiing. His
    colleague remembers him as a talented and effective manager; a loved and
    respected commander. He stresses that Major General Khosrodad was not an
    affluent man and did not abuse his position to collect wealth. He would
    move around mostly unprotected, in particular prior to the Lavizan
    incident, when four soldiers, who had joined the Islamist opposition, shot
    and killed scores of soldiers and officers during lunch time at cafeteria
    of the base. During the revolution, before the fall of the monarchy, Major
    General Khosrodad had reiterated his position on the fact that the army
    should not be involved in politics and had told his colleague: We are
    soldiers and have nothing to do with politics. I am obedient to whoever
    governs the country. Mr. Khosrodad was separated from his wife. He lived
    with his young daughter with whom he cherished. He also owned and loved a
    few German Shepherds that were killed by the Revolutionary Guards after
    the revolution. Ayatollah Khalkhali, the first post-revolution religious
    judge and head of the Islamic Revolutionary tribunal, mentions Major
    General Khosrodad and 9 others: I began to try the convicts soon after my
    nomination. The first people I tried and punished for their deeds were
    Nematollah Nasiri, head of SAVAK, and Khosrodad, air forcer commander;
    Naji, martial law administrator of Esfahan, and Rahimi, martial law
    administrator of Tehran and head of police force I believed at the time,
    and I still believe, that all the parliamentarians and senators, all
    governors, heads of SAVAK and police, who held office after 1963 and the
    Imam s boycott, should be sentenced to death. High-ranking ministry
    officials who were instrumental in the survival of the apparatus [Shah s
    regime] and who, in order to get close close to the Shah and his family,
    would accept any humiliation are all condemned . To sum up, all the people
    that I condemned and who were executed in the early days of the
    establishment of the Revolutionary Tribunals and later in the Qasr prison
    were all corruptors on earth and, based on the Quran, their blood was a
    waste. Arrest and detention Based on the official communiqu , the
    defendant was arrested by Islamic armed forces. However, the available
    information suggests that he voluntarily surrendered himself to the
    authorities. Trial The Ayandegan report mentioned that the Extraordinary
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal held a session at Alavi High School # 2
    [Refah High School], which lasted 10 hours. Based on the report, this
    Extraordinary Tribunal was ordered to form two days before it took session
    at the high school. Major General Khosrodad and the other three defendants
    were said to be the first group of officials tried after the success of
    the Revolution five days before. No other information is available on the
    court session. Charges The communiqu of the Extraordinary Revolutionary
    Tribunal did not specify Major General Khosrodad s charges. Collectively,
    the four defendants were charged with torture and massacre of the people
    as well as being traitors to the country. Evidence of guilt No information
    was provided regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense There is no information available on Major General Khosrodad s
    defense. According to the information sent to the Boroumand foundation,
    the Major General was so sure of his innocence that he voluntarily
    surrendered himself to the authorities. Judgment According to the official
    communiqu , the Extraordinary Tribunal found Major General Khosrodad
    guilty of corruption on earth and sentenced him to death
