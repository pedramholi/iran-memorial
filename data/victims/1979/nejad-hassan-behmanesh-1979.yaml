    The execution of Mr. Hassan Behmaneshnejad was reported by the Kayhan
    correspondent in Shiraz (November 11, 1979). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Based
    on this report, Mr. Behmaneshnejad was charged with raping a 6-year-old
    girl. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Behmaneshnejad's defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz sentenced Mr. Behmaneshnejad to
    death. The sentence was carried out at 11 p.m. in the shooting court of
    the Adel Abad prison in Shiraz.
