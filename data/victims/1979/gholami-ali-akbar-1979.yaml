    Amnesty International report. The report lists defendants who were
    convicted by Revolutionary Tribunals in the period from their inception
    until 12 August 1979. The list of victims and charges is drawn from
    sources including translations of indictments, reports of trials carried
    out by local and foreign media and the bulletins of the official Pars News
    Agency reports. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have executed individuals on trumped up charges such as drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention No

    report, are: mass murder; shooting at people, direct interference to crush
    campaigners leading to murder and injury, firing on demonstrators,
    injuring demonstrators. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No information is available
    on the evidence presented against Mr. Gholami. Defense No information is
    available regarding the defense of the accused. Judgment The defendant was
    sentenced to death and executed. No other details are available.
