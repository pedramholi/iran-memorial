    News of the execution of Mr. Del Aqa Barati, son of Barat, along with
    another individual, was published on the website of ISNA (Iranian Students
    News Agency) on October 15, 2002. Additional information regarding his
    arrest and prosecution was taken from the Kayhan newspaper on October 16,
    1995. Mr. Barati was an Afghan citizen. According to the Public Relations
    Office of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran, he and two others
    robbed the Adle Asgari business on April 29, 1992 at 9 p.m. The business
    guard was either shot to death by one of his collaborators or according to
    ISNA, Mr. Barati shot the guard. Arrest and Detention According to the
    existing information, police arrested Mr. Barati and he was detained since
    1995. There is no specific information on his arrest and detention. Trial
    Branch Ten of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran tried Mr. Barati.
    No information is available on his trial. Charges According to the Public
    Relations Office of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran, the charges
    against Mr. Barati were "accomplice in murder, supplying and possession of
    an illegal combat weapon and its ammunition, and creating fear and panic."
    According to ISNA, he was charged with organizing an armed group including
    several Afghans. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Barati
    was his clear confession during the investigation and having a criminal
    record. International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned
    the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Barati's defense;
    however, he objected to the court ruling. Judgment Branch Ten of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Del Aqa Barati to
    death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was executed on
    October 9, 2002. He was also condemned to 10 years imprisonment for
    possession of a weapon and creating fear and panic.
