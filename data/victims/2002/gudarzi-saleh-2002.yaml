    Sometimes Mr. Gudarzi worked as a laborer and sometimes he made his living
    by selling goods that he took from Kamyaran to Tehran. News of the
    execution of Mr. Saleh Gudarzi was published on the websites of Mihan on
    October 14, 2002, and Asre-no on October 16, 2002, quoting the statement
    by the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan. Additional information was
    taken from an interview by Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) with a
    person close to Mr. Gudarzi on January 19, 2015. Mr. Gudarzi was from the
    Ziveh Village near Kamyaran. He was married with three children. He was
    illiterate and a professional. Sometimes he worked as a laborer and
    sometimes he made his living by selling goods that he took from Kamyaran
    to Tehran. During the months before his arrest, Mr. Gudarzi and his family
    worked and resided in Tehran. He was funny, sociable, and good-humored; he
    was very sensitive regarding the Kurdistan issues. (ABF interview) Mr.
    Gudarzi was a member and sympathizer of the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan(PDKI). According to the statement issued by this party, he
    stopped working with the party due to family problems after five years and
    turned himself in to the Islamic Republic authorities in 1984 in order to
    have a normal life. This resulted in his arrest and detention for a year.
    (Mihan website) The PDKI was founded in 1945 with the objective to gain
    autonomy for Kurdistan, in north-western Iran. After the Revolution,
    conflicts between the new central Shiite government and the mainly Sunni
    Kurdistan, regarding the role of minorities in the drafting of the
    constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and
    particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in armed clashes between
    the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The
    PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, when people went to polls to
    vote for or against the Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah
    Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan and declared it unofficial and
    illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke out and continued for several
    months in the region. By 1983, PDKI had lost much of its influence in the
    region. Various leaders of the PDKI have been assassinated. Arrest and
    detention Mr. Gudarzi was arrested by Intelligence Office agents without a
    warrant in October or November of 1999 around midnight. He was transferred
    to the detention center of the Intelligence Office in Kamyaran. According
    to the interviewee, he was detained in solitary confinement at the
    Intelligence Office detention center in Kamyaran for five months and at
    the Intelligence Office detention center in Sanandaj for four months. He
    suffered physical and psychological torture throughout this period. During
    this nine month period, he had no visitations or phone calls with his
    family except once when his brother visited him at the public prison in
    Kamyaran when he was about to transfer to Sanandaj. After nine months, Mr.
    Gudarzi was able to have cabin [by phone] visitations with his family
    weekly and in person visitations monthly when he was transferred to the
    public prison in Sanandaj. (ABF interview) Trial The Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Sanandaj tried Mr. Gudarzi in four sessions without the presence
    of an attorney. His family s efforts to hire an attorney proved fruitless
    since attorneys did not accept the case due to its complications. (ABF
    interview) No further information is available on his trial. Charges
    According to the interviewee, the charges against Mr. Gudarzi were
    cooperation with the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, encouraging
    young people to act against the Islamic Republic, and armed activities.
    (ABF interview) The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Gudarzi.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Gudarzi s defense; however,
    according to the interviewee, he was denied effective defense and his
    trial sessions proceeded without an attorney. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Sanandaj condemned Mr. Saleh Gudarzi to death and
    the Appeals Court of Sanandaj confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at the
    Sanandaj public prison yard on October 13, 2002 at dawn. Authorities did
    not inform his family and they had no last visitation. A prison guard
    informed Mr. Gudarzi s brother that he had been transferred to solitary
    confinement before the ruling was carried out. When he went to the prison,
    he could only talk to his brother over the phone. (ABF interview)
    Authorities gave the body of Mr. Gudarzi to his family on the condition of
    having no mourning ceremony. His body was buried in the presence of local
    residents in the Cherusaneh Village near Kamyaran.
