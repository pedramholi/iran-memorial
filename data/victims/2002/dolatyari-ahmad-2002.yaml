    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Dolatyari was announced in the websites of the
    Jomhuri Eslami and the Iran newspapers on May 21, 2002. Additional
    information has been drawn from an electronic form sent to Omid by an
    individual familiar with this case, the Jam-e Jam newspaper (May 20,
    2002), the Iran newspaper (May 19 12, March 9, 2002; June 18, 2001) and
    the Ettela’at newspaper (Jun. 18 28, 2000; Jun. 25, Oct. 11 29, 2001).
    According to the electronic form, he worked at an automobile body shop and
    was known as Robin Hood, who took from the rich and gave to the poor. He
    had been arrested several times. Arrest and detention According to
    Ettela’at , Mr. Dolatyari was arrested in Tehran on May 18, 2000. He was
    injured in a fight in prison and transferred to a hospital, from which he
    escaped on June 13, 2000. He was re-arrested in Mashad in May or June of
    2001. Trial Mr. Dolatyari was tried at Branch 1603 of the Tehran Criminal
    Court in October 2001 ( Ettala’at ). Charges According to the newspaper
    reports, Mr. Dolatyari was charged with “murder”, which allegedly took
    place on May 2, 2000 ( Iran , March 9, 2002). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    newspapers reported that the defendant’s motive for murder was dispute
    over the ownership of stolen jewelry; the date of the alleged armed
    robbery of a jewelry store in Tehran was January 10, 2000. Defense No
    information is available concerning Mr. Dolatyari’s defense in the trial.
    According to Iran (May 21, 2002), before execution he stated: “I have not
    committed an act deserving of execution.” Judgment The Tehran Criminal
    Court condemned Mr. Ahmad Dolatyari to death and this verdict was approved
    by the Supreme Court. He was hanged in public on May 20, 2002 in Be’sat
    district in south of Tehran city.
