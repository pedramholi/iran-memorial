    News of the execution of an unknown person, along with two others, was
    published on the website of Khorasan newspaper on November 6, 2002. This
    individual was an Afghan citizen. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of the defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges
    brought against the defendant were announced as murder, armed and unarmed
    robberies, disturbing internal security, and creating fear and
    intimidation. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Qom
    condemned the defendant to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. The defendant was hanged, along with two others, in public in Qom
    in November of 2002. No specific information is available about the exact
    date and details of this execution.
