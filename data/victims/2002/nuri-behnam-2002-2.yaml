    News of the execution of Mr. Behnam Nuri, son of Ali, along with five
    others, was published in the Iran newspaper on April 27, 2002. Additional
    information was taken from various sources including the Iran newspaper on
    April 22, 24, and 25, 2002 and in the Jamejam newspaper on April 24, 2002.
    Mr. Nuri s case was related to his membership in a purse-napping gang
    called Jamileh that committed several robberies and purse-nappings in
    various cities including Shiraz, Esfahan, Tabriz, and Rasht in Iran and in
    other Persian Gulf countries between 1998 and 1999. Members of this gang
    consisted of 33 individuals and, according to the judge, 14 of them
    participated in armed robbery and extortion. Arrest and Detention
    Detectives of Branch 18 of the Intelligence Police in Tehran arrested Mr.
    Nuri, along with other members of the Jamileh gang. According to the judge
    of this case, they were arrested following some internal disputes and
    recovery of the near-dead body of an important member of the gang in a
    wilderness and his confession three years earlier in 1999. (Iran newspaper
    on April 25, 2002) The circumstances of Mr. Nuri s arrest and detention
    are not known except that he was detained at the Raja ishahr (Gohardasht)
    Prison during his last months. Trial Branch 15 of the Imam Khomeieni
    Public Court in Tehran tried Mr. Nuri in several sessions in the summer of
    2001. No further information is available on his trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Nuri were announced as "acts against internal security
    by committing 27 armed robberies with threats of murder." The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt
    According to the judge of this case, the evidence presented against Mr.
    Nuri was confessions of defendants and complaints by 200 plaintiffs. In
    addition, robbery of 65 kilograms of gold, one billion Tumans worth of
    diamonds, coins, and cash, two purchased restaurants in Thailand and the
    EUA; several houses and cars and cell phones were also considered evidence
    against the defendants. (Iran newspaper on April 25, 2002) Mr. Nuri had
    three criminal convictions. Defense According to the judicial report of
    the Iran newspaper, Mr. Nuri and four others claimed in a court session
    that even though they participated in armed operations, they did not harm
    anybody. Judgment Branch 15 of the Public Court in Tehran identified Mr.
    Behnam Nuri as fighter against God and corruptor on Earth and condemned
    him to death in September of 2001. Branch 32 of the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. Mr. Nuri was hanged in public at Azadi Square (Bus
    terminal) in Tehran on April 25, 2002 at 6:45 a.m.
