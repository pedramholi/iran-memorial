    News of the execution of Mr. Farhad Rahmanpur was published on the website
    of the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, in the Iran newspaper, and on the website
    of Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) on October 28, 2002. Additional
    information was taken from the Iran newspaper on June 8, 9, 22, and 29,
    2002, and the Jamejam newspaper on June 28, 2002. He was married with one
    child and a cook. However, he was unemployed at the time of the incident.
    His case was related to the murder of a mother and her two children at
    their house in Moniri Street in Javadieh, Tehran, on June 3, 2002. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Rahmanpur was arrested by detectives of the Homicide
    Branch of Criminal Investigators of Tehran at the Hosseinabad Village near
    Fuman on June 4, 2002. After interrogating the victims parents, police
    found a clue and realized that Mr. Rahmanpur, who lived close by, had
    travelled, along with his family, to Fuman overnight. Police arrested him
    in his relative s house at the Hosseinabad Village. They transferred him
    to Tehran with a temporary arrest warrant. (Iran newspaper, June 8, 2002)
    Trial Branch 1608 of the Criminal Court of Tehran tried Mr. Rahmanpur. He
    was tried out of turn, only 23 days after his arrest, on June 27, 2002. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against
    Mr. Rahmanpur were announced as murdering a woman and her two children,
    and robbery. According to the existing information, he went to the victims
    house and murdered his uncle s wife and her two children by blows of a
    knife. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Rahmanpur was
    recovery of five gold chains and bracelets from his home, and his
    confession. (Iran newspaper, June 8, 2002) International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Rahmanpur
    defended himself during the trial. He accepted the killing but stated that
    it all happened in a moment when he was crazy and was not aware of what he
    was doing. His motive was robbery. He also stated that he had no addiction
    and never had any. He also had no record of illness except being nervous
    (Iran newspaper, June 29, 2002). His public defender also offered some
    explanation during the trial. However, no information is available on his
    defense (Jamejam newspaper on June 28, 2002). Mr. Rahmanpur had no
    criminal record. After the forensics experts visited and studied him, they
    announced that he was not suffering from any psychological illness. In an
    interview, the judge stated that the defendant s confession regarding the
    motivation for committing the murders had not been convincing. The
    defendant reported robbery as his motive for committing the murders during
    police and judicial interrogations; however, considering the low value of
    the stolen gold, there must be another motive. It was difficult for the
    judge to accept that an individual could murder three members of his
    relatives so brutally. In the judge s view, the addiction of the defendant
    was not such that forced him to commit the murders (Iran newspaper, June
    9, 2002). Another issue was that police had found a letter at the murder
    location on the day of the incident that claimed the motive was honor
    related and a threat to destroy the house with a bomb if anyone reported
    it to the police. But police considered this mysterious letter a
    diversion. (Iran newspaper, June 8, 2002) Judgment Branch 1608 of the
    Criminal Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Farhad Rahmanpur to death, three
    counts, for committing three murders, and to three years imprisonment and
    74 lashes for robbery. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged by a crane in public and in the presence of the victims family and
    the Enforcement Officials of the Criminal Court of Tehran at the location
    of the committed crime on October 27, 2002. The victims father and husband
    tied the rope around Mr. Rahmanpur s neck and pressed the crane s button
    to pull him up. His lash ruling had also been carried out before the
    execution.
