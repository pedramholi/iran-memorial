    News of execution of an unknown person was published on IRNA on November
    05, 2002. His case was related to drug offenses. Arrest and detention
    Agents of Drug Control Headquarter s office of Tabriz arrested this person
    during a pre-arranged fake drug sale in 2000. There is no additional
    information available on the circumstances of his/ her arrest and
    detention. Trial Branch 3 of the Islamic Revolutionary court of Tabriz
    tried this person. No further detail is available on the defendant s
    trial. Charges The charge brought against the defendant is announced as
    drug possession . He was charged with possessing 2 kg of heroin at the
    time of arrest. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The evidence provided against the defendant was two kg of heroin at the
    time of arrest. Defense No information is available on the defendant s
    defense. Judgment Branch 3 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz
    sentenced this person to death. The sentence was then approved by the
    Chief Public Prosecutor and he/she was hanged in the morning of Wednesday,
    November 06, 2002 in Tabriz Prison. This person was also sentenced to
    property confiscation.
