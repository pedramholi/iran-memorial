    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Karamati was announced by the Public
    Relations Office of the Eastern Azerbaijan's Court House. The Jomhuri
    Eslami daily quoted the announcement (web edition, November 3, 2002).
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Karamati was charged with possessing and
    carrying 800 grams of heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone) of proscribed narcotics. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Karamati's defense. Judgment The Third Branch of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Tabriz sentenced Mr. Karamati to death.
    Confirmed by the country s Chief Prosecutor, the verdict was carried out.
