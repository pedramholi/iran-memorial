circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Farhad (last name unknown) was reported in the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper in Esfahan (May 29, 2002). Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information about the trial is provided. Charges The defendant
    was charged with “carrying arms illegally, blocking the roads, armed
    robbery along with creating terror among traveling passengers, and
    involvement in clashes and shooting at the officials.” The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on the defendant’s defense. Judgment Branch 8 of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal sentenced Mr. Farhad to death. The Supreme Court
    confirmed the sentence and Mr. Farhad was hanged in the evening of Monday,
    May 27, 2002 in Esfahan in the presence of the “Hezbollah Ummah”
    [community of Muslims].
