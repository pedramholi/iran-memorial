    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Saleh Moradi, known as Ali Kak
    Jalil, along with another person, was published on the websites of Rozaneh
    on November 6, 2002, quoting two newsletters by the Kurdistan Committee of
    the Workers Communist Party of Iran, and Asre-Nou on December 3, 2002. Mr.
    Moradi was from the Savoji Village in Khav and the Mirabad District of
    Marivan in Kurdistan. Arrest and detention According to newsletters of the
    Kurdistan Committee of the Workers Communist Party of Iran, Mr. Moradi was
    detained at the Marivan Prison for four months. The circumstances of his
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    Mr. Moradi s trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Moradi were
    announced as fighting with the Islamic Republic and throwing the Qoran
    into a sewer (fighting with Islam). (Rozaneh) The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Moradi. Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Moradi s defense. Judgment Mr. Mohammad Saleh Moradi was hanged
    along with another person at the security forces base in Marivan on
    November 6, 2002 at dawn. This execution was carried out in the presence
    of several clerics from Marivan and surrounding villages. The Friday Imam
    or a member of the Shahid (Martyr) Foundation placed the noose around his
    neck. (Rozaneh website)
