    News of the execution of Mr. M. R. was published in the Jomhuri-Eslami
    newspaper on September 18, 2002. He was from Iranshahr. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on Mr. M. R. s arrest and
    detention. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Abadeh tried Mr. M. R.
    No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge against Mr.
    M. R. was announced as "transporting heroin." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. M. R. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. M. R.'s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Abadeh condemned Mr. M. R. to death and the Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public at Basij Square in
    Abadeh, Fars Province on September 16, 2002.
