    News of the execution of Mr. Aziz A., along with another person, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on March 10, 2002. The case of Mr. A. was
    related to an armed robbery in 2001. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on Mr. Aziz A s arrest and detention. Trial Branch
    Three of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shiraz tried Mr. Aziz A. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges According to the Iran
    newspaper, the charges against Mr. Aziz A. were announced as "committing
    three counts of armed carjacking, four attempts of armed robbery, swapping
    stolen vehicles for narcotics, and disturbing public order." The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Aziz A. was a stolen vehicle, his getting into a fight with the owner of
    the vehicle, and injuring the owner s wife with a gunshot. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Aziz A.'s defense. Judgment Branch three
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shiraz condemned Mr. Aziz A. to
    death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in Shiraz.
    The exact date of this execution is unknown.
