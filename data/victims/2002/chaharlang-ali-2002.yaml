    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Chaharlang, son of Hossein, was published
    in the Jamejam newspaper on September 7 and in the Jomhuri-Eslami and Iran
    newspapers on September 8, 2002. His case was related to an armed robbery
    from Branch Kutabdollah of Tejarat Bank in October of 2001. Arrest and
    Detention Mr. Chaharlang was arrested by police during the identification
    of a robbery gang. There is no specific information on his arrest and
    detention. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Ahvaz tried Mr.
    Chaharlang. No information is available on his trial. Charges According to
    the Head of Public Relations Office of the Khuzestan Courthouse, the
    charges against Mr. Chaharlang were announced as Mohareb [fighting against
    God] by armed robbery, and collaboration in murder. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The evidence provided against Mr.
    Chaharlang concerned the murder of the watchman of Branch Kutabdollah of
    the Tejarat Bank, and robbery of 4.5 million Rials from the bank
    (Jomhuri-Eslami newspaper). According to the Head of Public Relations
    Office of the Khuzestan Courthouse, Based on Article 185* of the Islamic
    Penal Code, if armed robbers do not use their weapon during a robbery but
    have it in hand, they are still considered Mohareb and their punishment is
    death. (Jamejam) Defense According to reports, the bank watchman was shot
    to death not by Mr. Chaharlang, but by his casemate. No information is
    available on Mr. Chaharlang's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Ahvaz identified Mr. Ali Chaharlang as Mohareb (fighter against
    God) and condemned him to death. The judiciary confirmed the ruling. He
    was hanged in public in front of the Kutabdollah Branch of Tejarat Bank
    located on the Kutabdollah Road in Ahvaz on September 7, 2002 at 7 a.m.
    The victim s family members were present during the execution.
    ...................................... *Article 185: An armed robber or a
    bandit, who disturbs the security of the public or roads and creates fear
    and intimidation, is a Mohareb [a fighter against God].
