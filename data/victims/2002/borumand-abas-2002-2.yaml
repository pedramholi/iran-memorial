    News of the execution of Mr. Abas Borumand, son of Mohammad Hakim, along
    with another individual, was published on the website of ISNA (Iranian
    Students News Agency) on October 15, 2002. Additional information
    regarding his arrest and prosecution was taken from the Kayhan newspaper
    on October 16, 1995. Mr. Borumand was an Afghan citizen. According to the
    Public Relations Office of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran, he
    and two others robbed the Adle Asgari business on April 29, 1992 at 9 p.m.
    The business guard was shot to death by one of his collaborators. Arrest
    and Detention According to the existing information, police arrested Mr.
    Borumand and he was detained since 1995. There is no specific information
    on his arrest and detention. Trial Branch Ten of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Tehran tried Mr. Borumand. No information is available on his
    trial. Charges According to the Public Relations Office of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tehran, the charges against Mr. Borumand were
    "accomplice in murder, supplying and possession of an illegal combat
    weapon and its ammunition, and creating fear and panic." According to
    ISNA, he was charged with organizing an armed group including several
    Afghans. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Borumand was his clear confession during the investigation and having a
    criminal record. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Borumand's defense; however, he objected to the court ruling. Judgment
    Branch Ten of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Abas
    Borumand to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    executed on October 9, 2002. He was also condemned to 10 years
    imprisonment for possession of a weapon and creating fear and panic.
