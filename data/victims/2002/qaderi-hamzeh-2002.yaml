    News of the execution of Mr. Hamzeh Qaderi, son of Hossein, was published
    by various sources including the Society to Defend Human Rights in Iran on
    October 12, 2002 and the website of Asrema, quoting the Committee of
    United Action for Democracy on February 22, 2003. Additional information
    was taken from an interview by the Boroumand Foundation with a person
    close to Mr. Qaderi and a correspondence sent by the representative of the
    Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran to the European Union. According to the
    existing information, Mr. Qaderi was born in Sardasht. He was married,
    with a daughter only five months old when he was arrested. Mr. Qaderi was
    a high school graduate and an employee in the Sardasht Health Office. He
    was a member of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran. According to those
    who knew him, Mr. Qaderi had a sociable and democratic personality. He
    always helped poor people around him. He was the oldest son and the head
    of household in his father s family. The Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran
    (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with the objective to gain autonomy for
    Kurdistan, in north-west Iran. After the Revolution, conflicts between the
    new central Shiite government and mainly Sunni Kurdistan regarding the
    role of minorities in the drafting of the constitution, specification of
    Shiite as the official state religion, and particularly the autonomy of
    the region, ended in armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and
    the Peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum
    of April 1, 1979 when people went to polls to vote for or against the
    Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the
    party of Satan and declared it unofficial and illegal. Mass executions and
    fighting broke out and continued for several months. By 1983, PDKI had
    lost much of its influence in the region. Various leaders of the PDKI have
    been assassinated. Arrest and detention According to the person close to
    Mr. Qaderi, agents of the Intelligence Office in Orumieh summoned him to
    Orumieh for an official interview on October 15, 1997. They arrested him
    at the Azerbaijan-e Gharbi Health Office and transferred him to the
    Intelligence Office s prison. According to the same source, the
    interrogators inflicted psychological pressure and physical harassment
    (torture) on Mr. Qaderi during his detention period at the Intelligence
    Office s prisons in Orumieh and Sardasht. He had no visitation with his
    family during this period. Only after the trial and his transfer to the
    Orumieh Central Prison, was he allowed monthly visitations alternatively
    in a cabin for 30 minutes and in person for an hour. (Interview with ABF)
    Trial According to the existing information, the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Mahabad first tried Mr. Qaderi in the fall of 1997. It was a
    short session without the presence of an attorney. The case was subject to
    retrial and the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Orumieh retried him in the
    spring of 1998. (Interview with ABF) No specific information is available
    on Mr. Qaderi s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Qaderi were acts
    against the national security, fighting against God, and membership in the
    Kurdish Democratic Party. (Interview with ABF) The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Qaderi. However, according to the
    interviewee, his confession and several copies of the Kurdistan newspaper,
    the publication of the Kurdish Democratic Party, found in his house, were
    used against him. (Interview with ABF) International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense No information is available about Mr. Qaderi s defense.
    However, according to the interviewee, he was denied the right to an
    effective defense. Mr. Qaderi had neither access to his file, nor an
    attorney. (Interview with ABF) Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Orumieh condemned Mr. Hamzeh Qaderi to death and the Appeals Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged along with two other defendants at the
    Orumieh Central Prison on October 8, 2002. Authorities gave his body to
    the family on the condition of having no burial ceremony and only two
    family members could attend the burial. Mr. Qad
