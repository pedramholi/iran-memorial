    News of the execution of Mr. Mostafa Parsa, known as Mostafa Jula, along
    with another person, was published on the websites of Rozaneh on November
    6, 2002, quoting two newsletters by the Kurdistan Committee of the Workers
    Communist Party of Iran, and Asre-Nou on December 3, 2002. Mr. Parsa was
    from the Savoji Village in Khav and the Mirabad District of Marivan in
    Kurdistan. Arrest and detention According to newsletters of the Kurdistan
    Committee of the Workers Communist Party of Iran, Mr. Parsa was detained
    at the Marivan Prison for four months. The circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Parsa s
    trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Parsa were announced as
    fighting with the Islamic Republic and throwing the Qoran into a sewer
    (fighting with Islam). (Rozaneh) The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against Mr. Parsa. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Parsa s defense. Judgment Mr. Mostafa Parsa was hanged along with another
    person at the security forces base in Marivan on November 6, 2002 at dawn.
    This execution was carried out in the presence of several clerics from
    Marivan and the surrounding villages. The Friday Imam or a member of the
    Shahid (Martyr) Foundation placed the noose around his neck. (Rozaneh
