    News of the execution of an unknown person was published on the website of
    Khorasan newspaper on January 31, 2002. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of the defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charges
    brought against the defendant were announced as drug trafficking, murder,
    hostage taking, and sedition. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution did not provide any specific
    information on the evidence presented against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on the defendant s defense. Judgment This
    defendant was hanged in Kerman on January 30, 2002. No specific
    information is available about this execution.
