    News of the execution of Mr. Habib Seifollahi, along with two others, was

    prosecution was published in the Ettela at newspaper on February 8, 2000.
    Arrest and detention According to the Ettela at newspaper, Mr. Seifollahi
    was identified and arrested by detectives of the Intelligence Police of
    Tehran, Section 10, in Tabriz. He had escaped along with a friend to
    Tabriz after committing a crime during a collective fight at Azadi Square

    Trial The Criminal Court of Tehran tried Mr. Seifollahi. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Seifollahi
    was announced as murder. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence provided
    against Mr. Seifollahi was his confession. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Seifollahi s defense. Judgment The Criminal Court of
    Tehran condemned Mr. Habib Seifollahi to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed it. The ruling was carried out at the Qasr Prison yard when he
