    Were these two young men victims of the chain murders? News of the
    execution of Mr. Mohammad Nushinbahr, along with another person, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on May 16, 2002. Additional information
    was taken from the Ettela at and Hamshahri newspapers on May 14, 2000, the
    Ettela at newspaper on January 25, 2000, the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on
    April 20, 1999, websites of Gostaresh-Agaahi on March 17, 2013, Jonbesh
    Rahe Sabz on December 2, 2009, the Human Rights Defending Association for
    Iran on November 3, 2012, and Mihan. Mr. Kaheh s case and the case of the
    other defendant were related to the murder of a doctor and robbing him at
    his house in Jamaran, Tehran, on October 29 or 31, 1998. Both defendants
    were conscripts at the time. According to the existing information, the
    victim s body was found at his house and transferred to the forensics
    office on December 31, 1998. However, on his grave stone the date of death
    is written as December 28, 1998. According to the forensic report, marks
    on his neck indicate that the cause of death was probably suffocation with
    a rope (Human Rights Defending Association for Iran). He was a doctor for
    Ahmad Khomeini and it was said that he had information about the death of
    Khomeini s son and this was the reason for security forces in Iran to
    murder him (Mihan website). In many media reports this doctor is
    considered a victim of the infamous chain murders. The information
    regarding this case is so limited that the cause of death is not yet
    clear. Arrest and detention According to the existing information, Mr.
    Kaheh was arrested by inspectors of the Tehran and Shemiranat Police
    Departments in the fall of 1999. A seller informed the police about the
    victim s checks in the market. With the help of this seller, police agents
    were able to identify and arrest a mother and her daughter who were in
    possession of the checks. During the interrogation, the mother confessed
    that her son gave her the checks. After this confession, police agents
    identified and arrested Mr. Kaheh and his friend. He was detained over
    three years. Trial Branch 1603 of the Criminal Court of Tehran tried Mr.
    Kaheh and the other defendant in several sessions. However, no information
    is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Kaheh
    and the other defendant were announced as murder and robbery. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Kaheh was finding the
    victim s checks in Bazaar, finding the victim s belongings and stamp in
    the air conditioning canal at the house of Mr. Kaheh s mother, his
    confession, and the confession of the other defendant. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    Mr. Kaheh defended himself during his trial; however, no information is
    available on his defense. According to the forensics report, the victim
    was suffocated by a rope and there was no report of assault and battery.
    But the semi-official newspapers reported that the victim was killed by
    blows of a stick on his head (Ettela at and Jomhuri Eslami newspapers).
    The victim was a doctor for Ahmad Khomeini, son of the late Ayatollah,
    whose suspicious death is widely believed caused by the Intelligent
    Police. Therefore, the death of this doctor is also attributed to the
    Intelligent Police because he had information about the death of Ahmad
    Khomeini. Judgment Branch 1603 of the Criminal Court of Tehran condemned
    Mr. Ehsan (Ebrahim) Kaheh to death for murder, and to 10 years
    imprisonment and 74 lashes for robbery. The Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged, along with three others, at the Qasr Prison yard in
    Tehran on May 15, 2002. The other defendant of this case was also
    condemned to death. Mr. Kaheh mother was condemned to 4 years imprisonment
    and 40 lashes for possession of stolen property, forgery, and using a
    forged document. His two sisters were also condemned to one-year
    imprisonment, one of them to a suspended imprisonment.
