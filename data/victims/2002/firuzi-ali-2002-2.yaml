    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Firuzi, son of Fazlollah, was published
    in the Kayhan newspaper on April 17, 2002. Arrest and Detention The police
    officers arrested Mr. Firuzi after he was on the run for awhile. There is
    no specific information on his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Firuzi was
    tried in Qom. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge
    against Mr. Firuzi was announced as "murder." According to the report, he
    murdered an individual with a knife in 2000. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Firuzi. Defense In his defense, Mr. Firuzi
    stated that the victim intended to rape him. However, he could not
    convince the court. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Ali Firuzi to death
    and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged on April 16,
    2002 at 8:30 a.m. The ruling was about to be carried out at 7 a. m. when
    it was postponed due to an intervention seeking a pardon for him. However,
    ultimately, one of the victim s family members carried out the ruling.
