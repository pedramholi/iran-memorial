    25061 The execution of Mr. Hashem Anbarnia and another person was reported
    by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), which quoted the head of
    Police Emergencies Center (110). The Jomhuri Eslami daily published the
    report (web edition, October 28, 2002). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant's arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information about the trial is provided. Charges Ali Bayat told
    the IRNA correspondent in the Security Headquarters of the Greater Tehran
    Area that Mr. Anbarnia was charged with "martyring and shooting to death,
    on August 7, 2002, Lt. Sergeant Hosein Amiri, a security guard on duty in
    Jamshidieh Park, using a shot gun." The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Anbarnia's defense. Judgment Mr. Anbarnia was sentenced to death and the
    sentence was carried out publicly in the park, where the alleged crime had
    taken place.
