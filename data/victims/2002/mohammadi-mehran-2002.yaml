    News of the execution of Mr. Mehrab Mohammadi, also known as Mehran Reza
    i, along with another person, was published in the Jomhuri-Eslami
    newspaper on July 7, 2002, and in the Kayhan newspaper on July 4, 2002.
    Additional information was taken from two electronic forms sent to Omid by
    a person close to him. According to these forms, Mr. Mehrab Mohammadi, son
    of Reza Qoli, was born in Kazerun in 1967. He was married, a high school
    graduate, and a professional. He was a humanist and defender of human
    rights. According to the newspaper reports, Mr. Mohammadi pretended to be
    a police officer by wearing the uniform, created roadblocks, and committed
    armed robbery. Arrest and detention According to the electronic forms, Mr.
    Mohammadi was arrested in Shiraz on September 30, 2001 at 10 a.m. He was
    transferred to the Intelligence Office detention center in Esfahan where
    he was interrogated and detained. He was denied access to an attorney and
    in spite of his stomach illness, could not visit a physician. Trial Branch
    Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Esfahan tried Mr. Mohammadi in
    2001. No information is available on his trial. Charges According to the
    newspaper reports, the charges brought against Mr. Mohammadi were
    announced as addiction, armed robbery, sedition, assault and battery,
    intentional assault and battery, piracy, shooting at officers and victims,
    and using a military uniform. However, according to the electronic forms,
    his charges were Moharebeh [fighting against God] and propaganda against
    the regime. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Mohammadi. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mohammadi s defense.
    According to one electronic form, an attorney was forced not to defend
    him. Judgment Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Esfahan
    identified Mr. Mehrab Mohammadi as Mohareb [fighter] against God and the
    Prophet and Mofsed [corruptor on Earth], and condemned him to death. The
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public at the
    Darvazeh-Shiraz Square in Esfahan on July 3, 2002 in the evening. His body
    was buried in Dalorahma Cemetery in Shiraz.
