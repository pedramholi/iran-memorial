    News of the execution of Mr. Farhad Akrami, son of Ja far, along with five
    others, was published in the Iran newspaper on April 27, 2002. Additional
    information was taken from various sources including the Iran newspaper on
    April 22, 24, and 25, 2002 and in the Jamejam newspaper on April 24, 2002.
    Mr. Akrami s case was related to his membership in a purse-napping gang
    called Jamileh that committed several robberies and purse-snatching in
    various cities including Shiraz, Esfahan, Tabriz, and Rasht in Iran and in
    other Persian Gulf countries between 1998 and 1999. Members of this gang
    consisted of 33 individuals and, according to the judge, 14 of them
    participated in armed robbery and extortion. Arrest and Detention
    Detectives of Branch 18 of the Intelligence Police in Tehran arrested Mr.
    Akrami, along with other members of the Jamileh gang. According to the
    judge of this case, they were arrested following some internal disputes
    and recovery of the near-dead body of an important member of the gang in a
    wilderness and his confession three years earlier in 1999. (Iran newspaper
    on April 25, 2002) The circumstances of Mr. Akrami s arrest and detention
    are not known except that he was detained at the Raja ishahr (Gohardasht)
    Prison during his last months. Trial Branch 15 of the Imam Khomeieni
    Public Court in Tehran tried Mr. Akrami in several sessions in the summer
    of 2001. No further information is available on his trial. Charges The
    charges against Mr. Akrami were announced as "acts against internal
    security by committing 27 armed robberies and purse-napping with threats
    of murder and harassment." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt According to the judge of
    this case, the evidence presented against Mr. Akrami was complaints by 200
    plaintiffs. In addition, robbery of 65 kilograms of gold, one billion
    Tumans worth of diamonds, coins, and cash, two purchased restaurants in
    Thailand and the EUA; several houses and cars and cell phones were also
    considered evidence against the defendants. (Iran newspaper on April 25,
    2002) Mr. Akrami had three previous criminal records. Defense According to
    the judicial report of the Iran newspaper, Mr. Akrami and four other
    defendants claimed in a court session that even though they participated
    in armed operations, they did not harm anybody. A Summary of the Defects
    of Mr. Farhad Akrami s Legal Proceedings No precise information is
    available about the proceedings in Farhad Akrami s case. However, based on
    certain media reports, he was sentenced for Moharebeh and Efsad fel-Arz.
    The reason for this ruling was participation in group armed robberies.
    According to Article 183 of the old Penal Code, Moharebeh takes place when
    an individual takes up arms with the intention of disrupting public safety
    and terrorizing the populace. Taking up arms means making use of such
    arms. Article 185 provides that an armed thief and bandit who has
    disrupted public safety and terrorized the populace is considered Mohareb.
    In the present case, even though robberies have occurred by a band, and
    might even have been armed, it does not appear these actions were to an
    extent to terrorize some of the people and endanger their public safety.
    When the law speaks of depriving people of their security and terror, it
    means a large number of people not one or several individuals. In other
    words, if an armed robbery occurs, naturally the safety of the victim
    and/or his/her neighbors will be disrupted but it cannot be said that the
    people s safety and security has been disrupted or taken away. In other
    words, the crime of Moharebeh occurs when it targets society, not a person
    or specific persons. This argument becomes stronger if we consider the
    Islamic Penal Code articles dealing with theft. According to Islamic Penal
    Code Article 651, When a theft does not meet the requirements for Hadd
    punishment but satisfies all the following five conditions, the offender
    shall be sentenced to five to twenty years imprisonment and up to 74
    lashes: 1-The theft is committed during the night. 2-The thieves are two
    or more individuals. 3-One or more of the thieves carry a visible or
    hidden weapon. 4-If the thief/thieves have climbed a wall or broken into a
    protected place or used a master key or impersonated civil servants or
    used their uniforms or titles, or if they committed the theft in a
    residential place or its attachments. 5-If [the thief/thieves] have
    threatened or harmed someone during the theft. Further, Article 652
    provides: If the theft harms someone, or if the thief is armed, he shall
    be sentenced to three months to ten years imprisonment and up to 74
    lashes; and if someone is injured, in addition to the punishment for
    injury, he shall be sentenced to the maximum punishment provided in this
    article. As can be observed, the law has provided for the punishments of
    flogging and imprisonment for a
