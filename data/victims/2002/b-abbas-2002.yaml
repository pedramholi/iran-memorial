    News of the execution of Mr. Abbas B. was published in the Iran newspaper
    on October 19, 2002. He was a street peddler. Arrest and Detention There
    is no specific information on Abbas B. s arrest and detention. Trial
    Branch Six of the Public Court of Sari tried Mr. Abbas B. No information
    is available on his trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Abbas B. was
    announced as murder. He was accused of murdering his ex-boss s son with
    blows of a knife on July 15, 2001. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Abbas B. was his confession. International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Abbas B.'s defense. Judgment The court
    condemned Mr. Abbas B. to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged at the Sari Prison yard on Wednesday October 16,
    2002 at dawn.
