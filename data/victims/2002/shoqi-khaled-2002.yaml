    News of the execution of Mr. Khaled Shoqi was published by various sources
    including the websites of the League for the Defense of Human Rights in
    Iran on October 12, 2002, and Asre-no on February 22, 2003, quoting the
    Statement by the Committee Action Alliance for Democracy. Additional
    information was taken from an interview by Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation (ABF) with a member of the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan in February of 2015. Mr. Shoqi was born in the
    Varmazyar-Barandiz Village near Orumieh in 1953. He was educated at a
    military school for six years during the Shah's regime. According to the
    archive of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Mr. Shoqi was a
    military commander of this party in the Orumieh area and participated in
    the military clash between the party and the Qazvin Armored Division near
    Orumieh in April of 1980. Due to his illness and with the permission of
    the party, Mr. Shoqi and his family went to Turkey and resided in
    Yuksakava where he continued his political activities for the party. (ABF
    interview) The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) was founded in
    1945 with the objective to gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in north-western
    Iran. After the Revolution, conflicts between the new central Shiite
    government and the mainly Sunni Kurdistan, regarding the role of
    minorities in the drafting of the constitution, specification of Shiite as
    the official state religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region,
    ended in armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga
    (the militia of the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1,
    when people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime. On
    August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan and
    declared it unofficial and illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke out
    and continued for several months in the region. By 1983, PDKI had lost
    much of its influence in the region. Various leaders of the PDKI have been
    assassinated Arrest and detention Mr. Shoqi was an Iranian Kurd refugee in
    Turkey who was arrested by the Turkish police in 1995.* He was taken to
    the security forces in Iran and was transferred to the prison where he was
    detained for seven years. According to the interviewee, the interrogators
    of the Intelligence Office in Orumieh pressured Mr. Shoqi to cooperate and
    tortured him severely. (Ettela'at.net on September 1, 2003) The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Shoqi s trial. Charges According to the
    interviewee, the charge against Mr. Shoqi was cooperation with the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan. (Asre-no on February 22, 2003) The

    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
