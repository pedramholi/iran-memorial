    News of the execution of an unknown person was published on the website of
    Khorasan newspaper on May 29, 2002. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of the defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch Two of
    the Public Court of Mashhad tried this defendant as the first row
    defendant. No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    The charge brought against the defendant was announced as armed robbery.
    He was charged as the first row defendant, along with another person, with
    armed robbery from Saderat Bank in Mashhad. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on the defendant s defense.
    Judgment Branch Two of the Public Court of Mashhad condemned the defendant
    to death for armed robbery. Branch 22 of the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged in public in Mashhad on January 12, 2002.
