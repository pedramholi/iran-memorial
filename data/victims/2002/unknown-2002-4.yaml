    News of the execution of an unknown person, along with three others, was
    published on the website of Khorasan newspaper on January 24, 2002.
    According to the existing information, the case against this person was
    related to the rape of a woman at Kalzarkesh, near Mashhad, in April of
    2001. Arrest and detention The circumstances of the defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch 41 of the Public Court of Mashhad
    tried this defendant and three others. No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges The charge brought against the defendant was
    announced as rape. He was charged that he, and three others, using force
    and threatening with a knife, raped a woman at Kalzarkesh near Mashhad in
    April of 2001. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against the defendant. Defense No information is available on
    the defendant s defense. Judgment Branch 41 of the Public Court of Mashhad
    condemned the defendant and three others to death. He was hanged, along
    with three others, in Mashhad Central Prison on January 23, 2002 at dawn.
    No specific information is available about this execution.
