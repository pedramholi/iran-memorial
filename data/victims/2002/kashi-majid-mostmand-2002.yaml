    News of the execution of Mr. Majid Mostmand Kashi, along with four others,
    was published in the Kayhan newspaper and on the website of Jamejam on
    November 10, 2002. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Mostmand
    Kashi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial According to reports, a
    branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran tried Mr. Mostmand
    Kashi. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges
    brought against Mr. Mostmand Kashi were announced as supply, distribution,
    and armed dealing of 2,215 kilograms of narcotics. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to reports and the evidence presented
    against Mr. Mostmand Kashi, he and other individuals created an armed gang
    operating in cities near the Afghanistan border in order to transfer and
    sell narcotics in Tehran, Karaj, Varamin, Shahr-e Ray, Yazd, and Kerman.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Mostmand Kashi s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Majid
    Mostmand Kashi to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged, along with four others, in Raja ishahr Prison in November of 2002.
    No specific information is available about his execution.
