    News of the execution of Mr. Hadi Nuri Katehkordi, along with two others,
    was published in the Iran newspaper on August 22, 2002. Additional
    information regarding his prosecution was taken from the Ettela at
    newspaper on February 27, 1999. Case of Mr. Nuri Katehkordi was in
    connection with the murder of his 19-year-old fianc in her home in Bahar
    Street in Tehran. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr. Nuri
    Katehkordi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branches 1601 and
    1607 of the Criminal Court of Tehran tried Mr. Nuri Katehkordi. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Nuri Katehkordi was announced as murder . Mr. Nuri went to meet his
    fianc in her home while her parents were not present on February 2, 1998,
    he then struck her with a knife several times, and suffocated her. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Nuri Katehkordi was
    his confession and report from the forensics during the trial, the
    testimony of a neighbor , and the recovery of a bloody jacket and hat in
    his house . The victim s father mentioned in the trial that he and his
    wife never found Mr. Nuri as a suitable husband for their daughter and
    they disagreed their marriage since the beginning. They eventually
    accepted their engagement due to Mr. Nuri s persistence and threats.
    Several months later, they broke the engagement based on their daughter s
    will but Mr. Nuri could not accept the fact and finally committed the
    crime. During a Qassameh* in the court, the victim s father, uncle,
    brother, and grandfather swore to the Qoran 50 times that Mr. Nuri
    Katehkordi was guilty. Defense During the interrogation, Mr. Nuri
    Katehkordi denied committing the murder. He mentioned that when he went to
    his fianc s home, she gave him the knife and while they were arguing, she
    threw herself on the knife (Ettela at). Judgment Both branches 1601 and
    1607 of the Criminal Court of Tehran s judges condemned Mr. Hadi Nuri
    Katehkordi to death based on Qassameh and the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. He was hanged in the Qasr Prison yard on August 21, 2002.
    ----------------------------------- * Qassameh means an oath taken by a
    group of people. It is one of the ways that a defendant s guilt or
    innocence can be proven for both intentional and non-intentional offenses.
    Per Iran s Islamic Penal Code, qassameh is carried out in instances where
    a crime has occurred and no convincing evidence or witnesses exist which
    could prove the defendant s guilt, and where a judge has doubt about the
    defendant s guilt based solely on circumstantial evidence a circumstance
    referred to in religious jurisprudence as lowth. Where lowth obtains, the
    judge is bound to ask the defendant to produce evidence disproving the
    charge. If the defendant demonstrates his innocence in this way, he is
    acquitted. Failing this, the plaintiff may perform qassameh in order to
    prove the defendant s guilt, or request that the defendant perform
    qassameh to disprove the charges. This procedure, which requires a
    defendant to prove his innocence, is contrary to the principle of
    presumption of innocence and violates the defendant s right to remain
    silent. The principle of the presumption of innocence - recognized in Iran
    s constitution, Code of Criminal Procedure, and international agreements
    to which Iran is signatory holds that all persons are to be considered
    innocent until proven guilty. A defendant should not be made to prove his
    own innocence. Proving the charges made against the defendant by
    presenting adequate evidence and witnesses is the duty of the prosecuting
    authority (in the Iranian context, the public prosecutor or a private
    plaintiff.) The right to remain silent is among the defendant s rights of
    defense, affording him the right to refrain from answering questions
    regarding the charges entered against him. Such silence may not be treated
    as an indication or evidence of guilt or innocence. In order to
    substantiate a charge of homicide through qassameh, an oath is required
    from 50 male relatives of the plaintiff. For the charge to be dismissed,
    fifty male relatives of the defendant must swear to his innocence. Should
    the number of male relatives taking the oath be less than 50, the
    defendant may repeat the oath himself in order to meet the required number
    of swears. In homicide cases, it is not possible for a plaintiff to repeat
    the oath in this way. It is not necessary for those taking the oath to
    have witnessed the commission of the crime themselves. In Hanafi
    jurisprudence, qassameh can only be carried out to disprove charges
    against a defendant, and a plaintiff may not use it to substantiate a
    defendant s guilt. In Shi a jurisprudence, however, qassameh is carried
    out in the first stage by the plaintiff to prove the charges against the
    defendant. Only where the plaintiff fore
