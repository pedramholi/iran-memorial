    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Hassani, son of Ali, was published
    in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on April 13, 2002. He was a resident of
    Kazerun. Arrest and detention According to the report, Mr. Hassani was
    rearrested after he had once been arrested and escaped prison. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Amol tried Mr. Hassani. No information is available
    on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Hassani was announced
    as drug trafficking. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The evidence presented against Mr. Hassani was selling 124 kilograms of
    opium. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hassani s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Amol condemned Mr. Mohammad
    Hassani to death. He was executed at the Amol Prison yard. The exact date
    of his execution is not known.
