    News of the execution of Mr. Ali Mazidi, along with two others, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on August 22, 2002. Additional information
    regarding his arrest and prosecution was taken from the Ettela at
    newspaper on July 23, August 24, and November 29, 2000, and the Iran
    newspaper on March 6, 2002. According to the existing information, Mr.
    Mazidi had a PhD in economics from Moscow University and was a parliament
    candidate for the Sixth Majles. However, after his defeat in the election,
    he found himself in debt. Arrest and Detention Agents of Circle 10 of the
    Intelligence Police arrested Mr. Mazidi at his house when he was sleeping
    on July 29, 2000. By the order of the Head of Police of Greater Tehran and
    the Deputy of Crime Recovery of this district, a team of detectives of
    this Circle was appointed in charge of the investigation and arrest in
    this case. Mr. Mazidi was detained for about one year. Trial According to
    the existing information, Branch 1601 of the Criminal Court of Tehran
    tried Mr. Mazidi and the first court session took place on August 23,
    2000. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Mazidi were announced as "murdering a person and assisting in
    murdering another person." He was charged with murdering a surgeon and a
    pharmacist for extortion in July of 2001 in collaboration with another
    person. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Mazidi
    was his confession and the confession of his collaborator. Also, during
    the search of his house, officials recovered two weapons, branded Browning
    and Berta, forged documents, a handcuff, and a chain. (Ettela at
    newspaper) International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense In his defense, Mr. Mazidi
    objected to the ruling and stated I am guilty [of a crime] but not a
    murderer. Judgment The Criminal Court of Tehran condemned Mr. Ali Mazidi
    to death, 17 years imprisonment, and 75 lashes. The Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in the presence of the victim s
    family, officials of Sentence Enforcement of the Criminal Court of Tehran,
    and the observer judge in Qasr Prison on August 21, 2002. No information
    is available about the lash ruling.
