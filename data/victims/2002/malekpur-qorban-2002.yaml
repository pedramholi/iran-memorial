    News of the execution of Mr. Qorban Malekpur was published on the website
    of Khorasan newspaper on May 29, 2002. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Malekpur s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    Branch Two of the Public Court of Mashhad tried Mr. Malekpur. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against
    Mr. Malekpur were announced as armed robbery, insecurity, and creating
    fear and intimidation. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Malekpur. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Malekpur s defense. Judgment Branch Two of the Public
    Court of Mashhad condemned Mr. Qorban Malekpur to death. Branch 22 of the
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in Mashhad Central
    Prison on May 28, 2002. No further information is available about this
    execution.
