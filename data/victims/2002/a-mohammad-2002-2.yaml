    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad A. was published in the Qods
    newspaper on July 6, 2002. He was 22 years old and resided in Esfahan.
    Arrest and detention Police arrested Mr. Mohammad A. in Esfahan in 2001
    following a murder. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial A court tried Mr. Mohammad A. in several sessions. No
    information is available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Mohammad A. was announced as murder. He was accused of killing his
    neighbor with blows of a knife following the victim s fight with his [Mr.
    Mohammad's] mother. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against Mr. Mohammad A. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mohammad A. s defense. Judgment A court condemned Mr.
    Mohammad A. to death. He was hanged in the presence of judicial and
    security officials in Esfahan in July of 2002. No specific information is
    available about his execution.
