    News of the execution of Mr. Sa id (Farid) Jahangiri, along with another
    person, was published in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on October 16, 2002
    and in the Kayhan newspaper on October 17, 2002. His case and the case of
    another defendant were related to a kidnapping, rape, and robbery at the
    Sepidar District in Ahvaz in March of 2002. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of Mr. Jahangiri s arrest and detention are not known. Trial
    The Ahvaz Courthouse tried Mr. Jahangiri. No information is available on
    his trial. Charges According to the Head of Ahvaz Courthouse, the charges
    brought against Mr. Jahangiri and the other defendant were collectively
    announced as kidnapping, rape, and robbery with harassment and
    intimidation. He and the other person had kidnapped a woman at the Sepidar
    District in Ahvaz, using his car, and stolen her belonging after raping
    her. (Jomhuri Eslami newspaper) The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented
    against Mr. Jahangiri was his confession and the confession of his
    collaborator, a complaint, and having a criminal record. International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Jahangiri s defense. Judgment The Ahvaz
    Courthouse condemned Mr. Sa id (Farid) Jahangiri to death for rape, to 15
    years imprisonment for kidnapping, and to 10 years imprisonment and 74
    lashes for robbery, based on Articles 2, 13, 47, 64, 82, 621, and 652 of
    the Islamic Penal Code. The Appeals Court of Province and the Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged in public at the crime scene at
    the Sepidar District in Ahvaz on October 16, 2002 at dawn. He also
    received lashes before his execution. The other defendant was executed at
    the same location on October 15, 2002.
