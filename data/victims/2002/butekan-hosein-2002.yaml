    The execution of Mr. Hosein Butekan was reported by the correspondent of
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily in Esfahan (web edition, April 28, 2002). Arrest
    and detention Based on a report from Esfahan's Security Command Center,
    quoted in the Jomhuri Eslami daily, the defendant was identified and
    arrested by the authorities 6 days after committing the crime. The
    circumstances of his arrest and detention remain unknown. Trial No
    information about the trial is provided. Charges Mr. Butekan was charged
    with murdering an 11-year-old child, Alireza Madkar, in January 25, 2001
    in Kashan. Based on the report, the defendant had kidnapped the child in
    an attempt to extort money from his father, a friend of the defendant's.
    He had tied up the child, stuffed some cotton in his mouth to silence his
    screaming, and left to notify the child's father; but upon return, he had
    found the child suffocated. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report
    mentioned that Mr. Butekan confessed to his crime, but the circumstances
    of obtaining his confession remain unknown. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Butekan's defense. Judgment The Second Branch of Kashan's
    Judiciary sentenced Mr. Butekan to retaliation (Qisas) for murder. After
    confirmation by the Supreme Court of the Country, the sentence was carried
    out 84 days after the defendant s arrest, on a Thursday.
