    News of the execution of Mr. Mo in H. was published in the Jamejam
    newspaper on July 5, 2002. Arrest and Detention There is no specific
    information on Mr. Mo in H s arrest and detention. Trial The Head of
    Branch 35 of the Karaj Criminal Court issued the ruling. No information is
    available on Mr. Mo in H s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Mo in H.
    was announced as "murder." According to the report, he and his wife
    murdered a taxi driver in order to steal his car. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Mo in H. was his confession, confession of
    his wife, and recovered proofs and signs. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Mo in H s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mo
    in H. to death and the Supreme Court confirmed it. The ruling was carried
    out in presence of the judge of Sentence Enforcement in Karaj. Mr. Mo in
    H. was hanged in Karaj on July 4, 2002.
