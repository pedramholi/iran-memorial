    News of the execution of Mr. Morteza Ma sumi, known as Farshid and son of
    Nosrat, along with five others, was published in the Iran newspaper on
    April 27, 2002. Additional information was taken from various sources
    including the Iran newspaper on April 22, 24, and 25, 2002 and in the
    Jamejam newspaper on April 24, 2002. Mr. Ma sumi s case was related to his
    membership in a purse-napping gang called Jamileh that committed several
    robberies and purse-nappings in various cities including Shiraz, Esfahan,
    Tabriz, and Rasht in Iran and in other Persian Gulf countries between 1998
    and 1999. Members of this gang consisted of 33 individuals and, according
    to the judge, 14 of them participated in armed robbery and extortion.
    Arrest and Detention Detectives of Branch 18 of the Intelligence Police in
    Tehran arrested Mr. Ma sumi, along with other members of the Jamileh gang.
    According to the judge of this case, they were arrested following some
    internal disputes and recovery of the near-dead body of an important
    member of the gang in a wilderness and his confession three years earlier
    in 1999. (Iran newspaper on April 25, 2002) The circumstances of Mr. Ma
    sumi s arrest and detention are not known except that he was detained at
    the Raja ishahr (Gohardasht) Prison during his last months. Trial Branch
    15 of the Imam Khomeieni Public Court in Tehran tried Mr. Ma sumi in
    several sessions in the summer of 2001. No further information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Ma sumi were
    announced as "acts against internal security and intimidation by leading
    and committing 22 armed robberies and purse-napping with threats of murder
    and assault with a dagger." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of Guilt According to the judge of
    this case, the evidence presented against Mr. Ma sumi was confessions of
    defendants and complaints by 200 plaintiffs. In addition, robbery of 65
    kilograms of gold, one billion Tumans worth of diamonds, coins, and cash,
    two purchased restaurants in Thailand and the EUA; several houses and cars
    and cell phones were also considered evidence against the defendants.
    (Iran newspaper on April 25, 2002) Mr. Ma sumi had three previous criminal
    records. Defense According to the judicial report of the Iran newspaper,
    Mr. Ma sumi and four others claimed in a court session that even though
    they participated in armed operations, but they did not harm anybody.
    Judgment Branch 15 of the Public Court in Tehran identified Mr. Morteza Ma
    sumi as a fighter against God and corruptor on Earth and condemned him to
    death in September of 2001. Branch 32 of the Supreme Court confirmed the
    ruling. Mr. Ma sumi was hanged in public at Azadi Square (Bus terminal) in
    Tehran on April 25, 2002 at 6:45 a.m.
