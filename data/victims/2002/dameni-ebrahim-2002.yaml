    In response to threats of execution during his interrogation, Mr. Dameni
    stated: "My execution will be your shame because people will realize that
    instead of answering my arguments, you chose to kill me." Information
    regarding the extrajudicial execution of Mohammad Ebrahim Dameni, son of
    Golshah and Zeinab, born in Tando Allahyar, Sindh Province, Pakistan,
    married and father of 16 children, was obtained through interviews with
    his son, Mohammad Osman Dameni, conducted on three separate occasions
    (December 12, 2022; December 18, 2023; and February 2, 2024). Additional
    information was gathered from the book Withered Flowers: The Martyrs of
    Sunni Muslims in Iran (November 22, 2021), the book The Destruction of
    Gornak: Mistake or Conspiracy by Mohammad Armian (2000), the Noor
    International Network YouTube channel (January 28, 2012), the Neday-e Haq
    TV YouTube channel (May 14, 2012), the Sunnat Online website (May 31,
    2020), the Baloch Activists Campaign (April 16, 2019), and the Edalat News
    website (June 11, 2016). Mohammad Ebrahim Dameni was born on October 29,
    1950 (Noor International Network YouTube Channel, January 28, 2012). His
    father had previously migrated to Pakistan, then under Indian rule, from
    the Sarbaz district due to various hardships, including drought. Dameni
    spent his childhood and adolescence there. From an early age, he developed
    a keen interest in the Quran and religious studies. He quickly enrolled in
    a traditional maktab (religious school) and, at the age of seven, learned
    to read the entire Quran fluently within a month. At the same time, he
    enrolled in a public school in Pakistan, where he excelled academically
    and advanced through the grades at an accelerated pace compared to his
    peers (ABC Interview with Mohammad Osman Dameni, December 12, 2022; Noor
    International Network YouTube Channel, January 28, 2012). However, after
    his school was closed due to lack of students, he shifted his focus
    entirely to Islamic studies. In 1960, he continued his education first at
    Madina Al-Uloom Behinda Sharif, a larger institution, and later at Darul
    Uloom Tando Allahyar, which was established after Pakistan's independence
    (ABC Interview with Mohammad Osman Dameni, December 12, 2022; Sunnat
    Online, May 31, 2020). After graduating from a religious seminary in
    Pakistan and receiving the title of Molavi*, Mr. Dameni returned to Iran
    at about the age of 20 (ABC Interview with Mohammad Osman Dameni, December
    12, 2022; Sunnat Online, May 31, 2020). Until 1978, he worked at the
    Abdollah Ravanbod Religious School, also known as Sa'adi Baluchistan,
    located at the zero-point border between Iran and Pakistan. Later he moved
    with his family from the border areas to Iranshahr. Upon his arrival in
    Iranshahr, he assumed the role of Imam at the Makki Mosque and initiated
    two important programs: Quran interpretation sessions and reformist
    theological lectures. During the 1979 revolution, at the suggestion of
    Molavi Qamareddin, he began teaching at the Shams-ul-Uloom School in
    Iranshahr and later at the Haqqanie School. After the revolution, Mr.
    Dameni was hired by the Ministry of Education as a teacher of religious
    studies at the middle school level. However, because the official
    curriculum did not include Sunni beliefs, he attempted to teach Sunni
    theological principles beyond the standard textbooks. This led to his
    dismissal from the Ministry of Education after only a few months (ABC
    Interview with Mohammad Osman Dameni, December 12, 2022; Sunnat Online,
    May 31, 2020; Noor International Network YouTube Channel, January 28,
    2012). According to Mohammad Ebrahim Dameni's son, in 1980 he was one of
    the key members of the "Union of Muslims" organization recently founded by
    Mullah Mohammad Omar Sarbazi** in southern Baluchistan, Iran. In the same
    year, the Iranian government dissolved the organization and dispersed its
    members (ABC Interview with Mohammad Osman Dameni, December 12, 2022). In
    August 1982, Mr. Dameni was summoned by security officials and arrested
    for his religious activities and ideological speeches, particularly in
    defense of the Sunni faith. (ABC Interview with Mohammad Osman Dameni,
    December 12, 1982). Even during his interrogations, he spoke with
    remarkable boldness and conviction. In one of his public speeches after
    his release, he recalled an exchange with his interrogator: "I said it
    right there, inside [the prison]. The man who was interrogating me in
    Iranshahr, after hearing my argument, was astonished and asked, 'If what
    you say is true, then you have completely destroyed us! I replied, 'Well,
    I don't know if I have destroyed you or if you have been destroyed. (Noor
    International Network YouTube Channel, January 28, 2012). During his
    initial interrogation, he was repeatedly threatened with execution. In
    response, he firmly stated: "My execution will be your shame because
    people will realize that instead of answering my argument, you chose to
    kill me." During this detention, Mr. Dameni was accused
