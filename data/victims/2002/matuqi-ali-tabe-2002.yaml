    The circumstances of Mr. Tabe Ma tuqi s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Tabe Ma tuqi s trial.
    Charges The charges brought against Mr. Tabe Ma tuqi were announced as
    robbery and rape. According to the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, quoting the

    kidnapped a woman using a car at the Sepidar District in Ahvaz in March of
    2002. They stole her belongings after raping her. The validity of the

    evidence provided against Mr. Tabe Ma tuqi was his confession to several
    robberies and a complaint regarding a rape. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Tabe Ma tuqi s defense. Judgment According to the Head
    of Khuzestan Courthouse, Mr. Ali Tabe Ma tuqi was condemned to death based

    47, and 2 of the Islamic Penal Code. The ruling was carried out at the
    location of the crime at the Sepidar District in Ahvaz when he was hanged
    in public at dawn on October 15, 2002.
