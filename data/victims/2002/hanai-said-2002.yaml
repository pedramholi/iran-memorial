    Mr. Hana i was a 39-year-old mason, married with three children, carried a
    Bassij membership card, and served on the front lines of the Iran-Iraq war
    News of Mr. Sa id Hana i s execution on April 17, 2002, was published in
    Jam-e Jam newspaper (April 17, 2002). Additional information about this
    case was obtained from numerous reports in Iran Newspaper (July 28, 29,
    and 31, 2001 August 1, 2001, September 16, 2001, October 13, 17, and 25,
    2001), ISNA (September 22, and October 12, 2001), and the documentary film
    And the Spider Came, containing interviews with the defendant, the
    defendant s family, the victims families, and Mr. Hana i s relatives. Mr.
    Sa id Hana i, child of Ali Asghar, was 39 years old and resided in the
    city of Mashhad. He had a fifth grade education, was married, and had
    three children: one boy and two girls. Mr. Hana i had served on the front
    in the Iran-Iraq war. He was a mason (building contractor) and, according
    to his wife, had a religious disposition. Mr. Hana i had previously
    undergone treatment for mental and psychological issues (Iran Newspaper,
    July 29, 2001). Mr. Hana i s case is related the discovery of the bodies
    of 16 women aged 18 to 55 years old between July 2000 and July 2001 in
    Mashhad, who had been murdered in the same fashion. The case came to be
    known as the spider murders. According to media reports, the victims had
    criminal records related to drugs, vagrancy, and moral turpitude. It took
    an entire year to arrest the defendant in this case. The case had
    attracted much media attention, and as time went by, the number of victims
    kept rising. The then-commander of the Police Force, Mr. Qalibaf,
    attributed the delay in identifying the murderer and preventing further
    murders to the fact that the victims had been banished and disowned by
    their families and their families had therefore not alerted and complained
    to the police. Upon Hana i s arrest, the Khorassan Province Bassij
    Organization brought a complaint against him for forging a Bassij
    membership card. Arrest and detention Based on available information, one
    of the victims had been able to run away from her attacker and provided
    his personal information and address to the police. Thus, one year after
    the first murder, Mr. Hana i was identified and arrested. He was
    interrogated by Criminal Investigations officers. No information is
    available on the manner of his interrogation. Mr. Haha i was taken to
    Mashhad Prison at the close of the interrogations. Trial Mr. Sa id Hana i
    s trial took place at the Mashhad General Court Branch 53, in four
    sessions (three of which were public, and one closed) on September 22, and
    on October 10, 11, and 16, 2000. The first trial session was convened at
    the Mashhad Judiciary Meeting Hall, with the next of kin, the defendant,
    and his attorney in attendance. The Prosecutor s representative proceeded
    to read the indictment against the defendant, pointing to the negative
    effects of such murders on society s fundamental social and cultural
    structure, stating that they create insecurity, agitated minds, and
    fostered instability across the board. He asked for the harshest possible
    sentence for the defendant, and asked for a closed-door trial session in
    order to address charges of adultery. Given that Mr. Hana i had claimed
    that the victims deserved to be killed, the Prosecutor s representative
    stated that the victims petty criminal records were not grounds to
    pronounce them mahdur ul-dam (literally meaning one who has forfeited one
    s blood ; this is a person whose blood, according to religious law, can be
    shed without penalty or punishment for the murderer) and asked that the
    defendant be sentenced and punished expeditiously. The victims families
    then proceeded to bring their complaints (ISNA, September 22, 2000). Mr.
    Hana i s second trial session which was due to take place on September 29,
    2000, was postponed due to his lawyer s resignation, and was convened on
    October 10, 2000, upon designation of a court-appointed lawyer. Mr. Hana i
    proceeded to describe the murders in detail in this session. In bringing
    Khorassan Province Bassij Organization s complaint, its legal
    representative stated: A Bassiji is the protector of order in society, he
    is not the cause of disorder in society Can this corrupt being be an
    appropriate model for society and the people? (ISNA, October 10, 2000). In
    the third session which took place on October 11, 2000, the judge cited
    the Medical Examiner s report which had declared the defendant of sound
    mind. The Prosecutor s representative had asked the court to sentence the
    defendant to the harshest possible punishment on that basis. Mr. Hana i s
    court-appointed lawyer was present at the session (Iran newspaper, October
    13, 2000). Based on available information, Mr. Hana i s last trial
    session, convened on October 16, 2000, was a closed-door session (Iran
    newspaper, October 17, 2000). Charges The court charged Mr. Sa id Hana i
    with 16 counts of intentional murder, 13 counts o
