    News of the execution of Mr. Jaber Talebi, along with two others, was
    published in the Ettela at newspaper on June 1 and in the Kayhan newspaper
    on June 2, 2002. Arrest and Detention There is no specific information on
    Mr. Talebi s arrest and detention. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court
    of Shiraz tried Mr. Talebi. No information is available on his trial.
    Charges According to the Kayhan newspaper, quoting an official, the
    charges against Mr. Talebi and another defendant were collectively
    announced as "dealing 10 kilograms of heroin and over 250 kilograms of
    other narcotics." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Talebi. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Talebi's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Shiraz condemned Mr. Jaber Talebi to death and the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at Adelabad Prison in Shiraz. The
    exact date of this execution is unknown.
