circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Hassan Afghani, along with two others, was
    published in the Ettela at newspaper (June 1, 2002) and in the Kayhan
    newspaper (June 2, 2002). Mr. Afghani was 35 years old. Arrest and
    Detention There is no specific information on Mr. Afghani s arrest and
    detention. Trial The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shiraz tried Mr.
    Afghani. No information is available on his trial. Charges According to
    the Kayhan newspaper, quoting an official, the charge against Mr. Afghani
    was announced as "body packing 450 kilograms of heroin." The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers
    have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to
    meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989
    law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The
    exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against Mr. Afghani.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Afghani's defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shiraz condemned Mr. Hassan Afghani to
    death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at
    Adelabad Prison in Shiraz. The exact date of this execution is unknown.
