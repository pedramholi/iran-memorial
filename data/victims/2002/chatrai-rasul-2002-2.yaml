    News of the execution of Mr. Rasul Chatra i, son of Abbas, was published
    in the Kayhan newspaper on April 8, 2002, and in Ettela at and Iran
    newspapers on April 11, 2002. Additional information regarding his arrest
    and prosecution was published on the Jamejam website on January 22, 2002,
    and in the Kayhan newspaper on April 6, 2002. Mr. Chatra i was the leader
    of a 14-member gang that had committed piracy, armed robbery, and murder
    of drivers on roads around Esfahan. Arrest and Detention There is no
    specific information on Mr. Chatra i s arrest and detention. Trial Branch
    36 of the Public Court in Esfahan tried Mr. Chatra i and the other members
    of his gang. (Jamejam website) Charges According to the existing
    information, the charges against Mr. Chatra i were announced as
    "participation in six armed robberies and committing two murders." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Chatra i was having a
    record for sedition, extortion, and harassment of the public honor, in
    addition to his confession during the interrogation. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    During his trial, Mr. Chatra i denied the murder charge of two individuals
    and claimed that the second row defendant was responsible. However, this
    defendant rejected Mr. Chatra i s claim. (Jamejam website) Judgment Branch
    36 of the Public Court in Esfahan condemned Mr. Chatra i, the first row
    defendant, to death (two counts), 15 years imprisonment, 74 lashes, and
    paying Dieh (blood money) to the victims. The Head of Judiciary confirmed
    the ruling. He was hanged in public at the Artesh (Army) Square in Esfahan
    on April 7, 2002. A victim s mother carried out the ruling. No information
    is available about his lash ruling being carried out before his execution.
