circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Hassan Musavi was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily (web edition, June 05, 2002) and Iran daily (web edition, June 06,
    2002) . Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial, except that it was held five months after the alleged
    crime. Charges Mr. Musavi was charged with murdering a man named Mohammad
    Rashidi. Reportedly, he had stolen Mr. Rashidi's car after murdering him
    in Ganjab, a village in the outskirts of Malayer. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Musavi's defense. Judgment Mr. Musavi was sentenced to
    death as retaliation (Qisas) for murder at Malayer's Judiciary. The
    verdict was confirmed by the Supreme Court and approbated by the Head of
    Judiciary. He was hanged in public in Malayer's central square on June 03,
    2002. The religious judge head of Malayer s Judiciary commented before the
    sentence was carried out: "Public enforcement of certain sentences
    guarantees safety in the society, and we hope that punishments like this
    will teach a lesson to criminals and violators of the law."
