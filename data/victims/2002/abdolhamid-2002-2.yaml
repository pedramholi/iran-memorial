    News of the execution of Mr. Abdolhamid, without a last name, along with
    four others, was published in the Khorasan newspaper on May 20 and 21,
    2002, and in the Ettela at newspaper on May 21, 2002. Additional
    information was taken from the Ettela at newspaper on April 30, 2002 and
    the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on May 18, 2002. Mr. Abdolhamid s case was
    related to an international twelve-member gang of drug traffickers who
    transported narcotics to Europe via a Persian Gulf country. (Ettela at
    newspaper) Arrest and detention Mr. Abdolhamid was arrested on April 27,
    2002 and detained for 23 days. According to the Sentence Enforcement
    judge, he was arrested, along with his collaborators, at the Beirut
    elevated area near Sabzevar during a clash with security and Basij forces.
    According to the Khorasan newspaper report, seven smugglers and three
    Basij members in Bardaskan were killed during this clash; however,
    according to the Ettela at newspaper, six smugglers were killed during a
    clash with security forces in Bardaskan and only one individual was
    arrested. Trial Mr. Abdolhamid was tried; however, no information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges brought against Mr. Abdolhamid
    and his collaborators were collectively announced as sedition, carrying
    weapons, drug trafficking, participation in a clash with the security and
    Basij forces, and murdering four Basij members. (Khorasan newspaper on May
    21, 2002) The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death
    sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of
    proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based
    on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the
    Sentence Enforcement judge, the evidence against Mr. Abdolhamid and his
    collaborators was recovery of 500 grams of morphine, 17 Kalashnikov
    rifles, RPG, a Goryunov weapon [PK machine gun], and three satellite
    phones. (Khorasan newspaper on May 20, 2002) Defense Before being
    executed, Mr. Abdolhamid and his collaborators told the Khorasan reporter
    that they only carried narcotics as guerillas and intended to deliver them
    at the border with Turkey. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Abdolhamid to
    death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along
    with his collaborators, in Mashhad Central Prison on May 20, 2002.
