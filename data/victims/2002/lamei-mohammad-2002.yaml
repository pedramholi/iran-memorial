    News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad Lame i, along with three others, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on May 16, 2002. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on Lame i s arrest and detention. Trial
    Branch 1402 of the Criminal Court of Tehran tried Mr. Lame i on November
    6, 2000. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charge
    against Mr. Lame i was announced as "murder." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Lame i. Defense No information is available on Mr. Lame i s defense.
    Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohammad Lame i to death. The Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged out at the Qasr Prison yard in
    Tehran on May 15, 2002.
