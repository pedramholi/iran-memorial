    News of the execution of Mr. Alireza K., along with another person, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on March 10, 2002. Arrest and Detention
    There is no specific information on Mr. Alireza K. s arrest and detention.
    Trial Branch Three of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shiraz tried Mr.
    Alireza K. No information is available on his trial. Charges The charges
    against Mr. Alireza K. were announced as "armed robberies, shooting,
    creating public intimidation and an atmosphere of fear, and acting against
    national security." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Alireza K. was a stolen vehicle, his
    getting into a fight with the owner of the vehicle, and injuring the owner
    s wife with a gunshot. Defense No information is available on Mr. Alireza
    K.'s defense. Judgment Branch Three of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Shiraz condemned Mr. Alireza K. to death and the Supreme Court confirmed
    the ruling. He was hanged in Shiraz. The exact date of this execution is
    unknown.
