place_of_death: "Ilam"
province: "Ilam"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Hanging"
circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Majid Mozafari was announced in a report by the
    Public Relations Office of Ilam's Justice Department, quoted by the
    Jomhuri Eslami daily (web edition, June 06, 2002). Arrest and detention
    The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr.
    Mozafari was charged with "murdering two women in 2001". Reportedly, he
    had "murdered his two female relatives, ages 86 and 18, for family
    conflicts." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Musavi's
    defense. Judgment Mr. Mozafari was sentenced to death as retaliation for
    manslaughter at Ilam's Justice Department. Confirmed by the Supreme Court
    and authorized by the Head of the Judiciary, the verdict was carried out
    in the morning in the presence of the family of the murdered women.
