    News of the execution of Mr. Reza Soltani, son of Hossein, along with five
    others, was published in the Iran newspaper on April 27, 2002. Additional
    information was taken from various sources including the Iran newspaper on
    April 22, 24, and 25, 2002 and in the Jamejam newspaper on April 24, 2002.
    Mr. Soltani s case was related to his membership in a purse-napping gang
    called Jamileh that committed several robberies and purse-nappings in
    various cities including Shiraz, Esfahan, Tabriz, and Rasht in Iran and in
    other Persian Gulf countries between 1998 and 1999. Members of this gang
    consisted of 33 individuals and, according to the judge, 14 of them
    participated in armed robbery and extortion. According to the Iran
    newspaper, Mr. Soltani was the gang leader. (April 22, 2002) Arrest and
    Detention Detectives of Branch 18 of the Intelligence Police in Tehran
    arrested Mr. Soltani, along with other members of the Jamileh gang.
    According to the judge of this case, they were arrested following some
    internal disputes and recovery of the near-dead body of an important
    member of the gang in a wilderness and his confession three years earlier
    in 1999. (Iran newspaper on April 25, 2002) The circumstances of Mr.
    Soltani s arrest and detention are not known except that he was detained
    at the Raja ishahr (Gohardasht) Prison during his last months. Trial
    Branch 15 of the Imam Khomeieni Public Court in Tehran tried Mr. Soltani
    in several sessions in the summer of 2001. No further information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Soltani were
    announced as "acts against internal security by intimidation and
    committing 22 armed robberies and purse-napping with threats of murder,
    assault with a knife and a dagger, clashes with agents on duty, and
    forgery of official documents and using them including an identification
    card." The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. Evidence of Guilt According to the judge of this case, the evidence
    presented against Mr. Soltani was confessions of defendants and complaints
    by 200 plaintiffs. In addition, robbery of 65 kilograms of gold, one
    billion Tumans worth of diamonds, coins, and cash, two purchased
    restaurants in Thailand and the EUA; several houses and cars and cell
    phones were also considered evidence against the defendants. (Iran
    newspaper on April 25, 2002) Mr. Soltani had 18 criminal convictions.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Soltani's defense; however,
    during the trial he admitted 17 out of 22 criminal convictions. Judgment
    Branch 15 of the Public Court in Tehran identified Mr. Reza Soltani as a
    fighter against God and corruptor on Earth and condemned him to death.
    Branch 32 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. Mr. Soltani was
    hanged in public and in the presence of his family in Atabak Street in
    Khavaran, Tehran, on April 25, 2002 at 6:45 a.m.
