    News of the execution of Mr. Karim Tujehli was published on the websites
    of Asre-no on February 22, 2002. It was also reflected in a public call by
    the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran to human rights organizations on
    September 1, 2003. Mr. Tujehli was a member of The Kurdish Democratic
    Party of Iran. The Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI) was founded in
    1945 with the objective to gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in north-west
    Iran. After the Revolution, conflicts between the new central Shiite
    government and mainly Sunni Kurdistan regarding the role of minorities in
    the drafting of the constitution, specification of Shiite as the official
    state religion, and particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in
    armed clashes between the Revolutionary Guards and the Peshmerga (the
    militia of the PDKI). The PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, 1979
    when people went to polls to vote for or against the Islamic regime. On
    August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan and
    declared it unofficial and illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke out
    and continued for several months. By 1983, PDKI had lost much of its
    influence in the region. Various leaders of the PDKI have been
    assassinated. Arrest and detention According to the public call by the
    Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran, in collaboration with the Turkish
    police, the Iranian regime extradited Mr. Tujehli and several other
    political refugees as smugglers and crooks. Mr. Tujehli was transferred to
    the Orumieh Prison immediately and detained until February of 2002. He was
    tortured in the prison. The circumstances of his arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Tujehli s trial.
    Charges According to the Committee for United Action for Democracy, the
    charge brought against Mr. Tujehli was announced as cooperation with the
    Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Mr. Tujehli. Defense No information is available on Mr. Tujehli s
    defense. Judgment Mr. Karim Tujehli was executed at the Orumieh Prison on
    January 24, 2002. There is no detail information about this execution.
