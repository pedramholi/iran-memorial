    News of the execution of Mr. Mas ud Parvizi Omran (without the last name)
    was published in the Iran newspaper on October 31, 2002. Additional
    information was also published in the Iran newspaper on June 19, 21, 22,
    24, 27, 30, July 6, 7, and 15, 2002, and on the website of Jamejam on June
    26, 2002. Mr. Parvizi Omran was single, from Amol, a resident of Tehran,
    and a medical student at the Army University in Tehran. His case was
    related to the kidnapping and murder of a nine-year-old boy on May 5,
    2002, and the murder of a 24-year-old man on December 24, 2000. Agents of
    Branch 10 of the Criminal Investigator in Tehran had arrested Mr. Parvizi
    Omran in January of 2001 in connection with recovery of the body of his
    close friend. He was detained for 48 hours but released due to lack of
    evidence against him. However, during his trial for the murder of a
    nine-year-old boy, the family of the first victim read the news and went
    to the Criminal Investigator in Tehran claiming that Mr. Parvizi Omran had
    murdered their 24-year-old son too. (Iran newspaper on June 24, 2002)
    Arrest and Detention Mr. Parvizi Omran was arrested for the second time by
    a special team of the Criminal Investigator in Amol in cooperation with
    the Farjam Police Station 136 at the eastern Tehran on June 16, 2002 (Iran
    newspaper on June 19, 2002). According to the existing information, the
    father of the nine-year-old victim contacted the Emergency Police 110
    after disappearance of his son and receiving a call from someone with a
    Kurdish accent demanding $100k and 4 million Tumans to release his son.
    Based on this report, a special base was established headed by the judge
    of Branch 10 of Amol Courthouse, including the Commander of Police in
    Mazandaran and the Criminal Investigator s Office in Amol. On the morning
    of April 20, 2002, the requested money was given to the kidnapper and
    police were unable to arrest him. However, police agents were able to
    arrest Mr. Parvizi Omran, who had purchased an expensive car about the
    same time, by cellphone tracing. He was transferred to the Amol Prison. He
    was interrogated twice. His first interrogation was related to the
    kidnapping and murder of a nine-year-old child. His second interrogation
    concerned the murder of a young man on January 24, 2001. By the order of
    the Head of Branch 1601 of the Criminal Court of Tehran, a group of
    criminal police agents travelled to Amol to interrogate Mr. Parvizi Omran
    twice. He was detained at the Amol Prison for about six months. Trial
    Branch Ten of Amol Courthouse tried Mr. Parvizi Omran. The Mazandaran
    Courthouse requested the location of this trial (Iran newspaper June 30,
    2002). He was tried for two cases out of turn and under extraordinary
    circumstances (Iran newspaper June 27, 2002). The first court session took
    place at the office of Deputy Judiciary in Amol on July 4, 2002. During
    this session, at the request by the judge, the confession video of Mr.
    Parvizi Omran was played for those present. The Public Prosecutor demanded
    the maximum penalty of death in public against the defendant. This session
    took four hours (Iran newspaper July 6, 2002). The second court session
    took place at Branch Ten of Amol Courthouse on July 6, 2002 (Iran
    newspaper July 7, 2002). Charges The charges against Mr. Parvizi Omran
    were announced as "kidnapping and murdering a nine-year-old boy and
    murdering a 24-year-old man." (Iran newspaper July 15, 2002) The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of Guilt The evidence presented against Mr. Parvizi Omran was
    finding bodies belonging to a nine-year-old boy and a 24-year-old man,
    receiving money from the father of the nine-year-old boy, recovery of some
    of the extorted money in the defendant s home, his confession, testimonies
    of parents of the 24-year-old man, complaints by the victims families,
    contradictory statements by the defendant during the trial, and a movie
    that reconstructed the murder at the defendant s house. Mr. Parvizi Omran
    confessed that because he knew his father s cousin was rich, he had
    kidnapped his child. On the day of the incident, he had asked the child to
    get into his car and he did so without any resistance because they were
    acquaintances. He drove to a rented villa in Mahmudabad. Later he
    transferred the child to his own house in Tehran. He told the child that
    he was making a movie in which he had to play the main role. He then
    contacted the family several times to get the money for releasing the
    child. Finally, he was able to receive the money. But, since the child
    knew him, he was forced to kill him. Regarding the 24-year-old man, money
    was the motive. The young man had access to his father s company account
    and they could get some money by forging the father s signature.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic us
