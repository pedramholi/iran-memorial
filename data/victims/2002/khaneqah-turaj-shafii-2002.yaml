    News of the execution of Mr. Turaj Shafi i Khaneqah, son of Avaz, along
    with five others, was published in the Iran newspaper on April 27, 2002.
    Additional information was taken from various sources including the Iran
    newspaper on April 22, 24, and 25, 2002 and in the Jamejam newspaper on
    April 24, 2002, and an electronic form sent to the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation by a person familiar with his case. Mr. Shafi i Khaneqah s case
    was related to his membership in a purse-napping gang called Jamileh that
    committed several robberies and purse-nappings in various cities including
    Shiraz, Esfahan, Tabriz, and Rasht in Iran and in other Persian Gulf
    countries between 1998 and 1999. Members of this gang consisted of 33
    individuals and, according to the judge, 14 of them participated in armed
    robbery and extortion. Mr. Shafi i Khaneqah, 32, was single and from
    Masal, Talesh. He was a high school graduate and a professional. According
    to the electronic form report, when he was only 10 years old, his father
    was shot to death during a revolutionary event on September 8, 1978. He
    became in charge of his family of four siblings and his mother. Arrest and
    Detention Detectives of Branch 18 of the Intelligence Police in Tehran
    arrested Mr. Shafi i Khaneqah, along with other members of the Jamileh
    gang. According to the judge of this case, they were arrested following
    some internal disputes and recovery of the near-dead body of an important
    member of the gang in a wilderness, and his confession three years
    earlier, in 1999 (Iran newspaper on April 25, 2002). According to the
    electronic form report, he was arrested in Tehran in the winter of 2000,
    and his family were not informed. The circumstances of Mr. Shafi i
    Khaneqah s arrest and detention are not known except that he was detained
    at the Raja ishahr (Gohardasht) Prison during his last months. Trial
    Branch 15 of the Imam Khomeieni Public Court in Tehran tried Mr. Shafi i
    Khaneqah in several sessions in the summer of 2001. No further information
    is available on his trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Shafi i
    Khaneqah were announced as "acts against internal security and
    intimidation by committing 24 armed robberies and purse-napping with
    threats of murder." According to the electronic form report, the charges
    against him were false and had been imposed on the defendants forcefully.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of Guilt According to the judge of this case, the evidence
    presented against Mr. Shafi i Khaneqah was confessions of defendants and
    complaints by 200 plaintiffs. In addition, robbery of 65 kilograms of
    gold, one billion Tumans worth of diamonds, coins, and cash, two purchased
    restaurants in Thailand and the UAE. Several houses and cars and cell
    phones were also considered evidence against the defendants (Iran
    newspaper on April 25, 2002). According to the electronic form report, no
    evidence existed against Mr. Shafi i Khaneqah. Defense According to the
    judicial report of the Iran newspaper, Mr. Shafi i Khaneqah and four
    others claimed in a court session that even though they participated in
    armed operations, they did not harm anybody. Judgment Branch 15 of the
    Public Court in Tehran identified Mr. Turaj Shafi i Khaneqah as a fighter
    against God and corruptor on Earth and condemned him to death. Branch 32
    of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. Mr. Shafi i Khaneqah was
    hanged, along with another defendant of this case, at the Qasr Prison yard
    in Tehran on April 25, 2002 in the morning. According to the electronic
    form report, in order to avoid being hanged in public, Mr. Shafi i
    Khaneqah hanged himself by his clothes in solitary confinement at Qasr
    Prison the night before his execution was scheduled. His body was buried
    at the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in Tehran.
