    News of the execution of Mr. Rahim Amiri, an Afghan citizen, was published
    on the website of the Khorasan newspaper on May 25, 2002. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Mr. Amiri s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial No information is available on Mr. Amiri s trial. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Amiri was announced as murder. He was accused
    of murdering his brother in collaboration with his brother s wife. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Amiri. Defense No information is available on Mr. Amiri s defense.
    Judgment A court condemned Mr. Rahim Amiri to death. He was hanged in
    public at Shahid Beheshti Square in Semnan on May 23, 2002. No specific
    information is available about this execution.
