circumstances: >
    News of the execution of Mr. Rasul Imani, son of Esma il, was published in
    the Ettela at newspaper on July 10 and in the Kayhan newspaper on June 10,
    2002. He was from Ajabshir in Azarbaijan-e Sharqi province. Arrest and
    Detention According to reports, Mr. Imani was arrested at the Eslami
    Island Police Station while transporting narcotics from Orumieh to Tabriz
    in 2001. There is no specific information on his arrest and detention.
    Trial Branch Three of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tabriz tried Mr.
    Imani. No information is available on his trial. Charges According to the
    Kayhan newspaper, quoting the Sentence Enforcement of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tabriz, the charge against Mr. Imani was announced
    as "drug trafficking." The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution did not provide any specific information on
    the evidence presented against Mr. Imani. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Imani's defense. Judgment Branch Three of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tabriz condemned Mr. Rasul Imani to death and the
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at the Tabriz Prison
    yard. The exact date of this execution is unknown. According to the
    report, his properties were also confiscated.
