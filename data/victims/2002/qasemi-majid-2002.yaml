    Information about the execution of Mr. Majid Qasemi and four other
    individuals has been taken from the websites of Iran newspaper (Aug. 28,
    Sep. 28 & 30, 2002), Amnesty International (Sep. 25), the Jomhuri Eslami
    newspaper (Sep. 27), and the ISNA news agency (Sep. 29). According to Iran
    , these five men kidnapped young women and raped them; the sixth member of
    this gang called “Unveiled Hunters” (or “Black Vultures” in Amnesty
    International’s report, established in June/July 2001), not proven guilty
    of rape, was charged with kidnapping and consumption of alcohol and
    condemned to flogging and 25 years imprisonment. The judge of Tehran
    Judiciary stated that “according to the law, the details of the activities
    of this gang cannot be disclosed…” He denied the allegation that the
    victims of the gang were, in fact, prostitutes and added: “fading of
    spiritual values, the type of make-up and inappropriate appearance of some
    women provoke some youth and hence bring about certain difficulties… The
    Judiciary and the police will sternly prosecute the seditious and will not
    show any consideration in their prosecution” ( Jomhuri Eslami ). Arrest
    and detention Following the complaint of a young woman regarding the
    kidnapping of her sister and her friend, the members of this gang were
    arrested on December 30, 2001 ( Iran ). The details of this defendant’s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant’s trial other than it took place at Branch 1610 of the
    Tehran Judiciary (Amnesty International). Charges Mr. Qasemi was charged
    with “rape, kidnapping, theft, and consumption of alcohol” ( Iran ). The
    newspaper wrote that the gang members, under the cover of taxi cab
    drivers, kidnapped women, stole their valuables, and raped them. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The exact number of the victims of the gang was not announced but it was
    mentioned that the file included ten victims ( Jomhuri Eslami ). The Judge
    stated that when the media publicized the story, many people wrote to one
    of the newspapers and complained about the gang. After opening a telephone
    hot-line for the victims of the gang, 17 tapes of phone calls were
    recorded, totaling 30 hours ( ibid ). According to the Iran newspaper,
    four of the victims of the gang testified against the defendants at court.
    The newspaper report also referred to identification of the victims by the
    police, and communications of many women, who did not wish to come forward
    for the sake of their honor. Additionally, having heard the testimony of
    the witnesses, the defendants expressed regret and confessed to having
    committed the crimes. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Qasemi’s defense at the court. However,
    three of the defendants spoke to the media before their execution. Mr.
    Majid Qasemi, said: “we do not deserve to be executed. The [women] who
    filed complaints against us did not resist our demands.” Another
    defendant, named Amir Karbala’i Heidar, stated that he was innocent and
    that the targeted women were prostitutes and he did not understand why
    they filed complaints against the defendants. When asked why, as a
    student, he committed such acts, Payam Amini, another co-defendant,
    responded, “I accept that I had infringed the law and am ready to be
    punished for that, but our crime was not such to be punishable by death…”
    Judgment The court condemned the defendants to death and Branch 32 of the
    Supreme Court approved the death sentence. According to ISNA, each of the
    individuals was flogged 154 lashes before the execution. The three young
    men waved at their friends from inside the police vehicle that brought
    them to the execution location. They hugged each other and one of them
    “angrily objected to the journalists and reporters” ( Iran ). The judge
    asserted: “The strict execution of God’s punishment will continue.
