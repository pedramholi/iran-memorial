    News of the execution of Mr. Nur Mohammad Taheri Rad, son of Ali, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on May 9, 2002. Arrest and Detention There
    is no specific information on Mr. Taheri Rad s arrest and detention. Trial
    No information is available on Mr. Taheri Rad s trial. Charges The charge
    against Mr. Taheri Rad was announced as murder. He was accused of
    murdering two individuals in Beidokht near Gonabad during a fight in April
    of 2000. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of
    this execution did not provide any specific information on the evidence
    presented against Mr. Taheri Rad. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Taheri Rad's defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Nur Mohammad
    Taheri Rad to death. The ruling was carried out in the presence of the
    victims family at the Police Headquarters in Gonabad on May 8, 2002.
