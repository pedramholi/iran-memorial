    News of the execution of Mr. Sha ban ali was published in the Iran
    newspaper on May 29, 2002. Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Sha ban ali s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch Three of
    the Malayer Courthouse tried Mr. Sha ban ali. No information is available
    on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Sha ban ali was
    announced as murder . He was accused of shooting his wife and
    brother-in-law to death on January 15, 2002. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence presented against Mr. Sha ban ali was his confession. According
    to the report, the victims were attacked by Mr. Sha ban ali on the day his
    wife was following up on their divorce case around Emamzadeh Abdollah
    Square. His brother-in-law was shot and killed in the street and his wife
    died in a barrage of gunfire after she escaped to the Emamzadeh Abdollah
    Shrine. An elderly passerby was also shot during this incident.
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. Defense No information is available on Mr. Sha ban ali s
    defense. Judgment Branch Three of the Malayer Courthouse condemned Mr. Sha
    ban ali to death and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged
    in public at the Emamzadeh Abdollah Square in Malayer on May 27, 2002.
