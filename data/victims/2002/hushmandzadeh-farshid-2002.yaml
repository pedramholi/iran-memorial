    News of the execution of Mr. Farshid Hushmandzadeh, along with three
    others, was published in the Iran newspaper on May 16, 2002. Arrest and
    Detention Mr. Hushmandzadeh was detained at least since 1998. There is no
    specific information on his arrest and detention. Trial No information is
    available on Mr. Hushmandzadeh s trial. Charges The charge against Mr.
    Hushmandzadeh was announced as "murder." The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution did not
    provide any specific information on the evidence presented against Mr.
    Hushmandzadeh. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hushmandzadeh s
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Farshid Hushmandzadeh to death
    on May 9, 1998. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged at
    the Qasr Prison yard in Tehran on May 15, 2002.
