    News of the execution of Mr. Abbas Ali, without the last name, was
    published in the Qods newspaper on June 27, 2002. Arrest and detention
    Agents of Branch One of the Intelligence Police in Mashhad arrested Mr.
    Abbas Ali in Mashhad in May of 2001 when they were investigating the
    recovery of the body of a 36-year-old man. The circumstances of his arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial Branch 53 of the Public Court in
    Mashhad tried Mr. Abbas Ali in several sessions. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges The charge brought against Mr. Abbas Ali
    was announced as premeditated murder of his friend, Aliakbar Hosseinzadeh.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Abbas Ali was his confession, the confession of the victim s wife, and the
    police report. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Abbas Ali s defense. Judgment Branch 53 of the Public Court in Mashhad
    condemned Mr. Abbas Ali to death for murder, to 99 lashes for acts
    incompatible with chastity, and to 80 lashes for drinking alcoholic
    beverages. Branch 41 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was
    hanged in the presence of judicial and security officials at the Mashhad
    Central Prison yard on June 24, 2002. No further information is available
    about his execution. The court also condemned Ms. Najmeh, the victim s
    wife, to 10 years imprisonment for assisting in murder and 99 lashes for
    acts incompatible with chastity.
