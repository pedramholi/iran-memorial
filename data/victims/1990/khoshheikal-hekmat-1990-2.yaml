    Information about Mr. Hekmat Khoshheikal has been drawn from an interview
    with an individual familiar with this case. He was affiliated with the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI). Having graduated from high
    school, he started his compulsory military service. The Kurdish Democratic
    Party of Iran (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with the objective to gain
    autonomy for Kurdistan, in north-west of Iran. After the Revolution,
    conflicts between the new central Shiite government and the mainly Sunni
    Kurdistan, regarding the role of minorities in the drafting of the
    constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and
    particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in armed clashes between
    the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The
    PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, when people went to polls to
    vote for or against the Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979 Ayatollah
    Khomeini called the PDKI the “party of Satan” and declared it “unofficial
    and illegal.” Mass executions and fighting broke out and continued for
    several months in the region. By 1983, PDKI had lost much of its influence
    in the region. Various leaders of the PDKI have been assassinated. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Khoshheikal was arrested on August 19, 1989 at the Paveh
    Garrison (Kermanshah province) where he was serving his military service.
    He was detained at the Intelligence Unit of the Revolutionary Guards Corps
    in Kermanshah. His family visited the Revolutionary Guards base to receive
    some information about him. One day, as they were talking to a guard, they
    saw Mr. Khoshheikal still in uniform and with handcuffs and tied feet. He
    said that he was being taken to the court. A guard warned them against
    speaking Kurdish and said they should only speak in Farsi. This was his
    only visit with his family during the 7 months of detention. After this
    visit, the family’s attempts for another visit remained ineffective. Trial
    There is no information regarding this trial. Charges The charges brought
    against the defendant are not known. Evidence of guilt No information is
    available concerning the evidence presented against the accused. Defense
    No information is available concerning Khoshheikal’s defense. He was
    denied the right to an attorney or access to his file. Judgment On March
    19, 1990 the authorities informed Mr. Hekmat Khoshheikal’s family that he
    had been executed in Kermanshah. With lots of persistence, his family was
    eventually allowed to bring the body from Kermanshah to Paveh. They found
    out that the body had not been buried and merely thrown into a ditch. His
    family was warned against talking about this incident to anyone. They were
    later exiled from Paveh to Kermanshah.
