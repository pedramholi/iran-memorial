    Information regarding Ms. Tayebeh Hayati, executed along with Ms. Zohreh
    Jamshidi, was obtained through an interview with a person close to her.
    Ms. Hayati, daughter of Mahmud, was born in September 1963 in Tehran. She
    was first arrested in June 1982 when she was a school girl and a
    sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. After undergoing harsh
    torture, traces of which could be found on her body and feet after her
    release, she was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment. She was detained
    first at Evin Prison and since 1984 at Qezelhesar prison. Her family was
    only allowed to visit her after a year and a half. She was released in
    1987 but later decided to leave the country, as did other sympathizers of
    the Mojahedin. Arrest and detention Ms. Hayati was arrested in May 1990 at
    the domestic lines section of a Tehran bus terminal as she was going to
    start her journey out of Iran. During the two months of her detention, she
    was kept incommunicado and was denied an attorney. No precise information
    is available on the location of detention, but since her family was
    informed of her execution by Evin prison authorities, she is likely to
    have been held at that prison. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges Charges brought against Ms. Hayati are unknown.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Ms. Hayati s defense. Judgment Ms. Tayebeh
    Hayati was executed at Evin Prison on July 16, 1990. According to people
    close to her, her family was contacted by prison officials and told to
    bring her a change of clothes. When the family checked in the prison,
    however, they were told that she had been executed. Her body was not
    released to her family and to this day her parents do not know where she
    might have been buried. They heard from the families of other inmates that
    Tayebeh, being a young woman, was raped by prison officials before
    execution. They also heard that she had been kept in section 5 of Evin
    Prison, where inmates were not allowed to receive any visitors.
