    The execution of Mr. Baluch Esma'ilzehi was annouced in February 17th,
    1990 by the newspaper Jomhuri Eslami and reported in the United Nations'
    report on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
    A/45/697, 6 November 1990. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. A 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts (5 kg of hashish or
    opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone) of
    proscribed narcotics has been used to sentence thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers to death, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. However it has been reported to the
    United Nations' special representative, that at the time of this execution
    : "trials before Islamic revolutionary Courts have usually taken place in
    secret, sometimes inside prisons, that defendants have not usually enjoyed
    the right to be represented by a lawyer, and often have not even been made
    aware that the proceedings were in fact a trial and not an interrogation
    session." Charges The defendant was charged with drug trafficking Evidence
    of guilt The report of this execution does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on this person's defense. Judgment No information
    is available about the sentence and the mode of execution.
