  - "That trials before Islamic revolutionary courts have usually taken place in secret, sometimes inside prisons; that defendants have not usually enjoyed the right to be represented by a lawyer, and often have not even been made aware that the proceedings were in fact a trial and not an interrogation session."

    The execution of Mr. Ali-Nazar Mohammad-Samdani was acknowledged in a list
    provided to the Special representative of the United Nation's Commission
    on Human Rights, Professor Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, by the Government of
    Iran This list was published in a 1990 Report of the Economic and Social
    Council of the United Nations on The Situation of Human Rights in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran. A/45/697. International human rights
    organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic
    Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. A 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on
    drug traffickers found in possession of specified amounts (5 kg of hashish
    or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone) of
    proscribed narcotics has been used to sentence thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers to death, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention No information is
    available on the defendant’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. However, it has been reported to the
    special representative: "That trials before Islamic revolutionary courts
    have usually taken place in secret, sometimes inside prisons; that
    defendants have not usually enjoyed the right to be represented by a
    lawyer, and often have not even been made aware that the proceedings were
    in fact a trial and not an interrogation session.". Charges Mr.
    Mohammad-Samdani was accused of "drug trafficking." Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mohammad-Samdani's defense. Judgment No further
    information is available on the verdict and the execution .
