    took the fall to secure the release of his newly-married brother. News and
    information about the execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Esma ili Bolurdi, son
    of Khanomjan and Ziadkhan, along with 14 other people was obtained through
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center interviews with one of his acquaintances on
    June 22, 2018. Mr. Esma ili was born in 1961 in Sirjan County in Kerman
    province. He left school before receiving his high school diploma and
    started working as a truck driver. He was married with two children.
    According to an acquaintance, he was a kind, decent, and religious person.
    Mr. Esma ili s case pertained to drug trafficking in 1986 in Sirjan
    County. Mr. Esma ili was a kind, decent, and religious person. Arrest and
    detention In late December 1986-early January 1987, around 7 PM, about
    eight agents of the Khalili Komiteh in Shiraz (Center for Combating
    Narcotics and Social Corruption) arrested Mr. Esma ili and his brother at
    Mr. Esma ili's home in Sirjan and transferred him to the Khalili Komiteh
    in Shiraz. During his detention at Khalili Komiteh, Mr. Esma ili s family
    was allowed to visit him just once. According to the interviewee, during
    this time, Mr. Esma ili was severely tortured and signs of whipping on his
    back and one broken tooth were obviously visible. After a while, he was
    transferred to Adelabad Prison in Shiraz. During four years of detention
    in Adelabad Prison, he was allowed to visit his family once a week. His
    family was forced to travel 377 kilometers between Sirjan and Shiraz every
    week for visitation. Mr. Esma ili was severely tortured and signs of
    whipping on his back and one broken tooth were obviously visible. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Esma ili s trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Esma ili was drug trafficking. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt Confessions made by an individual who was
    arrested for drug trafficking against Mr. Esma ili and 14 others were used
    as the evidence to prove Mr. Esma ili s charge. According to the available
    information, the person who made the confession (first row defendant)
    identified several people as his accomplices, thinking that he would be
    punished less with accomplices in the case. Confessions made by an
    individual who was arrested for drug trafficking against Mr. Esma ili and
    14 others were used as the evidence to prove Mr. Esma ili s charge.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Esma ili s defense. According
    to available information, there was no evidence against Mr. Esma ili to
    prove the charge of drug trafficking, other than the confession of the
    arrested person (the prime defendant). This came at a time when Mr. Esma
    ili had no criminal record, was not addicted to drugs, and no drugs were
    discovered in his home. Even the person who confessed against him
    retracted his confession several times, though the interrogators tortured
    that person into finally affirming the confession. According to the
    interviewee, Mr. Esma ili accepted the alleged charge in order to secure
    release of his brother, who had recently married. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. There
    was no evidence against Mr. Esma ili to prove the charge of drug
    trafficking. Judgment Mr. Mohammad Ali Esma ili Bolurdi was hanged in
    Adelabad Prison in Shiraz along with 14 others on May 12, 1990. There is
    no information on the court that issued the execution verdict against Mr.
    Esma ili. Before Mr. Esma ili s execution, his wife, along with the
    several other defendants wives, had travelled to the office of Iran s
    Supreme Leader in Tehran to follow up on their loved ones cases, but
    nothing happened. The prison authorities did not provide Mr. Esma ili or
    his family with an execution date. The family was informed about the
    execution only afterwards and was asked to report to Adelabad Prison to
    receive his body. Mr. Esma ili s family received his body along with four
    others, and transferred them to Sirjan with a pickup truck and buried them
    there. According to the interviewee, some sources reported that the rope
    tore during Mr. Esma ili s execution and authorities afterward hanged him
    a second time. Two booklets containing Mr. Esma ili s poems and account of
    his detention remain.
