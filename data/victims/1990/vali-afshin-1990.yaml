    Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Afshin Vali, son of
    Farangis Foroughi Arani and Ebadollah, was obtained from the report and
    interview of his brother, Mr. Payam Vali, with Radio Zamaneh Farzad
    Seifikaran (June 16, 2021) and Facebook (June 26, 2022). Mr. Vali was 12
    years old and he was born into a Baha i family. He lived in the village of
    Hossein Abad, near the town of Nazar Abad, in Fars Province. He was in
    seventh grade. According to his brother, He was an excellent student and
    his GPA was always perfect. (Radio Zamaneh) Mr. Vali s family were
    repeatedly threatened by the leader of Friday Prayers and by the people of
    their village, because of their Baha i beliefs. In 1986, when his family
    moved from Nazar Abad to the village of Hossein Abad, and started to build
    a house, they were subjected to pressure. A Moslem youth from that village
    demolished the walls of this house several times at night. One time, while
    he was tearing down the wall, this young man was arrested: The youth whose
    name was Asghar told my brother, We will not let more Baha is move to our
    village to cast a spell on us and pollute our village . (Radio Zamaneh)
    Another time, in 1989, this young man tried to kidnap Mr. Vali s sister,
    but he was recognized during this crime. Her father complained to the
    Nazar Abad Police station. However, after the people of the village
    attempted to mediate and the young man formally apologized to her parents,
    the father withdrew his complaint. In the early spring of 1990, the Leader
    of Friday Prayers in the village of Hossein Abad gave a lecture against
    Baha is during the Friday Prayers. His brother says, Some of my friends
    gathered around me and told me that the cleric had said shedding the blood
    of Baha is is allowed, and if someone kills a Baha i all his sins will be
    forgiven and he will go to heaven. These few sentences had a profound
    effect on me and settled in my mind. I have never forgotten. (Radio
    Zamaneh) The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the
    Baha i threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national
    security in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Mr. Afshin
    Vali s Death According to available information, on Saturday, June 9,
    1990, while he was playing in the village, Mr. Vali was killed by a severe
    blow to the head. The killers threw his body in a qanat well in the
    village of Hossein Abad. His brother talked about that event: We were
    playing in the village. After a while, I separated from Afshin and went to
    another area to play. When I got home, I realized Afshin was not home yet.
    My mother, brother, sister, and I looked for him all over the village for
    5 hours, but we did not find a trace. He says, I don t know what possessed
    me to go to that well. When I got there, I saw Afshin s toy on the water.
    The well was about 5 meters deep, and the water had risen about two and a
    half meters. I didn t see the body, but as soon as I saw the toy, I ran
    home. With great difficulty I was able to point out the direction of the
    well to my older brother. When they went there they found the body in the
    well, and they were able to take it out with the help of the neighbors.
    (Radio Zamaneh) They took Mr. Vali s body to the Coroner s office: At the
    coroner s office, they verbally told the father that Afshin had not
    swallowed even one drop of water, and that he had not drowned. However,
    they could see the signs of a heavy blow to the head, indicating he had
    died before falling into the water. (Radio Zamaneh) On June 10, 1990, Mr.
