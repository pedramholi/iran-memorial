circumstances: >
    The information about the execution of this woman was related in the
    November 1990 United Nations' report on the situation of human rights in
    the Islamic Republic of Iran. The report refers to the January 16th news
    wire from Agence France Press quoting the Iranian press about this
    execution The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. However it has been reported to the
    United Nations' special representative, that at the time of this execution
    : "trials before Islamic revolutionary Courts have usually taken place in
    secret, sometimes inside prisons, that defendants have not usually enjoyed
    the right to be represented by a lawyer, and often have not even been made
    aware that the proceedings were in fact a trial and not an interrogation
    session." Charges The defendant was charged with "prostitution". Evidence
    of guilt The report of this execution does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on this person's defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Bandar Anzali found the defendant guilty and
    sentenced her to death by stoning. Article 104 of the Islamic Republic's
    Penal Code states that ''...the stones should not be too large so that the
    person dies on being hit by one or two of them...'' and is designed to
    cause grievous pain leading to eventual death. The exact date of this
    execution is not known.
