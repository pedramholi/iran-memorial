    Boroumand Center (ABC) interviews with Mrs. Homa Shahsavaripur (one of Mr.
    Eskandarzadeh s codefendants child) on May 15, September 25, and October
    11, 2018, ABC interviews with Mr. Reza Shahsavaripur (one of Mr.

    of Mr. Eskandarzadeh s codefendants) on June 25, 2018, and ABC interview
    with a relative of Mr. Mohammad Ali Esma ili Bolurdi (another codefendant
    of Mr. Eskandarzadeh). Mr. Eskandarzadeh was born on 1958. He was married
    with two children. Mr. Eskandarzadeh was 32 years old at the time of
    execution. Mr. Eskandarzadeh s case pertained to drug related offences in
    1986 in Sirjan County. At the time of execution, Mr. Eskandarzadeh was 32
    years old, married with two children. Arrest and detention In late October
    1986-early November 1986, agents of the Khalili Komiteh in Shiraz (Center
    for Combating Narcotics and Social Corruption) arrested Mr. Eskandarzadeh
    (ABC interview with one of Mr. Keivan s acquaintances). After some months,
    he was transferred to Adelabad Prison in Shiraz and was held there for
    about four years until the execution date (ABC interview with Mr. Reza
    Shahsavaripur). The circumstances of Mr. Eskandarzadeh s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial Branch Six of the Office of the Assistant
    Public Prosecutor in Shiraz conducted initial investigations in the case
    of Mr. Eskandarzadeh and other codefendants in this case. Then the case
    was sent to the Sharia Judge of the Revolutionary Court in Shiraz (ABC
    interview with Mr. Reza Shahsavaripur). The last trial session was held in
    1989. No information is available on the exact date and details of Mr.
    Eskandarzadeh s trial sessions. Charges According to interviewees, the
    charge brought against Mr. Eskandarzadeh was drug trafficking. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against these defendants cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Mr. Eskandarzadeh s body was buried in Sirjan County
    in Kerman province along with four other codefendants in his case.
