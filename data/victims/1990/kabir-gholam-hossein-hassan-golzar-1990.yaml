    News and information regarding the execution of Mr. Gholamhossein (also
    known as Hassan) Golzar Kabir, son of Nadali, and two other individuals
    was obtained from the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interviews conducted
    with an eyewitness and a person with knowledge of the case (March 20,
    2015, and January 29, 2021). News of this execution was also published in
    Jomhuri-e Eslami (February 13 to 17, 1990) and Kayhan (February 15, 1990)
    newspapers. News of Mr. Golzar Kabir s execution was also published in the
    United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran s report (November 6, 1990). A book entitled
    Ghahremani Ke Nashenakhteh Mand ( The Hero Who Remained Unknown ), written
    by Hamid Moghimi, was also published about this case, describing and
    telling the story of these cases (March-April 1999). Payam-e Ayandeh
    website has also published the news of this execution (February 7, 2013).
    Mr. Golzar Kabir was married, with children, and was born and resided in
    the city of Hamedan. He was a former employee of the Hamedan Municipality
    (having been fired) and ran a sheep s head and trotters store with his
    brother in that city. Mr. Golzar Kabir s case, and that of two other
    individuals, is related to murder and armed robbery at Keshavarzi Bank
    located at Hamedan s Aramgah Square in the morning of February 11, 1990.
    Arrest and detention Mr. Golzar Kabir was arrested by Bushehr Province
    Criminal Investigations Bureau detectives on February 13, 1990, at her
    sister s home in [the town of] Borazjan, and was transferred by airplane
    first to Tehran and then to Hamedan. He spent three days in detention.
    According to available information, following a robbery at Hamedan s
    Keshavarzi Bank, Mr. Reza Khanian went to one of his relatives home and
    asked to entrust him with a certain sum of money. Since news of the
    robbery had spread throughout the city, Mr. Khanian s relative became
    suspicious and alerted the police. Initially, Mr. Khanian, and
    subsequently Mr. Golzar Kabir s brother, were arrested. They confessed [to
    the commission of crimes] and pointed to Mr. Golzar Kabir as the third
    individual involved [in the robbery]. The police printed Mr. Golzar Kabir
    s photograph and personal characteristics and dispatched them to Criminal
    Investigations Bureaus in provinces where they suspected he might be
    [hiding]. According to the Chief of the Islamic Republic Police Force, who
    was in Hamedan representing the Minister of the Interior, Nine other
    individuals have been arrested in connection with the theft of 150 million
    Rials from this bank, and their cases are being investigated . (Jomhuri-e
    Eslami newspaper, February 17, 1990). The Bank Keshavarzi assistant
    manager who was in [the city of] Malayer at the time of the incident was
    among those who were arrested. Hamedan Information Administration had
    hidden the detainees family and close relatives in a safe place for fear
    of violence against them stemming from the people s anger, and would not
    let them show themselves in the city. (A source with knowledge of the
    case). Trial The day after these individuals arrest, that is, on February
    14, 1990, Hamedan Criminal Court One, conducted a public trial of Mr.
    Golzar Kabir and two other defendants at the Hamedan Judiciary, with a
    single judge (Shari a Judge) on the bench and with his secretary present.
    The Supreme Leader s representative in Hamedan, Hamedan s Friday Prayer
    Imam, Hamedan Province Governor, and a number of other officials were also
    present at trial. Mr. Golzar Kabir and the other two defendants had a
    court-appointed attorney. A judicial delegation was dispatched to Hamedan
    by the then-Head of the Judiciary Branch in order to supervise and oversee
    the proceedings, even though the trial had convened less than 48 hours
    after the events. (Kayhan newspaper, February 15, 1990). Charges The
    charges brought against Mr. Golzar Kabir were stated to have been robbery,
    carrying out a Haram ( forbidden by Islam ) act ([in this instance,] the
    act of entering someone s home while that person is in her sleeping
    quarters and a Namahram ( stranger , not among the intimate few allowed by
    Islam) sees her), stabbing the murder victim in the body with a knife, and
    committing intentional murder . (Jomhuri-e Eslami newspaper, February 17,
    1990). According to available information, Mr. Golzar Kabir and two other
    individuals had broken into the Bank Keshavarzi at 1:30 in the morning of
    February 11, 1990, in order to rob the bank. They stole 150 million Rials
    from the bank s safe and fled after killing the head of the bank, his
    spouse and two children (all of whom lived there), and the bank guard. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug tr
