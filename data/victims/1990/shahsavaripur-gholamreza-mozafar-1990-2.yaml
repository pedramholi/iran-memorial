    was imprisoned for four years and finally executed based only on the false
    confession of an accused person during the interrogation. Information
    about the execution of Mr. Gholamreza (Mozafar) Shahsavaripur, son of
    Mahtal at and Haji Esma il, along with 14 people was obtained through the
    electronic form sent to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center on October 21,
    2012, Abdorrahman Boroumand Center interviews with his children (Reza and
    Homa), and documents available from the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center
    including Mr. Shahsavaripur s death certificate. Mr. Gholamreza
    Shahsavaripur, nicknamed Mozafar, was born on April 28, 1944 in a nomadic
    tribe in Sirjan County in Kerman province. He had a primary school level
    education, he liked reading, and he wrote beautifully in calligraphy. He
    was a farmer who tended livestock, as well as a truck driver. Mr.
    Shahsavaripur was married with three children. His children remember him
    as a kind, merciful, self-made, hopeful, and hardworking father with a
    good taste in clothes. He was a religious person and he was known for his
    opposition to the Islamic Republic in Iran. Mr. Shahsavaripur s case was
    related to drug trafficking. Arrest and detention In late 1986-early 1987,
    agents of the Khalili Komiteh in Shiraz (Center for Combating Narcotics
    and Social Corruption) along with the agents of the Sirjan Drug Control
    Headquarters arrested Mr. Shahsavaripur at his home in Sirjan and
    transferred him to the Khalili Komiteh in Shiraz. According to the
    interviewees, around 10 PM, about eight agents of the Khalili Komiteh
    entered Mr. Shahsavaripur s home by jumping over the wall and arrested Mr.
    Shahsavaripur while beating him in front of his family. The agents
    arrested Mr. Shahsavaripur without a warrant and seized much of his
    property and household belongings, including family photo albums. Mr.
    Shahsavaripur was interrogated for seven months by the Khalili Komiteh in
    Shiraz. During this time, he was severely tortured - including with
    whipping on the soles of his feet, violent beatings, and the use of
    abusive words - and denied the right to contact and visit with his family.
    Mr. Shahsavaripur did not have access to a lawyer at all stages of the
    proceedings. After seven months of detention, Mr. Shahsavaripur met his
    family in the court yard. At this meeting, he talked with his family about
    the reason for his arrest and what happened during his detention at
    Khalili Komiteh, and showed them the signs of torture on his body. After
    the trial, Mr. Shahsavaripur was transferred to Adelabad Prison in Shiraz
    and was held there for about four years until the execution date. During
    this time, Mr. Shahsavaripur s family - his wife and three children - were
    forced to travel 377 kilometers between Sirjan and Shiraz every week for
    visitation. His last visit was about a week before the execution, at a
    time when no one knew that it would be the last meeting. Mr. Shahsavaripur
    was interrogated for seven months by the Khalili Komiteh in Shiraz. During
    this time, he was severely tortured, denied the right to contact and visit
    with his family, and did not have access to a lawyer. Prior to execution,
    Mr. Shahsavaripur was held in the penitentiary facility at Adelabad Prison
    (customarily used to house prisoners in the hours immediately before their
    execution) in Shiraz for 15 days. An inmate should be transferred to such
    a facility only in the final hours prior to execution: holding prisoners
    in this place for a long time is intolerable and is considered to be
    torture. According to available information, two months before Mr.
    Shahsavaripur s arrest, the agents attempted to arrest him at his home,
    but since Mr. Shahsavaripur was not home at the time, the agents were not
    able to arrest him. After that, at the suggestion of his family members,
    Mr. Shahsavaripur did not return to his home for some time. After two
    months, however, he returned home because he believed that he had not
    committed any offenses, and was arrested shortly thereafter. Trial Branch
    Six of the Office of the Assistant Public Prosecutor in Shiraz conducted
    initial investigations in the case of Mr. Shahsavaripur. About seven
    months after Mr. Shahsavaripur s arrest, his case was completed and sent
    to the Sharia Judge of the Revolutionary Court in Shiraz, and the Sharia
    Judge tried him in one session. There is no information available on the
    exact date and details of the trial. Mr. Shahsavaripur had shown the signs
    of torture on his body to the judge, but the judge did not heed him.
    According to the interviewees, Mr. Shahsavaripur had shown the signs of
    torture on his body to the judge, but the judge did not heed him. Charges
    The charge brought against Mr. Shahsavaripur was drug trafficking. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
