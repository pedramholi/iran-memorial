    The information about Mr. Siamak Tuba’i was drawn from an interview with a
    person familiar with his case, as well as from the book Neither Life nor
    Death, Vol. 4: Till The Dawn of Grapes by Iraj Mesdaghi (Memoirs of Prison
    1981-1991) published in Stockholm in 2004. In this book, Mr. Mesdaghi, a
    cellmate and close friend of Mr. Tuba’i in 1988/89, during the last year
    of his life, narrates his conversations with the latter and provides
    valuable information about him. Mr. Siamak Tuba’i was born in Tehran. At
    the time of his arrest, he was in the 12th grade at Kharazmi High School.
    According to Mr. Mesdaghi, in high school, “he did martial arts [and] had
    a relatively well-built body.” He coached some of his classmates in an
    exercise group at school. He was a sympathizer of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization (MKO), attended their meetings, and distributed flyers and
    newspapers for them until his father found out and prevented him from
    continuing his political activities. Arrest and detention Mr. Tuba’i was
    arrested in Tehran on September 5, 1981 as he was walking home. The
    Islamic Association of his high school had identified him for his previous
    political activities and reported him to the authorities. Initially he was
    kept at Evin prison incommunicado, where he was interrogated and tortured.
    According to a former cellmate, his feet were swollen as a result of
    bastinado. In October 1981, the Iranian media reported his execution based
    on a communiqué of the Central Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office
    that listed the names of executed prisoners. When his family pursued the
    matter, it was determined that his name was mistakenly announced. The
    authorities eventually sentenced Mr. Tuba’i to imprisonment and
    transferred him to Qezelhesar prison for a short while; however they sent
    him back to Evin around January 1982 to be retried and resentenced. He was
    then returned to Qezelhesar where he had his first visitation in February
    1982. Until later in 1982, he had monthly visits at the same prison.
    Generally, such visitations lasted 10 minutes in the presence of prison
    guards. Communication with prisoners was through a telephone from behind a
    glass divider. In late 1982, the authorities transferred Mr. Tuba’i to
    Gohardasht Prison where, according to his cellmate, he was in solitary
    confinement for two years. Between 1983 and 1988, he had visitors every
    three weeks, on and off. From July to October 1988, during the mass
    execution of political prisoners throughout the country, all Gohardasht
    political prisoners were denied visitation. In February 1989, Mr. Tuba’i
    and other survivors of this massacre were transferred to Evin Prison where
    he spent his last year and had visits every two weeks. In 1989, Mr. Tuba’i
    was given temporary leave of absence from prison three times, ranging from
    a few hours to a few days. During his third leave, he attempted to escape
    but he was arrested. No information is available about the circumstances
    of his detention after this second arrest: Those familiar with his case
    suspect that he may have been interrogated and tortured again. Trial
    Following his arrest in 1981, he was tried and sentenced to three years
    imprisonment. However, after one of his friends from Kharazmi High School
    was arrested, Mr. Tuba’i was returned to Evin prison, where he was
    retried. Based on Mr. Tuba’i’s own account, this friend (who was executed
    in January 1982) had heard the news of the execution of Mr. Tuba’i from
    the media in October 1981 and had decided to name him as his supervisor
    under torture. The religious judge confronted Mr. Tuba’i and his friend in
    a court session. After this friend realized that Mr. Tuba’i was alive, he
    retracted his confession and stressed that he had lied and that his
    statement about him was baseless. Nevertheless, the judge retried Mr.
    Tuba’i and sentenced him to 12 years imprisonment. The exact date of the
    second trial is not known but most probably it took place in January 1982.
    Whether or not there was a third trial following the October 1989 leave is
    not known. Charges The authorities did not officially inform the family of
    the charges against Mr. Tuba’i. However, in 1984, when Mr. Tuba’i’s family
    went to the office established by Ayatollah Montazeri to address
    prisoners’ relatives’ queries, they were told that Mr. Tuba’i’s sentence
    was increased from 3 to 12 years because he was an MKO sympathizer at
    Kharazmi High School and had organized an exercise sports group at school.
    The authorities also noted that “he had lied during his first trial and
    had not been cooperative.” “He is too stubborn and must change”, they
    added. The Iranian authorities have denied detaining Mr. Tuba’i after his
    attempted escape and have not provided information regarding the charges
    against him. Evidence of guilt No information is available regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available about Mr. Tuba’i’s defense. Based on the available information,
