    Ms. Qazi, daughter of Qazi Muhammad, the president of the short-lived
    Kurdish Republic of Mahabad, a self-autonomous Kurdish state in
    northwestern Iran in 1946, was killed in 1990 by a letter bomb in V ster
    s, Sweden, intended for her husband. Information regarding the life and
    extra-judicial execution of Ms. Effat Qazi, born in 1935 in Mahabad,
    Kurdistan Province and mother of two, has been obtained through
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights (ABC) interviews conducted
    with Mr. Amir Qazi (October 30, 2021) and a relative (October 16, 2022);
    Swedish newspapers Dagens Nyheter (October 3, 1990, September 8, 9, 11,
    12, 23, November 8, 28, 1990, January 21, 22, 1993, October 20, 2001);
    Svenska Dagbladet (September 8, 18, 23, 1990); Expressen (29 September,
    2003); Flamman (February 17, 2020); the Swedish documentary
    Terrorkommandot (released in 2002); and I nationens intresse (released in
    2003); Interview with Ms. Effat Qazi s husband Mr. Amir Qazi by Swedish
    journalist Erik Hj rtberg published on his website erikhjartberg.se (March
    4, 2020); and Swedish podcast Ol sta Mord: Brevbombsmordet (April 5,
    2020). Ms. Ghazi, daughter of Qazi Muhammad, the president of the
    short-lived Kurdish Republic of Mahabad, a self-autonomous Kurdish state
    in northwestern Iran in 1946, grew up without her father as he was
    executed in 1947. [1] The entire family went through significant hardship
    and their property was confiscated at the time of the execution of her
    father (ABC interview with Mr. Amir Qazi, October 30, 2021). Ms. Qazi
    studied political science at Tehran University and worked at the
    Department of Culture after graduating in 1971. She married Mr. Amir Qazi
    when they were university students, and they had two daughters. According
    to her husband, she focused on raising them with a strong sense of their
    Kurdish identity. While Ms. Qazi had been an active member of the youth
    committee of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), founded by
    her father when she was young, she did not participate in the
    organizational work of the party as an adult. Her husband, Mr. Amir Qazi,
    was an active member of the party s leadership, which endangered his
    safety and led him into exile to Sweden in 1972. Mr. Qazi returned to Iran
    after the Revolution and, as tensions rose between the Kurdish parties and
    the revolutionary government over the rights of the Kurds and the
    political future of the country, he participated in the Kurdish parties
    armed struggle that opposed the central government, which began in
    mid-1979. Ms. Qazi lived apart from her husband for years, after he was
    forced to leave Iran and returned to Sweden. She moved to Sweden in 1986
    with her daughters, took Swedish classes and became a teacher, which she
    loved. Her husband describes her as a brave and devoted wife and mother
    (ABC interview with Mr. Amir Qazi, October 30, 2021). The Kurdish Problem
    in the Islamic Republic After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the
    disagreements between the government of the Shiite Islamic Republic and
    the organizations in the Kurdish regions of western Iran regarding the
    rights and roles of minorities in drafting the Constitution; whether the
    government should be secular or religious, and especially the issue of
    Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in Kurdish political
    organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on instituting an
    Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed, clashes between the
    central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan Democratic Party s armed
    forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini labeled the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and most influential Kurdish
    Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it unofficial and illegal and
    ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass executions and intense armed
    clashes continued in the region for months, clashes that resulted in the
    deaths of a number of civilians and the displacement and relocation of the
    residents of certain towns. In the next four years, Kurdish parties lost
    their grip on power in the region to a great extent, and relocated to
    Iraqi Kurdistan. Since then, a number of their leaders and members have
    been assassinated outside Iran, especially in Iraqi Kurdistan. [2]
    Background on the Formation of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan
    The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with
    the goal to gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in north-western Iran. After the
    Revolution, conflicts between the new central Shiite government and mainly
    Sunni Kurdistan regarding the role of minorities in the drafting of the
    constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and
    particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in armed clashes between
    the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The
    PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, 1979, when people went to polls
    to vote for or against the Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah
    Khomein
