    had told his family during visitations: I did not commit any crime
    deserving execution. I ll be free. News and information about the
    execution of Mr. Habibollah Keivan, son of Khatun and Asadollah, along
    with 14 other people was obtained through Abdorrahman Boroumand Center
    interviews with one of Mr. Keivan s acquaintances on June 25 and October
    11, 2018. Mr. Keivan was born in 1955 in Sirjan County in Kerman province.
    He finished elementary school and worked as a roadside food stand vendor.
    Mr. Keivan was married and his fourth child was born when he was in
    prison. According to an acquaintance, he was a very kind and good-tempered
    person. Mr. Keivan s case pertained to drug trafficking in 1986 in Sirjan
    County. Mr. Keivan s fourth child was born when he was in prison. Arrest
    and detention In late October 1986-early November 1986, agents of the
    Khalili Komiteh in Shiraz (Center for Combating Narcotics and Social
    Corruption) arrested Mr. Keivan at his home in Sirjan and transferred him
    to the Khalili Komiteh in Shiraz. On the morning of the arrest, while Mr.
    Keivan was having breakfast with his family, two agents of the Khalili
    Komiteh appeared at his home, handcuffed and arrested Mr. Keivan without a
    warrant, and put him in their car and took him away, without allowing him
    even to change his clothes. After a while, Mr. Keivan was transferred to
    Adelabad Prison in Shiraz. He was allowed to work in Adelabad Prison to
    cover his expenses and during this time, he was granted several one-day
    leave periods. During this time, Mr. Keivan was allowed to visit his
    family. However, his family was forced to travel 377 kilometers between
    Sirjan and Shiraz every week for visitation. Since Mr. Keivan s wife was
    faced with severe financial hardship and had no money to pay for travel
    cost between Sirjan and Shiraz, she had to cover the travel cost by
    selling their home appliances. During the four years Mr. Keivan was in
    prison, he continued his education. Mr. Keivan was arrested while he was
    having breakfast with his family, without allowing even to change his
    clothes. Trial No information is available on details of Mr. Keivan s
    trial sessions. The last trial session was held in 1989. Charges The
    charge brought against Mr. Keivan was drug trafficking while carrying a
    weapon. The validity of the criminal charges brought against these
    defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Confessions made by the prime suspect in
    the case against Mr. Keivan, were used as the sole evidence to prove his
    charge. Evidence of guilt According to the interviewee, confessions made
    by the prime suspect in the case against Mr. Keivan were used as the sole
    evidence to prove Mr. Keivan s charge. Defense Mr. Keivan never accepted
    the charge of drug trafficking, and confessed only to his role in
    assisting the prime suspect in the case in burying the drugs on the land
    in front of his home. According to the interviewee, during his detention,
    Mr. Keivan never thought that he would be executed and had told his family
    during visitations: I did not commit any crime deserving execution. I ll
    be free, whether it takes 10 years or 15 years, [eventually] I ll be free.
    According to available information, the evening prior to the arrest, a
    friend of Mr. Keivan asked him to help hide some drugs. Mr. Keivan agreed
    to help his friend. The next morning, Mr. Keivan s friend was arrested
    and, based on his confession, the agents arrested Mr. Keivan. During the
    first years of his detention, Mr. Keivan s charge was assisting and
    participating in drug possession. Conditions of Mr. Keivan s imprisonment
    in those years - including the granting of leave permission and
    opportunities for work in Adelabad Prison - indicate that his charges were
    minor. At the last trial session, which was held about three years after
    Mr. Keivan s arrest, the prime suspect in the case brought a new charge
    against Mr. Keivan. He claimed that Mr. Keivan had accompanied him when he
    was buying drugs in Baluchestan and had carried a weapon during the deal.
    According to the interviewee, those confessions were the basis of issuing
    the final verdict against Mr. Keivan. No information is available on Mr.
    Keivan s defense. Mr. Keivan never accepted the charge of drug
    trafficking. Judgment Mr. Habibollah Keivan was hanged in Adelabad Prison
    in Shiraz along with 14 others on May 12, 1990. There is no information on
    the court that issued the execution verdict against Mr. Keivan. The prison
    authorities did not provide Mr. Keivan or his family with an execution
    date. The family was informed about the execution only afterwards and was
    asked to be present at Adelabad Prison to receive Mr. Keivan s body. Mr.
    Keivan s family received his body
