    Mr. Kashefpur was an honest, patient, kind, and sociable person and
    greatly valued education and the quest for knowledge. Information
    regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Ali Kashefpur, son of Jahangir
    and Nishan, was obtained through an interview conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center with his brother, Mr. Karim Kashani (August 21, 2021);
    Yeni Konya Turkish daily newspaper (August 17, 1990); and the Human Rights
    Center, Konya Branch, Report (August 28, 1990). Additional information
    about his assassination was obtained from the book Yadvareye Ali Kashefpur
    ( In Remembrance of Ali Kashefpur ), (May 1997). Mr. Kashefpur was an
    ethnic Kurd, married, born in 1957-58 in Orumieh s County s village of
    Piranjugh located in the Suma-ye Baradust Region in West Azarbaijan
    province. He studied in the village of Hursin until he finished sixth
    grade, and subsequently went to Orumieh and obtained a high school diploma
    with a concentration in literature. He was then admitted to Tabriz
    University in the social science program. Because of his interest in law
    [and political science], Mr. Kashefpur participated in the national
    college entrance examination again in his second year of college, and was
    accepted into Tehran University s political science program. (Boroumand
    Center interview, August 21, 2021; the book Yadvareye Ali Kashefpur ( In
    Remembrance of Ali Kashefpur ), May 1997). In the last year of his
    university studies, which coincided with the start of the Islamic
    Revolution (1978), Mr. Kashefpur participated in demonstrations and
    protests against the Pahlavi regime, and was beaten several times by
    government forces. After the Islamic Revolution, and upon beginning his
    political activities in Iran s Kurdish regions, he quit school, returned
    to Orumieh, and started a library in the village of Hursin with a group of
    his friends. He then joined the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan and
    began his political and party activities. He was an active member of the
    Party in the northern regions of West Azarbaijan Province. Mr. Kashefpur s
    father, who had been a member of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan
    since the Pahlavi regime, influenced his political and party leanings.
    (Boroumand Center interview, August 21, 2021). Mr. Kashefpur was elected
    adviser to the Party s Central Council at the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan s Fourth Congress held on March 20, 1980, in the city of
    Mahabad. He was severely injured in the summer of 1981, while in Orumieh
    County s village of Aghsaqal, when the central government s fighter jets
    conducted a bombing raid on regions under the control of the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan. From 1982 until 1988, Mr. Kashefpur was
    elected member of the Party s Central Committee in the course of the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan s Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh
    Congresses. From 1982 until 1984, he was active in the Party s Personnel
    and Peshmerga Education Section in the northern regions of West Azarbaijan
    Province. (Boroumand Center interview, August 21, 2021; the book Yadvareye
    Ali Kashefpur , May 1997). After the split in the Democratic Party of
    Iranian Kurdistan in March-April 1988, and the formation of the Democratic
    Party of Iranian Kurdistan-Revolutionary Leadership, he joined the latter
    Party and became a member of its Central Committee. (The book Yadvareye
    Ali Kashefpur , May 1997). He was the main person in charge of the County
    Committees for both the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan and the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan-Revolutionary Leadership, in West
    Azarbaijan Province. (Boroumand Center interview, August 21, 2021). In
    January 1990, Mr. Kashefpur illegally went to Turkey and took up residence
    in the city of Ghunieh (Konya) for seven months in order to help his
    family who was in Turkey at the time and intended to migrate to Europe.
    (Boroumand Center interview, August 21, 2021). He did not feel safe there
    because several members of the Kurdish political parties had been
    assassinated in Turkey during that period, and because he did not trust
    Turkish Police (The book Yadvareye Ali Kashefpur , May 1997); he had also
    introduced himself as an Azeri speaking person. (Human Rights Center,
    Konya Branch, Report, August 28, 1990). According to Mr. Kashefpur s
    brother, he was an honest, patient, kind, and sociable person and greatly
    valued education and the quest for knowledge, and encouraged young people
    around him to get an education. He strongly believed in human rights and
    equal rights for men and women; he was not religious and was very strongly
    opposed to the Islamic Republic of Iran s regime. (Boroumand Center
    interview, August 21, 2021). Background on the Formation of the Kurdistan
    Democratic Party Following internal conflicts within the Democratic Party
    of Iranian Kurdistan established in 1945 with the aim of autonomy for
    Kurdistan in northwestern Iran the Party went through a shakeup in 2006
    and was split into two separate organizations, the Dem
