circumstances: >
    Case The execution of this person was reported in a 1990 Report of the
    Economic and Social Council of the United Nations on The Situation of
    Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. A/45/697. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. However,
    according to the UN Report, during this period: " ... trials before
    Islamic revolutionary courts have usually taken place in secret, sometimes
    inside prisons, ... defendants have not usually enjoyed the right to be
    represented by a lawyer, and often have not even been made aware that the
    proceedings were in fact a trial and not an interrogation session."
    Charges The defendant was charged with "murder". Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on this person's defense. Judgment No further information is
    available on the execution of the defendant.
