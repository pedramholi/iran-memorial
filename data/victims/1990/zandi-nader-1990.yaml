province: "Tehran"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Unspecified execution method"
circumstances: >
    he execution of Mr. Nader Zandi was mentioned in a list provided to the
    Special representative of the United Nation's Commission on Human Rights,
    Professor Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, by the Government of Iran. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. However it was reported to the special representative :
    " That trials before Islamic revolutionary courts have usually taken place
    in secret, sometimes inside prisons, that defendants have not usually
    enjoyed the right to be represented by a lawyer, and often have not even
    been made aware that the proceedings were in fact a trial and not an
    interrogation session.". Charges The defendant was charged with "murder"
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr./Ms. Zandi's defense. Judgment No
    further information is available on the verdict and the execution that
    took place in Tehran
