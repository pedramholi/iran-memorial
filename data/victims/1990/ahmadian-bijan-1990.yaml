    Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Bijan Ahmadian has
    been obtained from a list of persons allegedly executed in Iran. This list
    was published in a Report of the Economic and Social Council of the United
    Nations on The Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
    The report was prepared by Professor Reynaldo Galindo Pohl. A/45/697.
    Background of the extrajudicial killings by the Islamic Republic of Iran
    The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of politically motivated
    violence in Iran and around the world. Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic
    Republic operatives inside and outside the country have engaged in
    kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large number of individuals whose
    activities they deemed undesirable. The actual number of the victims of
    extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear; however, these murders
    began in February 1979 and have continued since then, both inside and
    outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has so far identified over
    540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic Republic of Iran.
    Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the Islamic Republic
    outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan,
    India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in the Middle East;
    Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and
    Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across the Atlantic Ocean.
    In most cases there has not been much published and the local authorities
    have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation, evidence, and traces
    obtained through investigations conducted by local police and judicial
    authorities confirm, however, the theory of state committed crimes. In
    certain cases, these investigations have resulted in the expulsion or
    arrest of Iranian diplomats. In limited cases outside Iran, the
    perpetrators of these murders have been arrested and put on trial and the
    evidence presented, revealed the defendants connection to Iran s
    government institutions, and an arrest warrant has been issued for Iran s
    Minister of Information. The manner in which these killings were organized
    and implemented in Iran and abroad, is indicative of a single pattern
    which, according to Roland Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor, contains common
    parameters and detailed planning. It can be ascertained from the
    similarities between these murders in different countries that the Iranian
    government is the principal entity who ordered the implementation of these
    crimes. Iranian authorities have not officially accepted responsibility
    for these murders and have even attributed their commission to internal
    strife in opposition groups. Nevertheless, since the very inception of the
    Islamic Republic regime, the Islamic Republic officials have justified
    these crimes from an ideological and legal standpoint. In the spring of
    1979, Sadeq Khalkhali, the first Chief Shari a Judge of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Courts, officially announced the regime s decision to
    implement extrajudicial executions, and justified the decision: These
    people have been sentenced to death; from the Iranian people s
    perspective, if someone wants to assassinate these individuals abroad, in
    any country, no government has any right to bring the perpetrator to trial
    as a terrorist, because such a person is the implementing agent of the
    sentence issued by the Islamic Revolutionary Court. Therefore, they are
    Mahduroddam and their sentence is death regardless of where they are. More
    than 10 years after these proclamations, in a speech about the security
    forces success, Ali Fallahian, the regime s Minister of Information stated
    the following regarding the elimination of members of the opposition: We
    have had success in inflicting damage to many of these little groups
    outside the country and on our borders At the same time, various
    political, judicial, and security officials of the Islamic Republic of
    Iran have, at different times and occasions, confirmed the existence of a
    long term government policy for these extrajudicial killings and in some
    cases their implementation. * Threats Against Mr. Bijan Ahmadian And His
    Death According to the United Nations Report, Mr. Ahmadian was gunned down
    and killed by government agents on a street in Babol, in 1989-1990. Mr.
    Ahmadian was the victim of an extrajudicial killing and the reason for his
    killing is not known. Officials Reaction Iranian government officials have
    not officially responded about the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Bijan
    Ahmadian. News of this killing was not publicized in the media at the
    time. Even so, according to the United Nations Report, Babol city
    officials refused to release Mr. Ahmadian s body to his family. It is said
    that members of Mr. Ahmadiam s family were arrested sometime after that.
    Family s Reaction There is no information on the reaction of the family to
    this killing. --------------------- *Read more about the background of
