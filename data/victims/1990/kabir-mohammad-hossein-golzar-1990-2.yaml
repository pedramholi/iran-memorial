    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Hossein Golzar Kabir was mentioned by the
    Special representative of the United Nation's Commission on Human Rights,
    Professor Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, in his report on the situation of human
    rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. A/45/697, 6 November 1990. This
    execution was also reported by the daily Kayhan on 15 February 1990. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Arrest and detention According to Kayhan's report the defendant
    was arrested on February 12th, 1990. He was executed on February 15th. His
    arrest and detention lasted three days. Trial The UN report indicates that
    on February 14th, 1990, a judicial panel was sent to Hamadan on behalf of
    the Head of the Judiciary to deal with this case. The trial lasted one
    day. Charges The defendant was charged with bank robbery and murder.
    Evidence of guilt According to Kayhan, part of the money, robbed from the
    Bank, was found in the defendant's residence. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Golzar Kabir's defense. The defendant was not allowed to
    appeal the sentence. Judgment On February 14th, 1990, the judicial panel
    representing the Head of the Judiciary issued the following sentence : "
    Mr. Mohammad Hossein Golzar Kabir, discharged employee of the Hamadan
    municipality, 74 lashes for committing robbery ; 74 lashes for
    participation in a forbidden act ,the infliction of three injuries, and
