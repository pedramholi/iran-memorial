    A/45/697. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.

    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant’s trial. However, it has been reported to
    the special representative: "That trials before Islamic revolutionary
    courts have usually taken place in secret, sometimes inside prisons, that
    defendants have not usually enjoyed the right to be represented by a
    lawyer, and often have not even been made aware that the proceedings were
    in fact a trial and not an interrogation session. Charges The defendant
    was charged with murder. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Davari's defense.
