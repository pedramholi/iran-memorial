    The information about the execution of the person in this case was made
    public by Radio Tehran along with the news of the execution of 22 other
    people whose names were not announced. This execution was mentioned by the
    Special representative of the United Nation's Commission on Human Rights,
    Professor Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, in his report on the situation of human
    rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. A/45/697, 6 November 1990.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. A 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of
    heroin, codeine or methadone) of proscribed narcotics has been used to
    sentence thousands of alleged drug traffickers to death, following
    judicial processes that fail to meet international standards. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    However it has been reported to the United Nations' special
    representative, that at the time of this execution : "trials before
    Islamic revolutionary Courts have usually taken place in secret, sometimes
    inside prisons, that defendants have not usually enjoyed the right to be
    represented by a lawyer, and often have not even been made aware that the
    proceedings were in fact a trial and not an interrogation session."
    Charges The defendant was charged with drug trafficking Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on this person's defense. Judgment No information is available
    about the sentence and the mode of execution.
