    Dr. Sirus Elahi is remembered as a stylish and optimistic person, but also
    as an inspiring man who left a long trail of people whose life he
    positively touched. Information regarding the extrajudicial execution of
    Mr. Sirius (also spelled "Cyrus") Elahi was obtained from several court
    transcripts 1, including Elahi v Islamic Republic of Iran, 124 F. Supp. 2d
    97 (D.C.C.2000) (digital version published on Justia.com), Cyrus Elahi;
    Transcript of Proceedings, November 9, 2000 (digital version published on
    the website of Iran Human Rights Documentation Center); and a variety of
    press publications. 2 Additional information was obtained from excerpts of
    several reports including No Safe Haven: Iran's Global Assassination
    Campaign published by the Iran Human Rights Documentation Centre (digital
    version, Feb 3, 2011), Defying the Iranian Revolution (Manouchehr Ganji,
    2002), Trends in Iranian External Assassination, Surveillance, and
    Abduction Plots, February 2022, Volume 15, Issue 2 (digital version); The
    Life and Times of the Shah (Gholam Reza Afkhami, 2009). Lastly, details
    were included from Iran dar hal-e Gozar video (Youtube, episode published
    in August 29, 2013), a televised interview of Ali Fallahian (July 9,
    2017); and reports from US death records, 83D Congress House of
    Representatives Report No 2140 dated July 28 1954, INSEE France (for the
    date of death of Yazdanseta). Sirus Elahi was born in 1943 in Iran. His
    father was a cardiologist, his mother a midwife. He was the eldest of four
    children. The family moved to the United States in 1958. Dr. Elahi went to
    high school in Long Island, then attended the American University in
    Washington D.C. for his undergraduate degree and Ph.D, which he obtained
    in 1967. He taught in the same university until 1972, when he returned to
    Iran. Upon his return, Dr. Elahi became an assistant professor of
    political science in the then Melli University in Tehran (now Beheshti
    University ). 3 He joined an unofficial think-tank 4 that analyzed Iran's
    economic, social, and political conditions and developments, and
    formulated recommendations addressed to the Queen. 5 In 1976, Dr. Elahi
    became a close advisor to then Minister of Education, Dr. Manuchehr Ganji,
    who remained a close friend and confidante to Dr. Elahi until his
    assassination. Following the revolution in 1979, Dr. Sirus Elahi was
    condemned to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal for having collaborated
    with the old regime. From that moment the Iranian authorities sought a way
    to eliminate him as discreetly as possible, according to a testimonial
    from Abol Qasem Mesbahi, 6 which determined his decision to leave Iran and
    enter into exile. Dr. Elahi and his wife settled in the United States
    where he took a position as an associate professor at Michigan State
    University. Dr. Elahi also engaged in political activism against the
    newly-established Islamic Republic. In the winter of 1979, Dr. Elahi,
    along with Dr. Ganji and two other colleagues, laid the foundation of the
    future Flag of Freedom Organization ( Derafsh-e Kaviani in Persian), which
    he hoped would work towards liberating Iran and establishing a pluralistic
    society. 7 Later, in 1986, Dr. Elahi moved to Paris to dedicate his full
    time to operating the Flag of Freedom Organization (the "FFO"). He was
    responsible for the organization s sensitive covert activities, including
    activating resistance cells and smuggling radio transmitters into Iran. In
    1989, Dr. Elahi became the organization s second-in-command and traveled
    extensively to promote the organization's cause and organize clandestine
    activities. He was responsible for much of the group's propaganda in Iran,
    which was made through radio programs and written material infiltrated
    into the country in tracts and pamphlets or sent by fax. 8 Dr. Sirus Elahi
    is remembered as a stylish and optimistic person, but also as an inspiring
    man who left a long trail of people whose life he positively touched. His
    younger sister Elham, for whom Dr. Elahi was a father figure, wrote about
    him to the U.S. tribunal in 2000, "...As our parents were divorced when
    the children were young, Sirus being the oldest child, adopted many of the
    father's responsibilities to his siblings. He financially and emotionally
    supported us, supported each of us with college tuition, as college
    advisor, even though he was working as a student himself [Sirus s]
    political hopes for Iran was a country [of] tolerance and [respect] for
    everyone's rights in a pluralistic democracy... he would say people cannot
    expect to have better government and conditions until they can better
    themselves personally. The Flag of Freedom Organization The Flag of
    Freedom (the FFO ) is described by its founders as a democratic opposition
    movement against the clerical regime in Iran, whose aims and purposes are
    the realization of the rights and freedoms of the Iranian people and the
    establishment of a pluralistic and parliamentary democracy in Iran. The
    FFO was a civil disobedien
