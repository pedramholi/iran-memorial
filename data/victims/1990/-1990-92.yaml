circumstances: >
    The information about the execution of this man was related in the
    November 1990 United Nations' report on the situation of human rights in
    the Islamic Republic of Iran. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. However it has
    been reported to the United Nations' special representative, that at the
    time of this execution : "trials before Islamic revolutionary Courts have
    usually taken place in secret, sometimes inside prisons, that defendants
    have not usually enjoyed the right to be represented by a lawyer, and
    often have not even been made aware that the proceedings were in fact a
    trial and not an interrogation session." Charges The defendant was charged
    with "rape". Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on this person's defense. Judgment The
    Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Mashhad found the defendant guilty and
    sentenced him to death. The execution took place in a public square.
