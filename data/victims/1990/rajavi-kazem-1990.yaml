    Washington Report on Middle Eastern Affairs (June 1990); Der
    Schweizerische Beobachter (16 August 1991); Independent (1 January 1994);

    Swiss Federal Criminal Court (23 September 2021) were used as sources. ABC

    Kazem Rajavi, born on 18 February 1934 in Mashhad in North-Eastern Iran,
    was a university professor and human rights activist. He moved to France
    in 1959 to continue his studies and gained doctoral degrees in law,
    political science and sociology. Mr. Rajavi taught at multiple
    universities across France and Switzerland. He was married with two sons
    and a daughter and lived in Switzerland. In 1971, whilst Kazem Rajavi was
    living in Switzerland, his brother, Massoud, a member of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization, was imprisoned and sentenced to death. He mobilised
    Amnesty International, other groups and politicians to put pressure on
    Iran. With the assistance of Geneva lawyers and others, Mr. Rajavi founded
    the Swiss Association for the Defense of Political Prisoners in Iran and
    won a stay of execution, commuting the sentence to life in prison for
    humanitarian reasons (ge.ch website). It is following this campaign that
    Mr. Rajavi became involved in advocacy and campaigning to shed light on
    human rights violations in Iran, and Switzerland granted him political
    asylum. Mr. Rajavi was on the left of the political spectrum and opposed
    the monarchy. In 1974, he completed his doctoral thesis on La dictature du
    prol tariat et le d p rissement de l' tat, de Marx L nine (The
    dictatorship of the proletariat and the decline of the State, from Marx to
    Lenin), which was published in 1975. He is also the author of La
    Revolution Iranienne et les Moujahedins, (The Iranian Revolution and the
    Mojahedins) published in 1983. Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979,
    Mr. Rajavi was appointed as the first Ambassador to the United Nations in
    Geneva for the Islamic Republic of Iran. However, in 1981 he left the
    position, after just one year, in protest to the repressive policies of
    the State, including the assassination of adversaries (Witness C
    documentary, testimony of Jean Ziegler). After leaving his diplomatic
    position, Mr. Rajavi was granted political asylum in Switzerland in 1981
    and became the representative of the National Council of Resistance of
    Iran (NCRI) in Switzerland. Throughout the 1980s, Mr. Rajavi, dedicated
    his time to shedding light on the human rights violations of the Islamic
    Republic. He is accredited with contributing to the establishment of the
    mandate of the Special Rapporteur for Iran and the first resolutions on
    Iran of the United Nations Committee on Human Rights, condemning the
    atrocities of the Regime. As a result of his advocacy, he became known to
    the Iranian State and reportedly received death threats from the Islamic
    Republic including in the form of an official fatwa (Iran Focus, 2016,
    Tribune de Geneve, 2015). He had also received death threats including
    from an Iranian official in Geneva. According to Nils de Dardel, one of
    the lawyers in charge of the case on behalf of Rajavi s family members and
    a friend of Kazem Rajavi, the latter felt threatened. He had asked de
    Dardel to request the Lausanne s police justice department for personal
    protection, which he had done without success. (Witness C documentary).
    Mr. Kazem Rajavi s Extrajudicial Execution Around midday on 24 April 1990,
    Mr. Rajavi was driving back to his house in Coppet, close to Geneva, when,
    according to witness reports, his route was blocked by two cars. Three men
    were reported to have jumped out of the cars and bega
