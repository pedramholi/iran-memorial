    The deliberations were not public, and Mr. Abnus a 22-year-old man charged
    with serious crimes in Qom almost certainly lacked representation. The
    news of the execution of Mr. Hamid Abnus was published in the Kayhan
    newspaper on August 11, 1990. This execution was also acknowledged in a
    list provided to the Special representative of the United Nation s
    Commission on Human Rights, Professor Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, by the
    Government of Iran. This list was published in a 1990 Report of the
    Economic and Social Council of the United Nations on The Situation of
    Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran (A/45/697). Arrest and
    Detention According to the Kayhan newspaper, the defendant was arrested a
    week before the publication of the news. Other details about this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial The defendant was
    tried in Qom Criminal Court. No other information is available on the
    defendant s trial. However, it has been reported to the special
    representative: That trials before Islamic revolutionary courts have
    usually taken place in secret, sometimes inside prisons; that defendants
    have not usually enjoyed the right to be represented by a lawyer, and
    often have not even been made aware that the proceedings were in fact a
    trial and not an interrogation session. Charges According to the Kayhan
    newspaper, the defendant kidnapped 8 girls, ages between 6 and 8, and
    raped them during the four months period before his arrest. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Hamid Abnus s defense. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Hamid Abnus to 74 lashes and death. On August 9, 1990,
    he received 74 lashes and was beheaded in public and in the presence of
    judiciary officials in a street of Qom.
