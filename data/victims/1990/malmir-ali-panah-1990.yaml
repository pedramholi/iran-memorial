    execution was obtained through the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s
    interviews conducted with persons with knowledge of the case on June 1 and
    29, 2018, and August 8, 2018 (ABC interview). Kayhan newspaper also

    wife was pregnant. He had five sisters and a brother, with one of his
    younger sisters and two younger brothers living with his parents. In
    addition to being a teacher, Mr. Malmir had a minibus that he drove and
    thus provided for the expenses of his family and his elderly parents.
    According to people with knowledge of the case, he was known among his
    relatives and the village people as an educated, successful, and handsome
    man. Members of his family and close relatives described him as a kind,
    funny, caring, and responsible individual. Mr. Malmir s case is related to
    the death of a young man in the course of a group altercation over
    agricultural water use in the village. Arrest and detention After the
    altercation in the spring of 1990, the region s police force arrested Mr.
    Ali Panah Malmir at his home along with a number of other male members of
    his family. According to the interviewees, after the fight occurred on the
    farm and the injured individual was taken to the hospital, the latter s
    relatives attacked the homes of Mr. Malmir and his relatives with such
    intensity that the police had to intervene to defend their lives. The
    police then arrested Mr. Malmir, his brothers, and several other men in
    the family and took them to a detention center in the city of Nahavand.
    Mr. Malmir was interrogated there. Mr. Malmir was detained at Nahavand
    Prison. According to persons with knowledge of the case, Mr. Malmir was
    released on bail for a few days and was then returned to prison. During
    the few months that he spent in jail, Mr. Malmir was allowed weekly
    visitations with his family from behind bars. In mid-October 1990, prison
    officials told Mr. Malmir s family to come to the prison for a last
    visitation. That visitation with a large group of his family members and
    relatives took place in a small room in the Nahavand Prison yard. Trial
    Mr. Malmir s case was initially heard at the Nahavand Court, but the judge
    subsequently referred it to the Province capital stating that it could not
    issue a ruling in the case. (ABC interview). Hamedan Province Criminal
    Court, Branch One, adjudicated Mr. Malmir s case. (Kayhan newspaper).
    Charges The court charged Mr. Malmir with intentional murder . (Kayhan
    newspaper). According to available information, he was accused of having
    murdered a young man in the course of a mass altercation. (ABC interview)
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt According to available information, a few days prior to
    the event, the murder victim had beaten Mr. Malmir s father, an elderly
    man, stating that he had used their share of irrigation water to irrigate
    his own farm. Mr. Ali Panah Malmir went to him to protest his actions but
    the victim and his brothers attacked him. Mr. Malmir s brothers and
    relatives got themselves to the scene of the altercation to defend him and
    a group fight ensued. In the course of the altercation, the murder victim
    lost consciousness and was taken to the hospital, where it was determined
    that he was in a coma due to blows to his head. The murder victim s family
    then attacked Mr. Malmir and his relatives homes, killing their livestock,
    destroying their property, and setting their houses on fire. Persons with
    knowledge of the case claimed that the victim s father had said that since
    the fight was over the father of the family, that he had to introduce his
    best son as the murderer. That was why Mr. Ali Panah Malmir had been
    introduced. The victim s family stated in their complaint that Mr. Ali
    Panah Malmir was the person who had committed the murder. The victim s
    brother testified against the Defendant in court; however, his and other
    impartial eyewitnesses testimony and description of the events was not
    sufficient to find Mr. Malmir guilty of murder. Furthermore, the court
    accepted the swearing of ten of the victim s relatives and acquaintances
    in the form of Qassameh * as evidence. (ABC interview) Defense Mr. Malmir
    denied the charge of murder at various stages of the adjudication. The
    eyewitnesses present at the crime scene also testified that they had not
    seen the Defendant strike a direct blow to the victim. According to
