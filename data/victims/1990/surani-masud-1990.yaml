    The execution of Mr. Masu'd Surani was acknowledged in a list provided to
    the Special representative of the United Nation's Commission on Human
    Rights, Professor Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, by the Government of Iran This
    list was published in a 1990 Report of the Economic and Social Council of
    the United Nations on The Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. A/45/697. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Arrest and detention No information is available on
    the defendant s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on
    the defendant s trial. However, it has been reported to the special
    representative: "That trials before Islamic revolutionary courts have
    usually taken place in secret, sometimes inside prisons; that defendants
    have not usually enjoyed the right to be represented by a lawyer, and
    often have not even been made aware that the proceedings were in fact a
    trial and not an interrogation session.". Charges Mr. Roshanaii was
    accused of "rape and kidnapping" Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.Abnous's
    defense. Judgment No further information is available on the verdict and
    the execution that took place in Qom
