circumstances: >
    The information about the execution of Mr. Gholam Reza Mansouri was
    related in the November 1990 United Nations' report on the situation of
    human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The report refers to the
    February 15th, 1990 issue of the Iranian daily Resalat. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. However it has
    been reported to the United Nations' special representative, that at the
    time of this execution : "trials before Islamic revolutionary Courts have
    usually taken place in secret, sometimes inside prisons, that defendants
    have not usually enjoyed the right to be represented by a lawyer, and
    often have not even been made aware that the proceedings were in fact a
    trial and not an interrogation session." Charges The defendant was charged
    with "sodomy". Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Mansouri's defense. Judgment
    The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Arak found the defendant guilty and
    sentenced him to death. Mr. Mansouri was hanged in Arak.
