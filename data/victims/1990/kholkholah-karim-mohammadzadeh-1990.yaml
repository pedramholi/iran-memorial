    412/92). Mr. Karim Mohammadzadeh joined the ranks of the Peshmerga of the
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) as a teenager around the end
    of 1979 or the early months of 1980. It is not known if Mr. Mohammadzadeh
    s finished high school. In the late 1980s, Mr. Mohammadzadeh was severely
    injured during an operation to take over bases from government forces
    trying to get control of Oshnavieh in the West Azerbaijan province of
    Iran, all the way to Khakurk mountains in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. A
    bullet hit his shoulder and jaw and broke his jaw, subsequently forcing
    him to undergo several surgeries to repair his jaw. He had massive scars
    on his face and could not eat solid food for over a year (ABC interview,
    December 15, 2021). Before being injured, in 1981, during the conflict
    between the PDKI and the Kurdistan Democratic Party [ of Iraq ] (PDK), Mr.
    Mohammadzadeh had been held captive and tortured by Ghiade Movaghat, a
    group that collaborated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to
    suppress Kurdish movements in Iran and was hospitalized after his
    detention. [1] Mr. Mohammadzadeh arrived as a quota refugee in Sweden as
    part of the resettlement program in late December 1989 with 14 other
    Peshmergas who were all wounded and needed treatment and surgery. They all
    got permanent residence in Sweden (ABC interview, December 15, 2021). Mr.
    Mohammadzadeh was taken to the Regional Hospital in Link ping to undergo
    plastic surgery to reconstruct his face and receive treatment for his
    injuries. He arrived in Nyn shamn after his hospital stay. He was happy
    with the outcome of the surgery, which corrected the huge scar he had on
    his face. Yet he still couldn t eat solid foods and continued to eat
    primarily soups and lighter food. He began taking Swedish classes to learn
    the language. He dreamed of starting over in Sweden. Through friends and
    family in Iran, he came in contact with a woman in Iran. They were
    planning a wedding and she was to join him in Sweden ( I nationens
    intresse, 2003) . The Kurdish Problem in the Islamic Republic After the
    1979 Islamic Revolution, the disagreements between the government of the
    Shiite Islamic Republic and the organizations in the Kurdish regions of
    western Iran regarding the rights and roles of minorities in drafting the
    Constitution; whether the government should be secular or religious, and
    especially the issue of Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in
    Kurdish political organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on
    instituting an Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed,
    clashes between the central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan
    Democratic Party s armed forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini
    labeled the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), the oldest and
    most influential Kurdish Party, the Party of the Devil , and declared it
    unofficial and illegal and ordered a military attack on Kurdistan. Mass
    executions and intense armed clashes continued in the region for months,
    clashes that resulted in the deaths of a number of civilians and the
    displacement and relocation of the residents of certain towns. In the next
