    Mr. Tatpur was from the town of Galugah in Mazandaran Province. He was a
    supporter of the Mojahenid e Khalq Organization of Iran. He was one of the
    people who escaped the killings of political prisoners in the summer of
    1988. Information about the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Faramarz Tatpur
    was published in the Mojahedin e Khalq Organization Website (December 26,
    2016). Additional information on this case was taken from Asoo Website
    (February 1, 2019), and Eshterak Website (August 17, 2019). Mr. Faramarz
    Tatpur was from the town of Galugah in Mazandaran Province. He was a
    supporter of the Mojahedin e Khalq Organization (Mojahedin e Khalq
    Organization Website, December 26, 2016). According to available
    information, he spent part of the 80s in prison, and he was one of the
    people who escaped the killings of political prisoners in the summer of
    1988 (1). (Asoo Website, February 1, 2019; Eshterak Website, August 17,
    2019) The Mojahedin Khalq Organization The Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted the principles of
    Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members interpretation of
    Islam was revolutionary and they believed in armed struggle against the
    Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive method for economic
    and social analysis but considered Islam as their source of inspiration,
    culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was weakened when many of its
    members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975, following a deep
    ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its ideology and,
    after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim members purged,
    the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This move led to
    split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO in 1977. In January of
    1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were released along with
    other political prisoners. They began to reorganize the MKO and recruit
    new members based on Islamic ideology. After the 1979 Revolution and the
    establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO accepted the leadership of
    Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the Revolution. Active participation in
    the political scene and infiltration of governmental institutions were
    foremost on the organization s agenda. During the first two years after
    the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in recruiting numerous sympathizers,
    especially in high schools and universities; but its efforts to gain
    political power, either by appointment or election, were strongly opposed
    by the Islamic Republic leaders. (2) Background of Extrajudicial Killings
    by the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long
    history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world.
    Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside
    the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since
    then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has
    so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases there has not been much published and
    the local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
    evidence, and traces obtained through investigations conducted by local
    police and judicial authorities confirm, however, the theory of state
    committed crimes. In certain cases, these investigations have resulted in
    the expulsion or arrest of Iranian diplomats. In limited cases outside
    Iran, the perpetrators of these murders have been arrested and put on
    trial and the evidence presented, revealed the defendants connection to
    Iran s government institutions, and an arrest warrant has been issued for
    Iran s Minister of Information. The manner in which these killings were
    organized and implemented in Iran and abroad, is indicative of a single
    pattern which, according to Roland Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor,
    contains common parameters and detailed planning. It can be ascertained
    from the similarities between these murders in different countries that
    the Iranian government is the principal entity who ordered the
    implementation of these crimes. Iranian authorities have not officially
    accepted responsibility for these murders and have even attributed their
    commission to internal strife in opposition groups. Nevertheless, since
    the very inception of the Islamic Republic regime, the Islamic Republic
    officials have justified these crimes from
