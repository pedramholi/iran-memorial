    The information about Mr. Hossein Sudmand has been drawn from the Kalameh
    magazine (No. 49, March 1, 2005), the website of the Campaign to Support
    and Free Ramtin Sudmand (son of Mr. Hossein Sudmand), and the interview of
    Radio Farda with his daughter. Mr. Hossein Sudmand was born in Mashad in a
    religious Muslim family. He served his compulsory military service in
    Ahvaz and converted to Christianity. He then migrated to Esfahan and
    started working in a hospital. After the Islamic Revolution of 1979, he
    was expelled from the hospital and returned to Mashad. According to
    available information, Reverend Sudmand used his house in Mashad as a
    church. After some time he had to close this church due to the pressures
    of the Iranian government. He was imprisoned for one month. He and his
    family were threatened to stop proselytizing and denounce their faith in
    Christianity. The Church advised the Sudmand family to leave Iran for
    Greece but Reverend Sudmand said that he will remain in Iran to serve God,
    even if such a service comes at a price. He was married and had four
    children ( Kalameh ). Arrest and detention The circumstances of Mr.
    Sudmand arrest and detention are not known. He was arrested in the fall of
    1990 and detained for a few weeks. After his release from prison, he was
    summoned for a second time and he surrendered himself to judicial
    authorities; his family was unaware of his whereabouts. Trial There is no
    information regarding this trial. Charges The Kalameh magazine reports the
    charge brought against Mr. Sudmand to be “not denouncing his faith in
    Christianity.” Although the articles on the Campaign to Support and Free
    Ramtin Sudmand refer to “apostasy” as the charge, his daughter told Radio
    Farda that the official charge was never announced to the family. Evidence
    of guilt No information is available concerning the evidence presented
    against the accused. Defense No information is available concerning Mr.
    Sudmand’s defense. Judgment No specific information is available about the
    verdict leading to this execution. According to Kalameh , on December 3,
    1990, state authorities informed Mr. Hossein Sudmand’s family that he “had
    been hanged for remaining steadfast in Christianity and buried in a suburb
    of Mashad.”
