circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Aziz Narouie was acknowledged in a list provided to
    the Special representative of the United Nation's Commission on Human
    Rights, Professor Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, by the Government of Iran This
    list was published in a 1990 Report of the Economic and Social Council of
    the United Nations on The Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. A/45/697. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. However, it
    has been reported to the special representative: "That trials before
    Islamic revolutionary courts have usually taken place in secret, sometimes
    inside prisons, that defendants have not usually enjoyed the right to be
    represented by a lawyer, and often have not even been made aware that the
    proceedings were in fact a trial and not an interrogation session."
    Charges Mr. Narouie was charged with "Activity against the security of the
    country, co-operation with armed rebels and drug traffickers, and
    participation in armed conflict..." The UN reports indicates that :"the
    source of the information presumed that his arrest, as well as the arrest
    of a group of other persons, was related to an incident in which a
    Government opponent, of whom the defendent was a relative, was smuggled
    out of the Islamic Republic of Iran...." Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Narouie's defense. Judgment Mr. Narouie was sentenced to death in the city
    of Zahedan. No further information is available on the sentence and the
    execution.
