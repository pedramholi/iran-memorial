    The news of Mr. A. B. s execution was announced by Asr-e Dena website on
    May 31, 2012. Mr. A. B. was from a village in the Doshman Ziyari area, and
    his case pertains to the wounding of a small girl and murder of two small
    boys in 2010. Arrest and Detention Mr. A. B. hid himself in the Doshman
    Ziyari mountains for a while after the incident. He later handed himself
    over to the authorities. He was imprisoned in Yasuj Central Prison and
    Gachsaran Prison for two years. Trial No information is available on Mr.
    A. B. s trial. Charges Mr. A. B. was charged with "murder". He was accused
    of killing two boys and wounding a girl by shooting at them with an AK-47
    owing to a family feud. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. A. B. Defense Mr. A. B. said he regretted
    what he had done. There is no information available on his defense.
    Judgement Mr. A. B. was sentenced to death. He was hanged under security
    conditions in the courtyard of Gachsaran Prison on May 31, 2012. He was
    buried in the Kalat Village of Kohkiluyeh.
