    was a wrestler and had participated in several wrestling championships.
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center was informed of the news of the execution of
    Mr. Jalal Zahedi, 26, son of Minoo and Alireza, through independent
    research and the center s interview with one of Mr. Zahedi s acquaintances
    (October 10, 2017). Mr. Zahedi, known as Khoshkhan, was a Shiite and a
    bachelor who was from Islamabad-e Gharb in Kermanshah Province, where he
    also used to live. He had a diploma in mechanics, was self-employed, and
    occasionally traded in crops. Mr. Zahedi was a simple and generous person
    and had a good relationship with his acquaintances. He was a bodybuilder
    and an amateur wrestler who participated in wrestling championships a few
    times. According to the available information, the case of Mr. Zahedi
    pertains to sexual crimes. He had a prior criminal record. Arrest and
    detention On March 2, 2009 a woman filed a complaint against Mr. Zahedi
    for abduction and rape at the provincial Ministry of Justice office of
    Sarpol-e Zahab. Following the complaint, and consequent to the order of
    the provincial Criminal Court of Islamabad-e Gharb, Mr. Zahedi was
    prosecuted. He was eventually arrested by the agents of the Police Force
    of Intelligence and Public Security of Islamabad-e Gharb in the
    transportation terminal of the city at 5 PM on July 3, 2011. Mr. Zahedi
    carried a knife on his person when he was arrested. He threw his cell
    phone amidst the crowd in the terminal so that the police could not get
    access to its contents. The agents were unable to find the cell phone
    amidst the crowd. Sometime after she had filed a complaint against Mr.
    Zahedi, the plaintiff signed an affidavit in the Notary Office No. 138 in
    Islamabad-e Gharb on March 15, 2009 and retracted her complaint. However,
    after Mr. Zahedi was arrested, she filed a second complaint against him at
    the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Sarpol-e Zahab County.
    According to one of Mr. Zahedi s acquaintances, after encircling Mr.
    Zahedi, the plainclothes agents of the police force arrested him without
    producing any arrest warrant. Mr. Zahedi resisted arrest. Mr. Zahedi was
    moved to Islamabad-e Gharb Central Prison on July 4, 2011. He made contact
    with his family two days after his arrest, and met them in person one
    month later. The family of Mr. Zahedi hired two lawyers for him on July
    31, 2011. He met the lawyers once in prison. Trial Mr. Zahedi went on
    trial for the first time in the provincial Criminal Court of Islamabad-e
    Gharb on July 4, 2011. During the first session of his trial he denied the
    charges against him and said that he had only been in touch with the
    plaintiff on the phone and with the intention of marrying her. He also
    vehemently denied any connection with the other plaintiff in the case. The
    second session of Mr. Zahedi s trial was held on August 8, 2011. In this
    session the Public Prosecutor of Islamabad-e Gharb and Mr. Zahedi s
    lawyers were also present in addition to the judges and the jury.
    According to the available information, the plaintiff, due to ethical
    considerations and in view of the traditions of the region, would not
    attend the court. Mr. Zahedi s family and witnesses who had gone to the
    court to testify in favor of him were not allowed to attend the trial
    session (ABC interview). Charges Mr. Zahedi was charged with forced rape,
    participation in abduction, threat to murder, profanity and illicit
    relations. The accusation against him was that on February 21, 2010, after
    threating the victim with a knife in the Ahmad Ben Eshaq neighborhood of
    Sarpol-e Zahab, he had forcefully dragged her into the Peugeot car of his
    friend and taken her to his house on Moallem Street and kept her there for
    two days. Mr. Zahedi was accused of then having rendered the victim
    unconscious by putting a drug in her orange juice and eventually raping
    her. Mr. Zahedi was alleged to have recorded the rape and then to have
    used the film to threaten the victim into leaving her husband for him. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt Mr. Zahedi s knife and cell phone
    were two pieces of evidence of guilt that were entered against him.
    According to the contents of the case, these were also among the evidence
    of guilt entered against Mr. Zahedi: 1) the complaint o
