    The news of Mr. F. B. s execution along with eleven others was announced
    on November 12, 2012 by the websites of the Fars Province Judiciary, IRNA
    (the Islamic Republic news agency), and Fars News, all quoting the public
    relations section of the Fars Province Judiciary. Mr. F. B. s case
    concerns narcotics trafficking in Neyriz County in 2011. Arrest and
    Detention Mr. F. B. was arrested in 2011 after drugs were discovered in
    his car. However, there is no information available on the details of his
    arrest and detention. Trial Mr. F. B. was tried by the Revolutionary Court
    of Neyriz Township. However, there is no information available on the
    session or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. F. B. was charged with drug
    trafficking. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    Possession of five kilograms of opium as well as four kilograms and seven
    hundred grams of heroin was entered as evidence against Mr. F. B. Neyriz.
    Defense Mr. F. B. asked for pardon, but his appeal was rejected. There is
    no information available on the details of his defense. Judgment The
    Revolutionary Court of Neyriz County sentenced Mr. F. B. to execution as
    well as fifteen years of imprisonment. The verdict was approved by the
    Chief Public Prosecutor and the head of the Judiciary. Mr. F. B. was
    hanged in public in Neyriz County on Monday, November 12, 2012.
