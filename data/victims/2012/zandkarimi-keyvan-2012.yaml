    Keyvan Zandkarimi was a Sunni Kurd, who lived in Sanandaj. His interests
    were serving his friends and Muslims, always reciting and memorizing the
    Qur an. News of the execution of Mr. Kayvan Zandkarimi was published on
    Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) and Roozonline websites on
    December 30, 2012. Additional information about this case was drawn from
    research carried out by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF), with
    interviews from ABF with several persons close to Mr. Zandkarimi and his
    cellmates; a published letter by his cellmates (HRANA April 25, 2014); a
    letter by Sunni clergies to authorities (Jaras on September 18, 2013, and
    Roozonline on September 23, 2013), and several other resources, including
    the Centre for Supporters of Human Rights on May 4, 2014; the website and
    Facebook page of the International Campaign to Support Sunni Prisoners; Al
    Arabiya on September 19, 2013; Sunni News; and YouTube. Mr. Kayvan
    Zandkarimi, 24, was a high school graduate and a welder in a shed-building
    company. He was a Sunni Kurd who lived in Sanandaj. His family was
    religious, and his father a worker. He was married recently, but his wife
    was divorced after his arrest. Mr. Zandkarimi was a calm person who faced
    difficulties patiently. He was compassionate and confidential toward
    people close to him. His concerns were serving his friends and Muslims and
    always recited and memorized the Qur an. (Interview with ABF) According to
    his cellmates, Mr. Zandkarimi was not an affiliate of any group or
    organization. He believed in the Shafei religion and had memorized eight
    sections of the Qur an. He and other Sunni prisoners, who were condemned
    to death, performed their religious activities in their mosques and
    quarters. Among these activities were to distribute pamphlets and CD s
    regarding Shi a authorities insults of Sunni beliefs. They promoted Shafe
    i beliefs among Sunnis and tried to avoid taking advantage of the
    religion. (Centre for Supporters of Human Rights on May 04, 2014) Human
    rights organizations have protested the death sentences against these
    Sunni activists and due process violations in their cases. Nineteen human
    rights organizations issued statements objecting to these sentences and
    demanding their annulment. (June 20, 2014) Sunni religious leaders, such
    as Molavi Abdolhamid, Friday Emam of Zahedan, and Hassan Amini, Director
    of the Emam Bokhara religious school in Sanandaj, issued open letters to
    the Supreme Leader and heads of the executive, judicial, and legislative
    branches of the Islamic Republic of Iran, calling for the annulment of the
    death penalty for Sunni prisoners. (Al Arabiya, September 19, 2013) Arrest
    and detention Mr. Kayvan Zandkarimi was arrested at Sanandaj Terminal and
    transferred to the detention center of Information Administration in
    Sanandaj on July 18, 2009. He spent nineteen months in solitary
    confinement at the Information Ministry detention centers in Sanandaj,
    Hamedan, and Tehran. He was frequently tortured physically and
    psychologically during his detention period. According to his cellmates,
    his interrogators used electric shocks, applied lashing, and threat in
    order to get him to confess to having links to extremist groups whose goal
    was to overthrow the regime. (ABF research) Mr. Zandkarimi had no access
    to an attorney, nor any visitation with his family during his
    interrogation. Except for a few times, they did not allow him to call his
    family either. In February of 2012, he and other Sunni prisoners were
    transferred to Raja ishahr Prison and later to Qezelhesar Prison on
    November 13, 2012. Trial Branch 28 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Tehran tried Mr. Zandkarimi and nine other co-defendants in a closed
    session on February 12, 2011. Based on the testimony of four defendants,
    they were not allowed to choose their defense attorneys. Each met the
    attorney assigned to him less than half an hour before the trial was to
    sign his engagement letter. The defendants were taken to court and tried
    while handcuffed, shackled, and blindfolded. The session lasted only 10
    minutes. (A letter sent by four cellmates of Mr. Zandkarimi to the
    international community and the website of Sunni Prisoners) According to
    several defendants, the judge did not question defendants and had a vulgar
    and insulting behavior toward them. (A defendant s will - ABF research)
    Charges Based on the testimony of four defendants, Mr. Kayvan Zandkarimi
    and his co-defendants were accused of waging war against God, through
    links to Salafi mini-groups and propaganda against the regime, through
    participating in ideological and political classes and possessing,
    selling, and buying books and CDs of speeches related to Sunni beliefs.
    (Letter to Ban Ki-moon, September 2012 - ABF research) The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against the defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt No
