    Information about Mr. Naser Albushukeh Derafshan was taken from an
    announcement of Human Rights Watch (2/7/2012), the Justice for Iran
    Organization (2/20/2012), Roozonline (6/26/2012) and Deutsche Welle Farsi
    (2/4/2013). Additional information about these protests has been gathered
    from interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation, with
    several eyewitnesses and from a report by Milan Kothari, the UN Special
    Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, as well as reports by Amnesty
    International, Human Rights Watch, Ahvaz Human Rights Organization, Ahvaz
    News Agency, Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA), Islamic Republic News
    Agency (IRNA), and news websites including the BBC and Gooya News.* Mr.
    Naser Albushukeh Derafshan, 19, was single and a resident of Ahvaz.
    According to people close to him, he was healthy and athletic. He had
    recently completed his draft service and managed a small clothing store at
    Naderi Street in Ahvaz. He was not affiliated with any political group and
    had no political activities. ( Roozonline on June 26, 2012) Arrest and
    detention Mr. Albushukeh was arrested at his store by agents of the Ahvaz
    Intelligence Office, during the mass arrest of young people in the Arab
    quarters of Shush, Hamidieh, and Ahvaz, in January and February of 2012.
    These arrests took place following the widespread display of slogans in
    support of the Arab Spring and the boycotting of the upcoming
    parliamentary elections across those cities. According to a person close
    to him, who spoke during an interview with Roozonline , Mr. Albushukeh had
    no connection with those activities. On January 26, 2012, someone from the
    Ahvaz Intelligence Office contacted his family and informed them of his
    arrest. During his period of detention, evident marks of torture and
    beating, such as black and blue skin, have been reported by Mr. Albushukeh
    s family. A Summary of the Khuzestan Protests Subsequent to the
    publication of a letter dated July 24, 1998, ascribed to then-President
    Khatami s Chief of Staff, Mohammad Ali Abtahi, demonstrations protesting
    the letter broke out on Friday, April 15, 2005, first in [the city of]
    Ahvaz, and then in other cities, such as Mahshahr and Hamidideh, and
    continued for several days. The letter emphasized the modification of
    Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab population through promotion and
    encouragement of the migration of non-native populations to the province,
    [thus] reducing Khuzestan s Arab population to one third of the total
    population of the province. Although the government s spokesperson
    officially denied [the existence of] this letter on Saturday, April 16,
    the demonstrations that had been called for by the Coordination Committee
    for Popular Protests in Ahvaz continued extensively in the coming days. In
    calling for demonstrations, [the organizers] highlighted various factors,
    including the central government s policies in expropriating Arab farmers
    lands for various projects such as sugar cane development, and
    marginalization of, as well as profound discontent among, Khuzestan s Arab
    [population], as a result of the regime s efforts to obliterate Arab
    identity. The demonstrations that had started in Kui-e Alavi
    (Shelangabad/Da ereh),, one of [the city of] Ahvaz s poor neighborhoods,
    quickly spread to the center of Ahvaz and to the cities of Mahshahr and
    Hamidieh. Citing Ahvaz News (a regional news organization) and
    eyewitnesses at the scene, the Ahvaz Human Rights Organization s bulletin,
    dated April 15, 2005, stated, Around three thousand Arab people of Ahvaz
    have gathered together and started extensive but peaceful demonstrations
    in Kordovani Street and Square, along with thousands of others in
    neighborhoods such as Shelangabad, Malashieh, Ameri, and Kut Abdollah,
    among others. Security forces are attacking the demonstrators, first with
    tear gas, and are subsequently firing on them in Da ereh and Malashieh
    neighborhoods. The degree of violence resorted to by security and police
    forces in quashing the demonstrations was such that it led to the death of
    a number of protestors. Dozens more were injured. Subsequent to these
    deaths, the intensity and magnitude of the protests increased. In a number
    of towns, demonstrators proceeded to cut off roads and to occupy
    government buildings and police posts. These protests continued for ten
    days in many Arab regions of Khuzestan. Protestors demanded a government
    apology to the region s Arabs. Official government sources, quoting the
    Islamic Republic s Defense Minister, announced the death toll as standing
    at three or four. (ISNA, April 19, 2005) Civil society activists, however,
    declared the number of people killed during these events to be between 50
    and 60. Amnesty International stated the number as 29; Human Rights Watch
    , 50; and the Ahvaz Human Rights Organization , 160. Dozens of others were
    injured. The Ahvaz General and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office announced
    the arrest and arraignment of 447 individuals. (IRNA, April 25,
