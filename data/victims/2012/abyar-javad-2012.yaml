    The news of Mr. Javad Abyar s execution along with three others was
    announced by HRANA, the Human Rights Activists News Agency, on May 11,
    2012. His case pertains to storing and carrying narcotics in 2011.
    According to the report by HRANA, official government media refused to
    give coverage to these executions. Arrest and Detention Mr. Abyar was kept
    in custody in Kerman Prison from 2011. However, there is no information
    available on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial No information
    is available on Mr. Javad Abyar s trial. Charges Mr. Abyar was charged
    with carrying and storing narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against Mr. Abyar. Defense Mr. Abyar had no criminal
    history. There is no information available on his defense. Judgment Mr.
    Abyar was hanged along with three others in Kerman Prison on Wednesday,
    April 19, 2012.
