    The news of Mr. Ram Esmail Hafshajani s execution along with two others
    was announced by the websites of Chaharmahal and Bakhtyari Central News
    Unit, the Young Reporters Club of Chaharmahal and Bakhtyari Province
    (April 11, 2012), the Young Reporters Club (April 10, 2012), and ISNA, the
    Iranian Students News Agency (April 14, 2012), all quoting the Deputy
    Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor of Shahr-e Kord County. His case
    concerns carrying narcotics. Arrest and Detention Mr. Hafshajani was
    arrested on June 8, 2010. According to the Chaharmahal and Bakhtyari
    Central News Unit, he was imprisoned for two years. However, there is no
    information available on the details of his arrest and detention. Trial
    Mr. Hafshajani was tried by the Revolutionary Court of Shahr-e Kord.
    However, there is no information available on the session or sessions of
    his trial. Charges Mr. Hafshajani was charged with "Drug Trafficking". He
    was accused of carrying heroin, crack, and methamphetamine. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the
    Chaharmahal and Bakhtyari Central News Unit, possession of 400 grams of
    crack, 22 grams of methamphetamine, and 14 grams of hashish was entered as
    evidence against Mr. Hafshajani. Defense Mr. Hafshajani asked for pardon,
    but his appeal was rejected. There is no information available on his
    defense. Judgment Mr. Ram Esmail Hafshajani was sentenced to death by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shahr-e Kord. After the verdict was
    approved, he and two others were hanged in Shahr-e Kord Central Prison on
    April 10, 2012.
