    The news of Mr. A. A. s execution along with one other was announced by
    the website of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of Markazi
    Province on January 3, 2012 and was also quoted by ISNA, the Iranian
    Students News Agency. His case pertains to drug trafficking. Arrest and
    Detention The circumstances of Mr. A. A. s arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial Mr. A. A. was tried by Branch One of the Revolutionary Court
    of Arak County. However, there is no information available on the session
    or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. A. A. was charged with carrying
    narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    It was announced that Mr. A. A. possessed four kilograms and four hundred
    and fifty grams of crack. Defense No information is available on Mr. A. A.
    s defense. Judgment Branch One of the Revolutionary Court of Arak County
    sentenced Mr. A. A. to death. This verdict was approved by the Chief
    Public Prosecutor and Mr. A. A. was hanged in the Central Prison of Arak
    County on January 3, 2012.
