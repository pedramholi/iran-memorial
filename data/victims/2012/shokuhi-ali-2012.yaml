    New of execution of Mr. Ali Shokuhi was published on the weblog of Human
    Rights Activists for Democracy in Iran on April 23, 2012. Mr. Shokuhi was
    26 years old and his case was related to drug offenses. Arrest and
    detention There is no information on the arrest of Mr. Shokuhi, but he was
    in Qezelhesar Prison for almost a year. Trial No information is available
    on Mr. Shokhui s trial. Charges Mr. Shokuhi was charged with possession of
    25 grams of crystal . The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Shokuhi s defense. Judgment There is no information on
    the verdict leading to this execution. Mr. Ali Shokuhi was hanged in Evin
    Prison in the morning of Monday, April 23, 2012. He was taken from
    Qezelhesar Prison to a solitary confinement in Evin Prison a day prior to
    his execution.
