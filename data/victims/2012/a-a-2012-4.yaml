    The news of Mr. A. A. s execution along with two others was announced by
    the websites of Mehr News which quoted the Public Relations Section of the
    provincial Ministry of Justice office in Semnan, IRNA (the Islamic
    Republic News Agency), and Aftab. The news of this execution along with
    three other cases was also announced by the website of Iran Human Rights
    on July 11, 2012. Mr. A. A. s case as well as those of two others pertains
    to drug trafficking. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of Mr. A. A. s
    arrest and detention are not known. Trial Mr. A. A. was tried by the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Semnan. However, there is no information
    available on the session or sessions of Mr. A. A. s trial. Charges The
    Public Relations Section of the provincial Ministry of Justice office in
    Semnan charged Mr. A. A. with storing and carrying a large amount of
    narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to
    death following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law imposing
    mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession of
    specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and
    more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. A. A. Defense Mr. A. A. appealed for amnesty
    twice, but the central committee rejected his appeals. There is no
    information available on his defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Court of Semnan Province sentenced Mr. A. A. to death. The verdict was
    approved by the Chief Public Prosecutor and head of the Judiciary. Mr. A.
    A. was hanged in Semnan Prison along with two others on the morning of
    Monday, July 11, 2012.
