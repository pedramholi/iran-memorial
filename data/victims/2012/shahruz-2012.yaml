    News of the execution of Mr. Shahruz (last name unknown) along with two
    others was published by various sources including the newspapers Iran
    (October 25, 2012,) and Farhikhtegan (October 26, 2012,) the Human Rights
    Activists News Agency (October 25, 2012,) and Human Rights Activists for
    Democracy in Iran (October 24, 2012.) According to existing information,
    his case was related to the kidnapping and molestation [rape] of eight
    young schoolboys in the east of Tehran (Farhikhtegan.) Mr. Shahruz was 17
    years old when arrested. International laws have strictly prohibited
    capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time
    of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Tehran Police arrested Mr. Shahruz
    on July 5, 2008 based on information provided by plaintiffs
    (Farhikhtegan.) He was detained in the Section Five youth wing of Raja
    ishahr Prison in Karaj for four years (Human Rights Activists for
    Democracy in Iran.) The circumstances of his arrest and detention are not
    known. Trial Branch 79 of the Criminal Court in Tehran tried Mr. Shahruz
    (Farhikhtegan.) No information is available on his trial. Charges The
    charges brought against Mr. Shahruz were announced as kidnapping and
    molestation [rape]. He was accused of kidnapping high school students in
    the east of Tehran using a motorcycle and molesting [raping] them in the
    forested area outside Tehran. He then threatened them into silence (Iran
    newspaper.) The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences, against their opponents (including political, civil
    society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and religious
    minorities.) Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted and executed
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to
    existing information, Mr. Shahruz s confession and complaints by victims
    families were the main reasons for his conviction. He had confessed to the
    molestation of eight male students (Farhikhtegan.) International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense
    Mr. Shahruz claimed to be innocent during his preliminary interrogation
    (Farhikhtegan.) He was younger than 18 when the crime took place (Iran
    newspaper.) No information is available on his defense. Judgment Branch 79
    of the Criminal Court in Tehran condemned Mr. Shahruz to death and Branch
    27 of the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling (Farhikhtegan.) He was
    hanged, along with two others, at Raja ishahr Prison in Karaj on October
    24, 2012.
