    She was an avid reader. She read The Little Prince, for example, and knew
    Ahmad Shamlu s poems by heart. News of Ms. Safieh Ghafuri s execution was
    published in Iran and Sharq newspapers (July 14, 2012). Additional
    information about this case was obtained from the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center s interview with a person with knowledge of the case (June 13,
    2018), Sharq newspaper (July 1 and 11, 2012), Iran newspaper (July 14,
    2012), Mehr News Agency (July 11, 2012), Rahsa News Website (July 10,
    2012), and Mr. Mohammad Mostafai s weblog (July 12, 2012). Ms. Ghafuri was
    28 years old and from the village of Chahvarz, Lamard County, Fars
    Province. She was a married homemaker, and was pregnant at the time of her
    arrest. She was a beautiful and intelligent woman, born into a large
    family. Ms. Ghafuri had an eighth grade education but was a very good
    writer and an avid reader. She read The Little Prince, for example, and
    knew Ahmad Shamlu s poems by heart. She was a very hopeful person and very
    much wished to change he life conditions. (Boroumand Center interview).
    When she was 16 years old, she was forced to marry a man from the opposing
    clan as Khunbass (literally meaning enough bloodshed , a tradition among
    the Bakhtiari tribes, among others, whereby the killer s/killers daughter
    or close female relative is married off to the victim s family as a means
    of putting an end to ongoing grudges and bloodshed), following a long and
    protracted tribal conflict which had resulted in the killing of 20 people
    over the years. Ms. Ghafuri then became friends with an influential man, a
    government employee who was the region s Friday Prayer Imam s son-in-law.
    (Boroumand Center interview). Ms. Ghafuri s case is related to a murder
    committed in one of Fars Province s towns in 2006. Arrest and detention
    The authorities arrested Ms. Ghafuri in 2006, about 15 days after the
    discovery of a burnt body in her home. (Boroumand Center interview). The
    authorities took Ms. Ghafuri to the prosecutor s office in [the town of]
    Beyram , Fars Province where she was detained for approximately one month.
    (Boroumand Center interview). Other reports have stated that she was
    detained in a detention center in [the town of] Lameh, and for about 2
    months. (Rahsa News, Mohammad Mostafai s weblog). According to a person
    with knowledge of the case, Ms. Ghafuri had initially (during the first
    phase of interrogations) stated that she had not committed the murder, and
    had named another individual as the principal killer. The interrogators
    subsequently tortured, beat, and repeatedly raped her to force her to
    confess to committing murder. According to the information provided by the
    person with knowledge of the case, she was repeatedly raped by different
    men while in detention undergoing interrogations, which resulted in severe
    internal bleeding, a miscarriage on the spot, and the loss of her two or
    three months old fetus. Ms. Ghafuri was deprived of hygienic and medical
    attention, even of feminine pads. After a month, a man and a woman went to
    visit her in detention and told her they would support her if she
    confessed to having committed the murder. Ms. Ghafuri, who was only 19
    years old at the time, believed their promises, and in order to free
    herself of rape and torture, confessed to the murder. (Boroumand Center
    interview). According to another report, the individuals who went to visit
    Ms. Ghafuri (without a legal warrant) to convince her to confess to
    murder, were [the city of] Shiraz Governor and Fars Province Governor
    General. (Rahsa News). She was repeatedly raped by different men while
    undergoing interrogations in detention, which resulted in a miscarriage
    and the loss of her baby. Ms. Ghafuri was transferred to prison after her
    case was completed. In the 6 years that she was incarcerated, she was
    moved back and forth several times between Shiraz Adelabad Prison and
    Shiraz Reform and Education Center; she spent the last years of her
    incarceration at the Shiraz Reform and Education Center. She had taken up
    acting in the prison theater group and had even received several prizes.
    (Boroumand Center interview). According to available information, since
    Ms. Ghafuri s family believed that she had dishonored the family, they
    considered her and the man with whom she was in a relationship, worthy of
    death, and they had made plans to kill them. One of her brothers fired
    seven shots at the man when he was in the street but the man was only
    wounded, and did not bring a complaint against Ms. Ghafuri s brother
    afterward. Another one of her brothers fired a shot at Ms. Ghafuri s heart
    at the prison visitation hall with a gun that had been made to look like a
    pen. (Boroumand Center interview, Rahsa News, Mohammad Mostafai s weblog,
    Sharq newspaper). After undergoing surgery, she recovered relatively well
    but the bullet remained in her heart tissue until her death sentence was
    carried out. Ms. Ghaffuri once attempted suicide at Adelabad Prison
    because she had been ostr
