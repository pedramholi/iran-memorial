    Asghar Rahimi was a Sunni Kurd of the Safe i religious and memorized 25
    section of the Qur an. His wish was to play one more time with his
    children . News of the execution of Mr. Asghar Rahimi was published in the
    Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) and Roozonline website on
    December 30, 2012. Additional information about this case was drawn from
    research carried out by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF), with
    interviews from ABF with several persons close to Mr. Rahimi and his
    cellmates; a published letter by his cellmates (HRANA April 25, 2014); a
    letter by Sunni clergies to authorities (Jaras on September 18, 2013, and
    Roozonline on September 23, 2013), and several other resources, including
    the Centre for Supporters of Human Rights on May 4, 2014; the website and
    Facebook page of the International Campaign to Support Sunni Prisoners; Al
    Arabiya on September 19, 2013; Sunni News; and YouTube. Mr. Asghar Rahimi,
    26, was married with two young children. He was a Sunni Kurd and lived in
    Sanandaj. He had a technical diploma in high school and worked at his shop
    in the Industrial City of Sanandaj. He had lost his father at the age of
    four. According to his cellmates, Mr. Rahimi was a religious person,
    though not an affiliate of any group or organization. He was a follower of
    theShafeiShafe ireligion and memorized 25 sections of the Qur an.
    According to a person close to him, his main activities took place at the
    Masjeolnabi [Mosque] in Sanandaj. In addition to teaching Qur an at the
    Mosque, he taught ideological courses about avoiding state control and
    intervention at his house. He and other Sunni prisoners who were condemned
    to death, performed their religious activities in their mosques and
    quarters. Among these activities were to distribute pamphlets and CD s
    regarding Shi a authorities insults of Sunni beliefs. They promoted Shafe
    i beliefs among Sunnis and tried to avoid taking advantage of the
    religion. (Centre for Supporters of Human Rights on May 04, 2014) In
    addition to Mr. Asghar Rahimi, four other members of his family were also
    arrested for similar charges, including his older brother, Mohammad-Yavar,
    and three of his cousins. His other cousin was shot to death during an
    arrest attempt. According to his cellmates, Mr. Rahimi had no regular
    opportunity to visit his family and children, due to the long distance
    between Sanandaj and Raja ishahr Prison in Karaj. He was suffering from
    being so far away from his children. He learned knitting at the prison and
    knitted clothes for his daughter. His wish was to play one more time with
    his children and spend a whole night with them. (ABF research) Human
    rights organizations have protested the death sentences against these
    Sunni activists and due process violations in their cases. Nineteen human
    rights organizations issued statements objecting to these sentences and
    demanding their annulment. (June 20, 2014) Sunni religious leaders, such
    as Molavi Abdolhamid, Friday Emam of Zahedan, and Hassan Amini, Director
    of the Emam Bokhara religious school in Sanandaj, issued open letters to
    the Supreme Leader and heads of the executive, judicial, and legislative
    branches of the Islamic Republic of Iran, calling for the annulment of the
    death penalty for Sunni prisoners. (Al Arabiya, September 19, 2013) Arrest
    and detention Mr. Asghar Rahimi was arrested by agents of the Information
    Ministry, along with another defendant in this case, Shahram Ahmadi, while
    leaving the Masjeolnabi [Mosque] in Sanandaj on April 26, 2009. The arrest
    of these defendants was injured with shooting that resulted in the injury
    of Mr. Ahmadi. A year after the arrest, Mr. Rahimi s brother,
    Mohammad-Yavar, was also arrested for similar charges. Mr. Rahimi spent 24
    months in solitary confinement at the Information Ministry detention
    centers in Sanandaj, Hamedan, and Tehran. He was frequently tortured
    physically and psychologically during his detention period. According to
    his cellmates, his interrogators used electric shocks, applied lashing,
    and threat in order to get him to confess to having links to extremist
    groups whose goal was to overthrow the regime. (ABF research) Mr. Rahimi
    had no access to an attorney, nor any visitation with his family during
    his interrogation. Except for a few times, they did not allow him to call
    his family either. In February of 2012, he and other Sunni prisoners were
    transferred to Raja ishahr Prison and later to Qezelhesar Prison on
    November 13, 2012 Trial Branch 28 of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of
    Tehran tried Mr. Asghar Rahimi and nine other co-defendants in a closed
    session on February 12, 2011. Based on the testimony of four defendants,
    they were not allowed to choose their defense attorneys. Each met the
    attorney assigned to him less than half an hour before the trial was to
    sign his engagement letter. The defendants were taken to court and tried
    while handcuffed, shackled, and blindfolded. The session lasted only 10
    minutes. (A letter sen
