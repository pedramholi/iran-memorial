    The news of Mr. J. Sh. Arak s execution and that of another person was
    announced on the website of the provincial Ministry of Justice office of
    Markazi Province. The ISNA bureau of Markazi Province also quoted the
    announcement from the public relations section of the provincial Ministry
    of Justice office of Markazi Province on January 3, 2012. Mr. J. Sh. Arak
    s case concerns drug trafficking. Arrest and Detention The circumstances
    of Mr. J. Sh. Arak s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Mr. J. Sh.
    Arak was tried by Branch Two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Arak
    County. However, there is no information available on the session or
    sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. J. Sh. Arak was charged with keeping
    and carrying narcotics. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    Guilt Possessing two kilograms and five hundred grams of compressed heroin
    was entered as evidence against Mr. J. Sh. Arak. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mr. J. Sh. Arak s defense. Judgment Branch Two of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Arak County sentenced Mr. J. Sh. Arak to
    death. The verdict was approved by the Chief Public Prosecutor. Mr. Mr. J.
    Sh. Arak was hanged to death in Arak Central Prison on Tuesday, January 3,
    2012.
