    Mr. Hushyar Mohammadi was a computer student and the only son of his
    farming family living at Shirkesh Village in Bijar. News of the execution
    of Mr. Hushyar Mohammadi was published in the Human Rights Activists News
    Agency (HRANA) and Roozonline website on December 30, 2012. Additional
    information about this case was drawn from research carried out by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF), with interviews from ABF with
    several persons close to Mr. Mohammadi and his cellmates; a published
    letter by his cellmates (HRANA April 25, 2014); a letter by Sunni clergies
    to authorities (Jaras on September 18, 2013, and Roozonline on September
    23, 2013), and several other resources, including the Centre for
    Supporters of Human Rights on May 4, 2014; the website and Facebook page
    of the International Campaign to Support Sunni Prisoners; Al Arabiya on
    September 19, 2013; Sunni News; and YouTube. Mr. Hushyar Mohammadi, 24,
    was single and a computer student at Kurdestan University. He was a Sunni
    Kurd and the only son of his farmer family living at Shirkesh village in
    Bijar. According to his cellmates, he was calm, cheerful, and reserved. He
    spent most of his time reading the Qur an and studied his university
    courses. According to his cellmates, Mr. Mohammadi was a religious person,
    though not an affiliate of any group or organization. He was a follower of
    the Shafei religion and memorized 15 sections of the Qur an. He and other
    Sunni prisoners who were condemned to death, performed their religious
    activities in their mosques and quarters. Among these activities were to
    distribute pamphlets and CD s regarding Shi a authorities insults of Sunni
    beliefs. They promoted Shafe i beliefs among Sunnis and tried to avoid
    taking advantage of the religion. (Centre for Supporters of Human Rights
    on May 04, 2014) Human rights organizations have protested the death
    sentences against these Sunni activists and due process violations in
    their cases. Nineteen human rights organizations issued statements
    objecting to these sentences and demanding their annulment. (June 20,
    2014) Sunni religious leaders, such as Molavi Abdolhamid, Friday Emam of
    Zahedan, and Hassan Amini, Director of the Emam Bokhara religious school
    in Sanandaj, issued open letters to the Supreme Leader and heads of the
    executive, judicial, and legislative branches of the Islamic Republic of
    Iran, calling for the annulment of the death penalty for Sunni prisoners.
    (Al Arabiya, September 19, 2013) Arrest and detention Mr. Hushyar
    Mohammadi was arrested by agents of the Intelligence Ministry while
    working on his father s land on September 19, 2009. He was transferred to
    the detention center of Information Administration in Sanandaj. He spent
    nineteen months in solitary confinement at the Information Ministry
    detention centers in Sanandaj, Hamedan, and Tehran. He was frequently
    tortured physically and psychologically during his detention period.
    According to his cellmates, his interrogators used electric shocks,
    applied lashing, and threat in order to get him to confess to having links
    to extremist groups whose goal was to overthrow the regime. (ABF research)
    Mr. Mohammadi had no access to an attorney, nor any visitation with his
    family during his interrogation. Except for a few times, they did not
    allow him to call his family either. In February of 2012, he and other
    Sunni prisoners were transferred to Raja ishahr Prison and later to
    Qezelhesar Prison on November 13, 2012 Trial Branch 28 of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Tehran tried Mr. Hushyar Mohammadi and nine other
    co-defendants in a closed session on February 12, 2011. Based on the
    testimony of four defendants, they were not allowed to choose their
    defense attorneys. Each met the attorney assigned to him less than half an
    hour before the trial was to sign his engagement letter. The defendants
    were taken to court and tried while handcuffed, shackled, and blindfolded.
    The session lasted only 10 minutes. (A letter sent by four cellmates of
    Mr. Mohammadi to the international community and the website of Sunni
    Prisoners) According to several defendants, the judge did not question
    defendants and had a vulgar and insulting behavior toward them. (A
    defendant s will - ABF research) Charges Based on the testimony of four
    defendants, Mr. Mohammadi and his co-defendants were accused of waging war
    against God, through links to Salafi mini-groups and propaganda against
    the regime, through participating in ideological and political classes
    andpossessing, selling, and buying books and CDs of speeches related to
    Sunni beliefs. (Letter to Ban Ki-moon, September 2012 - ABF research) The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against the defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt No information is available regarding the evidence
    provided against Mr. Mohammadi. However, according to the testimony of the
    defendants, the confessions coerced during interrogations were
