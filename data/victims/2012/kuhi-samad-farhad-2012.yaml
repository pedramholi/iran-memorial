    News of the execution of Mr. Samad ( Farhad, last name unknown,) along
    with two others was published by various sources including the newspapers
    Iran (October 25, 2012) and Farhikhtegan (October 26, 2012.) According to
    the existing information, his case was related to the murder of a
    middle-aged man in Shahriyar, Tehran, on April 7, 2004 (Farhikhtegan.) Mr.
    Samad (Farhad) was 16 years old at the time of the incident. International
    laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against those who were
    under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the
    Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of
    the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an
    offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Police

    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the existing information, Mr.
    Samad (Farhad) s confession was the main reason for his conviction. (Iran
    newspaper) International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Samad (Farhad) was younger
    than 18 when the murder took place. No information is available on his
