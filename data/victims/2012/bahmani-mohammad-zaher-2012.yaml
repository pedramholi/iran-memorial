    Mr. Bahmani had lost his father during childhood and had worked at a
    turnery [workshop] in Marivan. He was a seminary student in Sanandaj and
    had memorized all of the Qur an. News of the execution of Mr. Mohammad
    Zaher Bahmani was published in the Human Rights Activists News Agency
    (HRANA) and Roozonline website on December 30, 2012. Additional
    information about this case was drawn from research carried out by the
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF), with interviews from ABF with
    several persons close to Mr. Bahmani and his cellmates; his published
    will; a published letter by his cellmates (HRANA April 25, 2014); a letter
    by Sunni clergies to authorities (Jaras on September 18, 2013, and
    Roozonline on September 23, 2013), and several other resources, including
    the Centre for Supporters of Human Rights on May 4, 2014; the website and
    Facebook page of the International Campaign to Support Sunni Prisoners; Al
    Arabiya on September 19, 2013; Sunni News; and YouTube. Mr. Bahmani, 23,
    was single, a high school graduate, and a Sunni Kurd who lived in
    Sanandaj. He had lost his father during childhood and worked at his
    brother s turnery workshop in Marivan. He memorized the Qur an, was a
    seminary student, and was a religious activist in Sanandaj. According to
    his cellmates, he managed religious classes at the Qoba Mosque.
    Additionally, he managed to hold some secret religious classes -- without
    state supervision -- in defense of Sunni beliefs among the workers in the
    area. Promotion and distribution of the book, Sireh-ie Sahabeh, was also
    one of his activities. According to his cellmates, Mr. Bahmani was not an
    affiliate of any group or organization. He was steady, generous, and
    self-contained. He spent most of his time in prison reading Qur an and
    religious books, having memorized the Qur an during his detention period
    of a year and a half. Wishing to fulfill his mother s desires, he was
    compassionate and confidential toward people close to him and faced
    difficulties with patience in such a way that others were impressed.
    (Interview with ABF) Mr. Bahmani and other Sunni prisoners who were
    condemned to death, performed their religious activities in their mosques
    and quarters. Among these activities were to distribute pamphlets and CD s
    regarding Shi a authorities insults of Sunni beliefs. They promoted Shafe
    i beliefs among Sunnis and tried to avoid taking advantage of the
    religion. (Centre for Supporters of Human Rights on May 04, 2014) Human
    rights organizations have protested the death sentences against these
    Sunni activists and due process violations in their cases. Nineteen human
    rights organizations issued statements objecting to these sentences and
    demanding their annulment. (June 20, 2014) Sunni religious leaders, such
    as Molavi Abdolhamid, Friday Emam of Zahedan, and Hassan Amini, Director
    of the Emam Bokhara religious school in Sanandaj, issued open letters to
    the Supreme Leader and heads of the executive, judicial, and legislative
    branches of the Islamic Republic of Iran, calling for the annulment of the
    death penalty for Sunni prisoners. (Al Arabiya, September 19, 2013) Arrest
    and detention Mr. Mohammad Zaher Bahmani was arrested by agents of the
    Information Ministry while returning from his brother s house in Sanandaj
    on November 11, 2009. He was transferred to the detention center of
    Information Administration in Sanandaj. He spent fifteen months in
    solitary confinement at the Information Ministry detention centers in
    Sanandaj, Hamedan, and Tehran. According to his will, Mr. Bahmani was
    frequently tortured, physically and psychologically, during his detention
    period. In addition, his family suffered the pressure imposed by the
    interrogators. According to one cellmate, Mr. Bahmani was so severely
    tortured because he was an active religious student. His interrogators
    beat him up, insulted him, used electric shocks, applied lashing, and
    keeping his hands and feet cuffed to his cell, in order to get him to
    confess to having links to extremist groups, whose goal was to overthrow
    the regime. (ABF research) Mr. Bahmani had no access to an attorney, nor
    any visitation with his family during his interrogation. In February of
    2012, he and other Sunni prisoners were transferred to Raja ishahr Prison
    and, later, to Qezelhesar Prison on November 13, 2012. Trial Branch 28 of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran tried Mr. Mohammad Zaher Bahmani
    and nine other co-defendants in a closed session on February 12, 2011.
    Based on the testimony of four defendants, they were not allowed to choose
    their defense attorneys. Each met the attorney assigned to him less than
    half an hour before the trial was to sign his engagement letter. Mr.
    Bahmani and other defendants were taken to court and tried, while
    handcuffed, shackled, and blindfolded. The session lasted only 10 minutes.
    (A letter sent by four cellmates of Mr. Bahmani to the international
    community and the website of Sunni Prisoners) According to several
    defendants,
