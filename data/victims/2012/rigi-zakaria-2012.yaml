    He was a single, 21-year-old Sunni Moslem of Baluch ethnicity from the
    city of Zahedan. He was protective of other people s rights and could not
    stand to see them be subjected to injustice. News of Mr. Zakaria Rigi s
    death was reported to the Boroumand Center on January 18, 2018, by one of
    his relatives. Additional information was given to the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center in the course of an interview with this person, who has
    knowledge of the case. Mr. Zakaria Rigi, child of Mohammad Azim and Mehri,
    was a single, 21 year-old-man at the time of his arrest. He was a Sunni
    Moslem and an ethnic Baluch from the city of Zahedan. He had three
    brothers and was the family s second child. Mr. Rigi was an intelligent,
    kind, and religious man who had grown up in a religious family. His father
    had a high school diploma and owned a stationery store in [the town of]
    Mirjaveh. He had lived with his maternal grandparents in Zahedan ever
    since he was an adolescent. Mr. Rigi was a high school student majoring in
    mathematics and physics, and spent time at the local mosque teaching the
    Koran. His behavior and conduct were exemplary. He was a good student and
    would always get a high ranking at school with a good grade point average.
    According to people close to him, he was protective of other people s
    rights and could not stand to see them be subjected to injustice. Mr. Rigi
    s case was related to the killing of a man in the course of a mass
    altercation at a mosque in Zahedan, but he died in custody. Arrest and
    detention On February 12, 2006 (approximate date), Mr. Rigi went to the
    tribe s elder for consultation upon his father s recommendation and
    accompanied by him, and subsequently turned himself in to Mirjaveh police.
    Mr. Rigi had told his friends that he did not wish the murder victim s
    blood to have been spilled in vain [and for the killing to go unpunished],
    and had therefore turned himself in to the Mirjaveh Police. He was
    subsequently taken to the Zahedan Criminal Investigations Bureau located
    at Shahnaz Alley. He came face to face with the victim s parents at the
    Zahedan Criminal Investigations Bureau and told them: I am at your
    disposal. Do whatever you want with me and whatever you think is
    expedient. According to a person with knowledge of the case, Mr. Rigi had
    been treated well at the Zahedan Criminal Investigations Bureau because he
    had confessed everything. The head of the Bureau had told him we have
    conducted investigations and we know you were not alone and had asked him
    to name his friends, but Mr. Rigi had said that he had acted alone. Mr.
    Rigi was taken to Zahedan Central Prison two days later, where he was
    incarcerated for six years. He was allowed to visit with his mother after
    a month for fifteen minutes. He had worn black clothing and had grown a
    beard; he looked so frail and weak that his mother didn t recognize him.
    His hands were severely shaking. He asked his mother to pray for him and
    told her that he had started to re-read the Koran. The head of the prison
    s Information Protection Section hit him in the head with an electric club
    and threw him in a solitary confinement cell as he was bleeding profusely
    from the head. Mr. Rigi was kept at Zahedan Central Prison s Ward 6. He
    was the prison mosque s prayer leader and taught the Koran there, which
    required him to always be ablated, a difficult task as the prison water
    was always cold. According to available information, Mr. Rigi did not have
    many amenities in prison. He and the other prisoners were forced to
    procure their necessities on their own. He was not allowed to make
    sufficient use of the telephone and the authorities would sometimes cut
    off his phone access. Prison officials had once beaten him so badly that
    his kidneys had been hurt. His family had gone to the Judiciary Branch in
    Tehran and requested that he be allowed to be sent to the hospital for
    treatment, but the Zahedan Revolutionary Court had prevented his dispatch
    to the hospital in spite of a letter [from the Judiciary Branch] to that
    effect. His family would obtain his medication but even then, they were
    not given to him on time. Mr. Rigi thought about the people around him and
    was helpful to others. That was why he had a good reputation among the
    prisoners. If he got any money from his family, he would share it with the
    prisoners in need. Mr. Rigi was persecuted by prison authorities during
    his incarceration. For instance, they had put pressure on him to shave his
    beard off and had put limits on his attendance at the mosque. According to
    a person close to him, the main reason for the persecution was that he was
    an adherent of Sunni Islam. According to information available from
    various prisons in different time periods, Sunni Moslem prisoners are
    sometimes discriminated against. They are persecuted because of their
    appearance, which is in line with their religion s requirements, and for
    performing their religious rites; the authorities force them to trim their
    beards by insulting t
