    I have threatening calls day and night, as if we have to shut our mouths
    as soon as they say so. I, as an Iranian, say that I can t stay silent in
    the face of all this tragedy." The news that Mr. Sattar Beheshti was
    murdered while in custody was announced by different sources including
    HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) (November 6, 2012) and Kaleme
    website (November 6, 2012). The additional information about this
    extrajudicial murder has been obtained from the interviews of Mr. Beheshti
    s lawyer with the media, interviews of his family, the report of National
    Security Commission of the Iranian Parliament, the announcement of
    Prosecutor s Office of Tehran, the interview of the speaker of the
    Judiciary, and other sources.* Mr. Sattar Beheshti was a bachelor blogger
    from Robat Karim. He had a middle school education and was a simple day
    laborer who lived with his mother in a slum in Robat Karim. He was the
    breadwinner and legal guardian of his old and sick mother. According to
    Sattar s mother, he loved a simple life and always said, It doesn t matter
    how long you live, and any person should have a fruitful life. He said,
    Why do some people have so much money that they don t know what to do with
    it and some others have a difficult life? Mr. Beheshti was the admin of
    Criticism. Long live Iranians and Iran I sacrifice myself for Iran . He
    performed most of his activities on social networks such as Facebook ,
    Google Plus , and his own weblog using an alias. He posted and commented
    on materials and news about political prisoners and cases of human rights
    violations of the Islamic Republic in his weblog and objected to the
    tyranny and the widespread corruption of the government. He also fiercely
    criticized the regime s officials by quoting their statements. He
    mentioned being threatened in the last post he sent on his weblog on
    October 29, 2012 and wrote, I have threatening calls day and night, as if
    we have to shut our mouths as soon as they say so. I, as an Iranian, say
    that I can t stay silent in the face of all this tragedy. I say that you
    gentlemen talk too much and have led the country to destruction with all
    this nonsense. I won t stop talking, even if it means that I will die.
    Wherever I am, I don t care about the threats from anybody. You gentlemen
    shut your mouth, do not be cruel or we will expose you. Mr. Sattar
    Beheshti s death in custody provoked many reactions nationally and
    internationally. Amnesty International (November 8, 29, and December 13,
    2012), Human Rights Watch (November 9, 2012 and March 7, 2013), Reporters
    Without Borders, Committee to Protect Journalists (November 10, 2012), the
    United States Department of State and the European Union issued
    announcements demanding that Islamic Republic officials carry out an
    investigation and explain his death. Civil society organizations and
    political groups including Islamic Iran Participation Front, Alumni
    Organization of University Students (Advar-e Tahkim-e Vahdat) and Assembly
    of Qom Seminary Scholars also issued some announcements stating that this
    murder was a felony, condemning the continuing murder of political
    protestors and critics and demanding an end to torture in detention
    centers and prisons. Following these reactions, the special committee of
    investigation of Sattar Beheshti s death was formed in Islamic
    Consultative Assembly. A number of the witnesses of this case who agreed
    to testify formally, were followed and subjected to judicial harassment.
    Among those was Mr. Beheshti s doctor in the Evin Prison clinic, Mr. Reza
    Heidarpur, who was arrested by Ministry of Intelligence agents and was
    sentenced to six months of imprisonment in branch 28 of the Islamic
    Revolutionary court ( Kaleme , Jun 1, 2016). One of the political
    prisoners in ward 350 of Evin Prison who had testified in favor of Sattar
    Beheshti in his interview with the investigating judge of the case, was
    later exiled to Karun Prison in Ahvaz, which has harsh conditions, in
    order to be punished, although the judge had guaranteed that he would not
    be penalized ( Kaleme , November 11, 2013). According to Saham news , Mr.
    Beheshti was also arrested during the protests in the Tehran University
    dormitory in 1999. Arrest and detention Mr. Sattar Beheshti was arrested
    in his mother s house located in Robat Karim by the FATA Police- Iranian
    Cyber Police - agents on October 30, 2012. The agents didn t show any
    warrant to him. According to Mr. Beheshti s mother, when she asked the
    undercover agents to show her a warrant, they showed her their guns. The
    officials statement about the existence of an arrest warrant is
    contradicted. Ali Motahari, a member of the Iranian parliament from Tehran
    and Robat Karim, in a formal session in the Islamic Consultative Assembly
    announced that according to his investigations, the arrest of Mr. Beheshti
    was done without any court orders. But according to the parliamentary
    committee and the statement of the speaker of Judiciary, the arrest of Mr.
