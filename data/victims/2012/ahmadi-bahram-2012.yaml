    At the time of his arrest, Bahram was only 17. His main activity was to
    distribute CDs, which drew attention to insulting statements against Sunni
    beliefs by Shi a religious figures. News of the execution of Mr. Bahram
    Ahmadi was published in Roozonline on December 30, 2012. Additional
    information about his case was drawn from his recorded audio will,
    testimonies from his relatives and cellmates, published letters from his
    cellmates (HRANA April 25, 2014), letters from his parents to authorities
    (HRANA February 25, 2014), letters from Sunni clergies to authorities
    (Jaras September 18, 2013 and Tabesh September 26, 2013), Centre for
    Supporters of Human Rights on May 04, 2014, and several other sources.
    Bahram Ahmadi lived in the town of Sanandaj in Kurdistan and was the ninth
    and last child in his family. He was studying math at Azadegan-e Baharan
    High School in Sanandaj. His father was a laborer. According to his
    father, Mr. Ahmadi s activities started at school, and in the mosque, in
    2006. His goal was to help those who were poor and to raise awareness
    among people regarding the regime s injustice. According to a person close
    to him, Mr. Ahmadi s main activity was to distribute CDs, which drew
    attention to insulting statements against Sunni beliefs by Shi a religious
    figures, but he didn t belong to any specific group. Mr. Ahmadi
    co-defendants state that they are followers of the Shafi i school of
    thought in Sunni Islam, and they promoted their beliefs in the region.
    They also tried to raise awareness so that the population is not exploited
    in the name of religion. (Centre for Supporters of Human Rights, May 4,
    2014) People close to him remember Mr. Ahmadi as calm, kind, and
    studious.When a new prisoner came to his ward, he would try to help
    procure some basic supplies to make the first days of prison less hard. He
    liked Kurdish ethnic food. Yogurt soup was one of his favorites. Human
    rights organizations have protested the death sentences against these
    Sunni activists and due process violations in their cases. Sunni religious
    leaders, such as Molavi Abdolhamid, Friday Emam of Zahedan, and Hassan
    Amini, Director of the Emam Bokhara religious school in Sanandaj, issued
    open letters to the leaders and heads of the executive, judicial, and
    legislative branches of the Islamic Republic of Iran, calling for the
    annulment of the death penalty for Sunni prisoners. ( Al Arabiya ,
    September 19, 2013) Arrest and detention Mr. Ahmadi was arrested on
    September 19, 2009, in his family home in Sanandaj by agents of the
    Ministry of Intelligence, who did not show any arrest warrant. He was
    seventeen years old. His older brother Shahram had been arrested four
    months earlier. Mr. Ahmadi spent seventeen months in solitary confinement
    at the Intelligence Ministry detention centers in Sanandaj, Hamedan, and
    Tehran. During his detention period, Mr. Ahmadi was frequently tortured.
    He told his cellmates that his interrogators used electric shocks,
    lashing, food deprivation, and threats against his family, in order to get
    him to confess to having links to extremist groups whose goal was to
    overthrow the regime. Interrogators also insulted and demeaned Mr. Ahmadi
    as a Sunni and attacked his religious beliefs. Mr. Ahmadi had no access to
    an attorney or visitation with his family during his interrogation. Except
    for a few times, they did not allow him to call his family either. In
    March 2011, Mr. Ahmadi was transferred to Ward 1 of Raja i Shahr Prison,
    where ordinary prisoners, charged with serious offenses, are held. In
    February 2012, he and other Sunni prisoners were transferred to Ward 4,
    Room 10, until November 13, 2012 when he was transferred to Qezelhesar
    Prison. Trial Mr. Ahmadi and nine other co-defendants were tried in Branch
    28 of the revolutionary court on February 12, 2011. Based on the testimony
    of four defendants tried along with Mr. Ahmadi, they were not allowed to
    choose their defense attorneys. They met the attorney assigned to them
    less than half an hour before the trial to sign his engagement letter. The
    attorney strongly recommended that the defendants accept the charges
    against them, with the promise that they would be transferred to their
    home town, Sanandaj, and eventually released. Mr. Ahmadi and other
    defendants were taken to court and tried while handcuffed, shackled, and
    blindfolded. The session lasted 10 minutes, and the judge did not question
    defendants, nor ask them to make statements in their own defense. In his
    will, Mr. Ahmadi noted the vulgar and insulting behavior of the judge.
    (Mr. Ahmadi s will - ABF research) Charges Based on the available
    information, Mr. Ahmadi and his co-defendants were accused of waging war
    against God, through links to Salafi mini-groups and propaganda against
    the regime, through participating in ideological and political classes,
    possessing, selling, and buying books and CDs of speeches related to Sunni
    beliefs. (Letter to Ban Ki-moon, September 2012 - ABF research) The vali
