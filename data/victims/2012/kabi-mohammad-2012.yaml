    Information about Mr. Mohammad Ka bi was taken from an announcement of
    Human Rights Watch (2/7/2012), the Justice for Iran Organization
    (2/20/2012), Roozonline (6/26/2012) and Deutsche Welle Farsi (2/4/2013).
    Additional information about these protests has been gathered from
    interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation, with several
    eyewitnesses and from a report by Milan Kothari, the UN Special Rapporteur
    on the Right to Adequate Housing, as well as reports by Amnesty
    International, Human Rights Watch, Ahvaz Human Rights Organization, Ahvaz
    News Agency, Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA), Islamic Republic News
    Agency (IRNA), and news websites including the BBC and Gooya News.* Mr.
    Mohammad Ka bi, 35, was married with two children, five and eight years
    old. He was a law student at Azad University in Dezful. Mr. Ka bi was a
    farmer and a resident of Ahmadabad in Shush. ( Justice for Iran ) A
    Summary of the Khuzestan Protests Subsequent to the publication of a
    letter dated July 24, 1998, ascribed to then-President Khatami s Chief of
    Staff, Mohammad Ali Abtahi, demonstrations protesting the letter broke out
    on Friday, April 15, 2005, first in [the city of] Ahvaz, and then in other
    cities, such as Mahshahr and Hamidideh, and continued for several days.
    The letter emphasized the modification of Khuzestan Province s ethnic Arab
    population through promotion and encouragement of the migration of
    non-native populations to the province, [thus] reducing Khuzestan s Arab
    population to one third of the total population of the province. Although
    the government s spokesperson officially denied [the existence of] this
    letter on Saturday, April 16, the demonstrations that had been called for
    by the Coordination Committee for Popular Protests in Ahvaz continued
    extensively in the coming days. In calling for demonstrations, [the
    organizers] highlighted various factors, including the central government
    s policies in expropriating Arab farmers lands for various projects such
    as sugar cane development, and marginalization of, as well as profound
    discontent among, Khuzestan s Arab [population], as a result of the regime
    s efforts to obliterate Arab identity. The demonstrations that had started
    in Kui-e Alavi (Shelangabad/Da ereh), one of [the city of] Ahvaz s poor
    neighborhoods, quickly spread to the center of Ahvaz and to the cities of
    Mahshahr and Hamidieh. Citing Ahvaz News (a regional news organization)
    and eyewitnesses at the scene, the Ahvaz Human Rights Organization s
    bulletin, dated April 15, 2005, stated, Around three thousand Arab people
    of Ahvaz have gathered together and started extensive but peaceful
    demonstrations in Kordovani Street and Square, along with thousands of
    others in neighborhoods such as Shelangabad, Malashieh, Ameri, and Kut
    Abdollah, among others. Security forces are attacking the demonstrators,
    first with tear gas, and are subsequently firing on them in Da ereh and
    Malashieh neighborhoods. The degree of violence resorted to by security
    and police forces in quashing the demonstrations was such that it led to
    the death of a number of protestors. Dozens more were injured. Subsequent
    to these deaths, the intensity and magnitude of the protests increased. In
    a number of towns, demonstrators proceeded to cut off roads and to occupy
    government buildings and police posts. These protests continued for ten
    days in many Arab regions of Khuzestan. Protestors demanded a government
    apology to the region s Arabs. Official government sources, quoting the
    Islamic Republic s Defense Minister, announced the death toll as standing
    at three or four. (ISNA, April 19, 2005) Civil society activists, however,
    declared the number of people killed during these events to be between 50
    and 60. Amnesty International stated the number as 29; Human Rights Watch
    , 50; and the Ahvaz Human Rights Organization , 160. Dozens of others were
    injured. The Ahvaz General and Revolutionary Prosecutor s Office announced
    the arrest and arraignment of 447 individuals. (IRNA, April 25, 2005)
    Local sources, however, announced the number as being greater than 1200. A
    number of intellectuals and ethnic leaders were among those arrested.
    Although the demonstrations subsided after ten days, widespread arrests,
    multiple bombings, successive executions, and popular protests continued
    on various occasions, including the anniversary of the events. Related
    Protests in the Following Years In the years since the violent incidents
    of April 15, 2005, the regime s forces have continued to violently
    suppress the peaceful protests of the Arab citizens of Khuzestan Province,
    whenever they occur, including on the anniversary of the protests. Every
    year, as April 15th nears, a wave of arrests takes over the entire region.
    Internet access is cut off, and other means of communication, such as
    telephones, are tapped and strictly controlled by the security apparatus.
    Certain cases of death in suspicious circumstances have even been reported
    by local sour
