    The news of Mr. Ali Alai' s execution along with eight others was
    announced by the website of the Criminal Court of Tehran and the website
    of the Criminal and Revolutionary Court of Tehran (May 6, 2012), Mehr News
    Agency (May 7, 2012), Kayhan daily citing the Judiciary spokesman (May 8,
    2012), and Fars News (May 11, 2012). Mr. Ali Alai' s case as well as those
    of six others pertains to drug trafficking. Arrest and Detention According
    to Mehr News Agency, Mr. Alai' was arrested consequent to the arrest of a
    number of drug dealers. However, there is no information available on the
    details of his arrest and detention. Trial Mr. Alai' was tried by the
    Revolutionary Court of Tehran. However, there is no information available
    on the session or sessions of his trial. Charges Mr. Alai' and six others
    were charged with drug trafficking. According to the report by the website
    of the Criminal and Revolutionary Court of Tehran, the cargo of
    methamphetamine which the traffickers had shaped in the form of pieces of
    stone and was on its way to Southeast Asian countries was confiscated by
    the authorities in the customs office of Shaheed Raja ee in Bandar Abbas.
    The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot
    be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of proscribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt Discovery of 500
    kilograms of methamphetamine was entered as evidence against Mr. Alai' and
    six others. Defense After the trial, Mr. Alai' asked for pardon, but his
    appeal was rejected. He had a defense lawyer, but there is no information
    available on the details of his defense. Judgment The Revolutionary Court
    of Tehran sentenced Mr. Alai' to death. He was hanged in a Tehran prison
    along with eight others on May 6, 2012. His belongings were confiscated by
    the decree of the court.
