    was hanged solely on the basis of his cellphone s contents. Information
    about Mr. Abdorreza Damankeshan s execution was obtained through
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interview with Mr. Damankeshan s attorney
    on August 22, 2016 (ABC interview). The news in this regard was published
    on the websites of Iran Human Rights (May 26, 2012) and Roozonline (May
    27, 2012). Mr. Damankeshan was 32 years old, had obtained a high school
    diploma, and lived in the city of Lar in Fars Province. After finishing
    high school, he was worked in retail in a clothes store in his hometown.
    Mr. Damankeshan s case pertained to sexual offences. Arrest and detention
    Following a lawsuit filed by a woman, Mr. Damankeshan was arrested in the
    city of Lar in August/September 2010. The circumstances of Mr. Damankeshan
    s arrest and detention are not known. Trial The Fars Province Criminal
    Court located in the city of Lar tried Mr. Damankeshan. No information is
    available on his trial. Charges Mr. Damankeshan was charged with rape ,
    kidnapping a woman and filming his sexual relations with her (Roozonline).
    The contents of Mr. Damankeshan s cellphone were used as the sole evidence
    against him. According to the available information, Mr. Damankeshan s
    girlfriend was abused by one of his friends. Therefore, Mr. Damankeshan
    invited his friend's girlfriend to his home to talk to her about the
    incident. She subsequently claimed that she had been raped by Mr.
    Damankeshan (ABC interview). The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against these defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    According to the available information, the contents of Mr. Damankeshan s
    cellphone were used as the sole evidence against him. Mr. Damankeshan had
    several photos on his cellphone with a number of women which were taken
    while he was outside the country. Those photos were introduced as evidence
    of his moral corruption (ABC interview). Another piece of evidence was a
    video file on Mr. Damankeshan s cellphone, which was claimed to depict his
    sexual relations with the complainant (Rooz Online). Defense A few days
    after filing her complaint, the complainant wrote a letter and explicitly
    declared that she had not been raped. She also raised this fact at the
    court session. However, the Criminal Court in Fars Province accused Mr.
    Damankeshan of moral corruption and sentenced him solely on the basis of
    several photos and videos on his cellphone. The video in question did not
    depict sexual relations between the complainant and Mr. Damankeshan,
    however. Based on the forensic medical expert s report and the complainant
    s assertion that rape had not been committed, there were serious doubts as
    to proving the charge of rape. In addition, the forensic medical expert s
    report stated that no indications of rape and use of force and violence
    were found on the complainant s body. Mr. Damankeshan s attorney, in an
    interview with Boroumand Center, stated that while there was no evidence
    against his client, public pressure in the small and religious city of Lar
    and the fact that the case was framed as a public security issue in court
    led to the conviction of his client. Based on the forensic medical expert
    s report and the complainant s assertion that rape had not been committed,
    there were serious doubts as to proving the charge of rape. Therefore,
    according to the jurisprudential principle of dar * and article 121 of
    Islamic Penal Code** the punishment for rape (hadd-e zena) was rendered
    void. Judgment Mr. Damankeshan was acquitted at court for the charge of
    kidnapping . For the charge of filming his sexual relations, Mr.
    Damankeshan was sentenced to eight years in prison, after which the
    appeals court reduced the sentence to three years. On June 22, 2011, the
    Fars Province Criminal Court located in the city of Lar sentenced Mr.
    Damankeshan to public execution on the charge of rape . Following the
    order of the Deputy of the Supreme Court, Branch 13 of the Supreme Court
    reviewed the case urgently and upheld the order of the criminal court on
    August 30, 2011. Mr. Damankeshan s attorney requested for a retrial, and
    the case was again reviewed at Branch 13 of the Supreme Court, and Branch
    13 confirmed its previous ruling. Despite the fact that the Head of the
    Judiciary asked to review the case, the Chief Justice of Fars Province
    executed Mr. Damankeshan. Early morning on Friday, May 25, 2012, Mr.
    Abdorreza Mr. Damankeshan was hanged in front of the prison s door in the
    city of Lar, Fars Province without people s presence. According to Mr.
    Damankeshan s attorney, contrary to the practice of executions in public,
    people were not invited for this execution, and only Mr. Damankeshan s
    family were pre
