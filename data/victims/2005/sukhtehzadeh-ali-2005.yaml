    The information about Mr. Ali Sukhtehzadeh was published in the websites
    of the following newspaper: Sharq (April 3, 2004), Jomhuri Eslami (May 22,
    2004), and Iran (March 15, 2005). Arrest and detention Regarding Mr.
    Sukhtehzadeh’s arrest, the Sharq newspaper reported: The person who shot
    and killed four employees of the Saderat bank and a sandwich vendor in
    Ahvaz was arrested on March 24, 2004, by the Ahvaz intelligent police. at
    the time ofg the arrest, he intended to exchange stolen traveler’s checks
    worth 18 million Tomans for dollars. Trial The Jomhuri Eslami newspaper
    referred to the statements of the head of the judiciary of Khuseztan
    province saying that there were two separate proceedings against the
    defendant at the Islamic Revolutionary Court and the Public Court. He
    added: “the honorable judges speedily issued the necessary and lawful
    sentences.” Charges Mr. Sukhtehzadeh was charged with five counts of
    murder in Ahvaz. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to the Sharq
    newspaper: “During the primary interrogations, the defendant confessed [to
    the crime] and told the detectives that he had murdered the five victims.”
    It should be noted that the same report reminded the readers that there
    had been many uncertainties regarding this case: “Despite the fact that
    the head of the intelligent force of Ahvaz emphasized that the same
    defendant had killed all the victims, many still believe that the crime
    was committed by several persons. [They point out that] although the
    police station 126 is only 400 meters away from the crime scene, no
    officers noticed the 12 shots and the perpetrators easily escaped.”
    International human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the
    government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of
    severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain confessions from
    detainees and have questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained
    under duress. In the case of political detainees, these confessions are,
    at times, televised. The National Television broadcasts confessions during
    which prisoners plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and
    renounce their political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights
    organizations have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by
    those prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Sukhtehzadeh’s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court called
    Mr. Ali Sukhtehzadeh a “corruptor on earth and at war with God” and
    condemned him to death. The Supreme Court approved this sentence ( Jomhuri
    Eslami ). Mr. Sukhtehzadeh was hanged in public and in front of the same
    bank branch on March 13, 2005.
