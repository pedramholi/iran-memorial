    Information regarding Musa Shamusi (an eight-year-old child) has been
    collected from an Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) interview with an
    eyewitness; a list of protestors killed during demonstrations in Ahvaz and
    published on the Ahvaz News Agency website; and another list issued by the
    European Ahwazi Human Rights Organization. Additional information about
    these protests has been gathered from further interviews conducted by ABF
    with several eyewitnesses and from a report by Milan Kothari, the UN
    Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, as well as reports
    from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Ahvaz Human Rights
    Organization, the Ahvaz News Agency, the Iranian Students News Agency
    (ISNA), Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), and news websites including
    the BBC and Gooya News.* According to an ABF interview with one of the
    eyewitnesses of the Ahvaz incidents, Musa was shot and killed by
    plainclothes security forces during protests in Malashieh (in Ahvaz) on
    April 17, 2005, around 6:00 p.m. The Officials Reaction According to one
    of the eyewitnesses, the Shamusi family was not allowed to have a burial
    ceremony for him for two or more days after his death. Iranian state and
    judiciary authorities did not provide clear information regarding the
    number or names of the individuals killed during the Khuzestan protests.
    Some of the state officials acknowledged in a general statement that some
    citizens had been killed but did not provide further information. Ali
    Shamkhani, the Minister of Defense at the time, who was present in
    Khuzestan as the representative of the state, announced the number of
    individuals killed to be three or four (ISNA, April 19, 2005). On April
    20, 2005, 180 members of the seventh parliament wrote a letter to Seyyed
    Mohammad Khatami, Iran s president at the time, to demand restitution for
    the harms brought upon the people of Ahvaz and the release of innocent
    detainees who, according to the parliamentarians, were mostly teenage
    students and young people. In an April 25, 2005 letter to Mohammad
    Khatami, Iran s president at the time, Jasem Shadidzadeh, Secretary
    General of the Wefaq Party and Representative of Ahvaz in the sixth
    parliament, demanded that the bodies of the victims be delivered to their
    families as soon as possible for proper funeral and customary mourning
    ceremonies. According to reports by local activists and human rights
    organizations, such as Amnesty International, security officials gave the
    news of the death of some of the protest detainees to the families. Some
    of the eyewitnesses of the protests explicitly remarked, in their
    interviews with the Boroumand Foundation, that the security forces
    actively prevented the delivery of the victims bodies to their families,
    for quite some time, and had, in some cases, summoned and threatened the
    families. According to a Human Rights Watch report, in some cases the
    officials had demanded that the families pay a 50 million riyal fine
    (later reduced to 15 million riyals) for damage sustained by government
    buildings during the protests, before they could receive the victims
    bodies -- although it is reported that, even after the payment of the fine
    by the families, state officials only allowed the delivery of two bodies
    per week (Human Rights Watch, May 10, 2005). The Family s Remarks No
    information regarding remarks or reactions by Shamusi s family is
    available. A Brief Description of Arab Protests in Khuzestan On Friday,
    April 15, 2005, protests ensued, initially, in the Kui-e Alavi
    (Shelangabad) neighborhood of Ahvaz and continued widely for several days
    to other parts of Ahvaz, Mahshahr, and Hamidiyeh, in response to the
    publication of a July 24, 1998, letter, attributed to Mohammad Ali Abtahi,
    the head of the President s Office at the time, calling for a demographic
    restructuring of the Arab population in Khuzestan, encouraging the
    immigration of non-Arab people to the region, and reducing the Arab
    population of Khuzestan to one-third of the total population of the
    province. Even though, on Saturday, April 16th, the spokesperson for the
    Iranian government officially denied the authenticity of the letter, the
    protests that had ensued, following the invitation of the Committee for
    Organizing Popular Protests in Ahvaz, ** (a committee consisting of some
    political groups, cultural institutions, civil institutions, and some
    Khuzestan Arab political and civil activists) continued widely. In the
    call for protests, the following factors were mentioned: policies by the
    central government to confiscate the lands belonging to Arab farmers,
    through various projects such as the Sugarcane Project; increasing
    marginalization as well as profound dissatisfaction among Khuzestan Arabs
    due to government efforts to eradicate the Arab identity; and uprooting
    the Arabs of Khuzestan. Historical Background Iranian Arabs, some 2 to 3
    million individuals, comprising approximately*** 3% of the country s
    population, reside in Khuze
