    The news of the execution of two juveniles named Mahmud Asgari, 16, and
    Ayaz Marhuni, 18, was published by the Iranian Student News Agency (ISNA,
    July 19, 2005) which mentioned their names as M. A. and A. M. On the same
    date, the Quds newspaper provided a detailed account of the arrest and
    alleged crimes. The case was raised by Human Rights Watch, in a letter
    dated July 27, 2005 to the Iranian president and head of the judiciary. On
    July 26, 2005, the Advocate website also published this news, referring to
    the executions as violations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
    Various other human rights groups have also expressed their objections to
    the executions. A year later, a report regarding this case was released by
    Simon Forbes, a UK-based gay rights activist (see Iranian Queer
    Organization website). This report, Mashhad: Place of Martyrdom, which
    analyzes various documents including evidence collected by the editor of
    Huriyah: A Queer Muslim Magazine , denies the veracity of the rape
    allegation. The report relies on interviews with unidentified individuals
    in Mashhad familiar with the case, as well as different newspaper stories.
    Human Rights Watch argues that the executions of Mr. Asgari and Mr.
    Marhuni were in violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and
    the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, prohibiting the
    imposition of the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of
    eighteen. These treaties also prohibit the use of torture along with
    cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishments. Iran has ratified both treaties.
    Although the exact number of juvenile execution in Iran is unknown, human
    rights activists estimate that 12 juveniles were executed last year.
    According to the Human Rights Watch report, before the two youths were put
    to death, each also received 228 lashes for theft, disturbing public
    order, and consuming alcohol. The two teenagers were ethnic Arabs from
    south west Iran whose families had relocated to Mashhad after the breakout
    of the Iran-Iraq War. They were known to be a gay couple (Mr. Forbes
    report). Arrest and detention The circumstances of arrest and detention
    for Mr. Mahmud Asgari are unknown. ISNA quoted the defendant saying that
    his arrest took place 14 months before his execution (about June 2004).
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The
    main charge against Mr. Mahmud Asgari was the rape of a 13- year-old boy.
    He was also charged with robbery, disturbing public order, and consuming
    alcohol. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. According to ISNA, the defendant confessed to his
    crime in court. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No specific information is
    available on Mr. Asgari s defense. The ISNA report quoted one of the
    defendants stating that they did not know that such action was punishable
    by death. The Advocate quoted the lawyer for Mahmoud Asgari saying that
    Iran s Supreme Court upheld the verdict and allowed the execution despite
    his objections based on the age of his client. He added that Iranian
    courts are supposed to commute death sentences handed to juveniles to five
    years in jail and that the judiciary has trampled on its own laws. Mr.
    Forbes report challenges the rape accusation and claims that the
    teenagers, including the 13-year old boy presented as a rape victim, were
    involved in consensual sex. He refers to the ISNA report quoting one of
    the teenagers who stated that we did not know committing such act is
    punishable by death. Considering the fact that public executions for rape
    are common in Iran, it is likely that the teenagers had confessed to
    consensual homosexual sex, rather than rape. The report also finds
    discrepancies between the gathered testimonies and the official news
    coverage of the story regarding the date and circumstances of the arrest
    of Mr. Marhuni and Mr. Asgari. For example, an official newspaper refers
    to an arrest that took place 16 months before the execution, whereas based
    on the statement of the teenagers themselves they were arrested 14 months
    before their execution. The report attributes the execution to the fact
    that the 13-year old was the son of a high ranking official. Judgment
