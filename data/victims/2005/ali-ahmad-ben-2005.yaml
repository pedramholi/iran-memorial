    Information about Mr. Ahmad Ben Ali was taken from lists of individuals
    killed during protests in Khuzestan, between April 15 th and 24 th , 2005.
    The lists were reported by the Ahvaz News Agency and the European Ahwazi
    Human Rights Organization; they include the names and details of 51 Arab
    citizens of Khuzestan (in the first list) and 64 (in the second) who were
    killed by security and police forces during popular protests in
    Arab-populated town. Additional information about these protests has been
    gathered from interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation, with several eyewitnesses and from a report by Milan Kothari,
    the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, as well as
    reports by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Ahvaz Human Rights
    Organization, Ahvaz News Agency, Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA),
    Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), and news websites including the BBC
    and Gooya News. The Officials Reaction Iranian state and judiciary
    authorities did not provide clear information regarding the number or
    names of the individuals killed during the Khuzestan protests. Some of the
    state officials acknowledged in a general statement that some citizens had
    been killed but did not provide further information. Ali Shamkhani, the
    Minister of Defense at the time, who was present in Khuzestan as the
    representative of the state, announced the number of individuals killed to
    be three or four (ISNA, April 19, 2005). On April 20, 2005, 180 members of
    the seventh parliament wrote a letter to Seyyed Mohammad Khatami, Iran s
    president at the time, to demand restitution for the harms brought upon
    the people of Ahvaz and the release of innocent detainees who, according
    to the parliamentarians, were mostly teenage students and young people. In
    an April 25, 2005 letter to Mohammad Khatami, Iran s president at the
    time, Jasem Shadidzadeh, Secretary General of the Wefaq Party and
    Representative of Ahvaz in the sixth parliament, demanded that the bodies
    of the victims be delivered to their families as soon as possible for
    proper funeral and customary mourning ceremonies. According to reports by
    local activists and human rights organizations, such as Amnesty
    International, security officials gave the news of the death of some of
    the protest detainees to the families. Some of the eyewitnesses of the
    protests explicitly remarked, in their interviews with the Boroumand
    Foundation, that the security forces actively prevented the delivery of
    the victims bodies to their families, for quite some time, and had, in
    some cases, summoned and threatened the families. According to a Human
    Rights Watch report, in some cases the officials had demanded that the
    families pay a 50 million riyal fine (later reduced to 15 million riyals)
    for damage sustained by government buildings during the protests, before
    they could receive the victims bodies -- although it is reported that,
    even after the payment of the fine by the families, state officials only
    allowed the delivery of two bodies per week (Human Rights Watch, May 10,
    2005). The Family s Remarks No information regarding remarks or reactions
    by Mr. Ben Ali s family is available. A Brief Description of Arab Protests
    in Khuzestan On Friday, April 15, 2005, protests ensued, initially, in the
    Kui-e Alavi (Shelangabad) neighborhood of Ahvaz and continued widely for
    several days to other parts of Ahvaz, Mahshahr, and Hamidiyeh, in response
    to the publication of a July 24, 1998, letter, attributed to Mohammad Ali
    Abtahi, the head of the President s Office at the time, calling for a
    demographic restructuring of the Arab population in Khuzestan, encouraging
    the immigration of non-Arab people to the region, and reducing the Arab
    population of Khuzestan to one-third of the total population of the
    province. Even though, on Saturday, April 16th, the spokesperson for the
    Iranian government officially denied the authenticity of the letter, the
    protests that had ensued, following the invitation of the Committee for
    Organizing Popular Protests in Ahvaz, ** (a committee consisting of some
    political groups, cultural institutions, civil institutions, and some
    Khuzestan Arab political and civil activists) continued widely. In the
    call for protests, the following factors were mentioned: policies by the
    central government to confiscate the lands belonging to Arab farmers,
    through various projects such as the Sugarcane Project; increasing
    marginalization as well as profound dissatisfaction among Khuzestan Arabs
    due to government efforts to eradicate the Arab identity; and uprooting
    the Arabs of Khuzestan. Historical Background Iranian Arabs, some 2 to 3
    million individuals, comprising approximately*** 3% of the country s
    population, reside in Khuzestan, Bushehr, Hormozgan, Fars, and Khorasan
    provinces. The largest number of Arabs reside in the Southern and Western
    regions of Khuzestan. Although Khuzestan is a very rich province due to
    oil reserves and fertile farmlands, most
