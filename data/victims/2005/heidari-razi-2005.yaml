    Information about Mr. Razi Heidari was taken from a list of individuals
    killed during protests in Khuzestan, between April 15thand 30th, 2005. The
    list was reported by the European Ahwazi Human Rights Organization, which
    includes the names and details of 64 Arab citizens of Khuzestan, who were
    killed by security and police forces during popular protests in
    Arab-populated towns. Additional information about these protests has been
    gathered from interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Foundation, with several eyewitnesses and from a report by Milan Kothari,
    the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, as well as
    reports by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Ahvaz Human Rights
    Organization, Ahvaz News Agency, Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA),
    Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), and news websites including the BBC
    and Gooya News.* Based on the available information, Mr. Heidari, a
    seventeen-year-old, was killed in April 2005 by security and police forces
    during protests in the city of Ahvaz. The Officials Reaction Iranian state
    and judiciary authorities did not provide clear information regarding the
    number or names of the individuals killed during the Khuzestan protests.
    Some of the state officials acknowledged in a general statement that some
    citizens had been killed but did not provide further information. Ali
    Shamkhani, the Minister of Defense at the time, who was present in
    Khuzestan as the representative of the state, announced the number of
    individuals killed to be three or four (ISNA, April 19, 2005). On April
    20, 2005, 180 members of the seventh parliament wrote a letter to Seyyed
    Mohammad Khatami, Iran s president at the time, to demand restitution for
    the harms brought upon the people of Ahvaz and the release of innocent
    detainees who, according to the parliamentarians, were mostly teenage
    students and young people. In an April 25, 2005 letter to Mohammad
    Khatami, Iran s president at the time, Jasem Shadidzadeh, Secretary
    General of the Wefaq Party and Representative of Ahvaz in the sixth
    parliament, demanded that the bodies of the victims be delivered to their
    families as soon as possible for proper funeral and customary mourning
    ceremonies. According to reports by local activists and human rights
    organizations, such as Amnesty International, security officials gave the
    news of the death of some of the protest detainees to the families. Some
    of the eyewitnesses of the protests explicitly remarked, in their
    interviews with the Boroumand Foundation, that the security forces
    actively prevented the delivery of the victims bodies to their families,
    for quite some time, and had, in some cases, summoned and threatened the
    families. According to a Human Rights Watch report, in some cases the
    officials had demanded that the families pay a 50 million riyal fine
    (later reduced to 15 million riyals) for damage sustained by government
    buildings during the protests, before they could receive the victims
    bodies -- although it is reported that, even after the payment of the fine
    by the families, state officials only allowed the delivery of two bodies
    per week (Human Rights Watch, May 10, 2005). The Family s Remarks No
    information regarding remarks or reactions by Mr. Heidari s family is
    available. Historical Background Iranian Arabs, some 2 to 3 million
    individuals, comprising approximately*** 3% of the country s population,
    reside in Khuzestan, Bushehr, Hormozgan, Fars, and Khorasan provinces. The
    largest number of Arabs reside in the Southern and Western regions of
    Khuzestan. Although Khuzestan is a very rich province due to oil reserves
    and fertile farmlands, most of its inhabitants suffer from poverty and
    deprivation. The Arab population in Khuzestan is often marginalized and
    deprived of the resources in the province. They attribute their
    dissatisfaction with the central government to the deprivation and
    discrimination that they suffer. The history of the protests against
    government policies in Khuzestan dates back to the 1980s and 90s, with the
    protests concerning the situation of drinking water in Abadan and
    Khorramshahr in the year 2000; the protests of the people of Ahvaz,
    provoked by offensive material about Khuzestan Arabs and published in
    Ettela at Newspaper in 1985; and protests against the handling of cultural
    products by security forces in 2002, resulting in a number of deaths and
    injuries. Local sources have referred to the following as factors
    contributing to widespread dissatisfaction among the Arab population in
    Khuzestan: large-scale settlement of non-natives on lands belonging to
    Arab natives, under the guise of sugarcane development plans, handing over
    native lands to individuals affiliated with military organizations,
    environmental problems created as a result of the sugarcane development
    project, forced migration and settlement of non-natives in
    newly-established towns, as well as ethnic and cultural discriminations
    imposed by the government on the Arab po
