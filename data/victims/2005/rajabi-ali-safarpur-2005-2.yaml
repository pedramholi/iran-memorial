    Information about the execution of Mr. Ali Safarpur Rajabi has been taken
    from the Kayhan and Iran newspapers respectively on July 14 and July 16,
    2005, the ISNA News Agency, and the report of Amnesty International on
    July 22. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest
    and detention are not known. According to Amnesty International, Mr.
    Safarpur Rajabi was arrested in February 2002 and the Iran newspaper
    mentions the date of the crime as October 5, 2001, when the defendant was
    16 years old. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial
    other than it took place at Branch 1 of the Poldokhtar Judiciary (in
    Lorestan province). Charges Mr. Ali Safarpur-rajabi was charged with
    murdering Hamid Enshadi, a police officer in Poldokhtar The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Ali Safarpur Rajabi s defense. Judgment Branch 1 of the
    Poldokhtar Judiciary condemned Mr. Ali Safarpur Rajabi to death and
    approved by the Head of the Judiciary. He was hanged at 6:35 p.m. on July
    13, 2005 in the presence of judiciary officials, the ideological
    commissar, and the chief of the police at Basij Circle in Poldokhtar (
    Kayhan ).
