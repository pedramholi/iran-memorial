    The news of the execution of Mr. Mehdi Rashidpur was published in the web
    edition of the Hamshahri newspaper on January 23, 2005 and also in the web
    editions of the Kayhan and the Iran newspapers on January 20, 2005. Arrest
    and detention According to the Hamshahri newspaper, the Chief Justice of
    Yazd had stated that “The killer was a fugitive when he was arrested by
    the officers of the Central Information Administration in 2002 and
    transferred to the judiciary officials. He was arrested in Karaj where he
    used a pseudo name and worked as a construction worker. He was arrested
    due to the efforts of the judiciary organization and the Central
    Information Administration.” The Iran and the Jomhuri Eslami newspapers
    reported the date of arrest as 15 months after the crime. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to
    the Kayhan newspaper, in 2001, Mr. Rashidpur shot and killed four men and
    three women in Esfandiar, a village of Tabas. He then set two of the
    bodies on fire. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. According to the Chief Justice of Yazd, the cause
    of these crimes was the killer’s suspicion that the victims had reported
    his father for drug trafficking. He also added that the murderer used a
    five bullet weapon belonging to his father in these killings.( Hamshahri )
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Rashidpur’s defense. Judgment
    According to Hamshahri , the Chief Justice of Yazd province stated that
    Mr. Rashidpur was sentenced to death in 2002. However, due to his ability
    to pay the blood money to the family of the victims, the execution was
    postponed. Traveling to the province, the Head of the Judiciary declared
    Mr. Rashidpur "at war with God" and advised a public execution at Tabas
    Square. Mr. Mehdi Rashidpur was hanged at dawn on January 19, 2005.
