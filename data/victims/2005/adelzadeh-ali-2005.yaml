circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Ali Adelzadeh, son of Morteza, along with two other
    individuals, was announced on the website of the Hamshahri and the Kayhan
    newspapers (July 7, 2005) as well as the Fars News Agency (July 6). Arrest
    and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known, other than he was arrested subsequent to arrest and
    confession of another individual, who gave Mr. Adelzadeh’s name to the
    police. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges According to the Kayhan newspaper report, “Ali Adelzadeh committed
    eleven robberies from banks, Interest Free Loan Funds, and credit unions
    during 2003 and 2004.” The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal
    offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of
    alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant except his own confessions. According to the
    Hamshahri newspaper, the defendant confessed to fourteen counts of armed
    robbery from banks and Interest Free Loan Funds. International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the
    case of political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised.
    The National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners
    plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their
    political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations
    have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those
    prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Adelzadeh’s defense. Judgment The court called Mr. Ali Adelzadeh as “at
    war with God” and a “corruptor on earth” ( Kayhan ) and condemned him to
    death in public and returning the stolen money. The Hamshahri newspaper
    added that the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court. Mr. Ali
    Adelzadeh was executed in public in Qasemabad district in Mashad at 10 on
    the morning of July 6, 2005.
