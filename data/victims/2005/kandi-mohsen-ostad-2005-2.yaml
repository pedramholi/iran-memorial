    The execution of Mr. Mohsen Ostad Kandi was announced in the Ettala’at
    newspaper and the websites of the Iran and Hamshahri newspapers on
    December 18, 2005. Arrest and detention The exact date of Mr. Ostad
    Kandi’s arrest is not know. According to Hamshahri , his employer’s body
    was found and identified on April 10, 2003. Shortly after, the police
    summoned Mr. Ostad Kandi. Trial There is no information regarding this
    trial, other than it took place at Branch 1157 of the Criminal Court of
    Tehran. Charges Mr. Ostad Kandi was charged with murder. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    evidence provided against Mr. Ostad Kandi was his own confession. The
    newspapers reported that he had confessed to having stolen from his
    employer’s shop, but the latter found out and demanded him to return the
    belongings, subsequently Mr. Ostad Kandi murdered him. The Iran newspaper
    quoted him saying: “While driving, I shot him five times.” International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the
    case of political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised.
    The National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners
    plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their
    political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations
    have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those
    prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available concerning
    the defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohsen Ostad Kandi to death
    and the Supreme Court confirmed this ruling. He was hanged at dawn on
    December 18, 2005 in Evin prison.
