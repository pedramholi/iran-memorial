    The execution of Mr. Qobad Siah Mansuri, born in 1973 in Khoram Abad
    (Lorestan province) was announced on the websites of the Khorasan
    newspaper (April 17, 2005), the Kayhan and the Iran newspapers (April 16,
    2005). Arrest and detention According to Kayhan , on July 20, 2004, the
    defendant was returning from the city of Najaf Abad (Esfahan province)
    with two other men when they got into a fight with the Najaf Abad police.
    During this armed conflict, a policeman was killed, and Mr. Siah Mansuri
    was arrested. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Siah Mansuri was charged with armed robbery. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    Iran newspaper reported: after close examination of the robbers
    automibiles, 93 billion rials cash was discovered along with some handguns
    and Kalashnikovs. According to the Khorasan newspaper the evidence used
    against Mr. Siahmansuri were, the confession of the defendant and the
    statements of witnesses The text of the confession, however, is not
    available. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information is available on
    Mr. Siah Mansuri s defense. Judgment According to the Khorasan newspaper
    report, the judge of the first branch of Najaf Abad court issued the death
    sentence based on the following facts: creating an atmosphere of terror
    and fear among people, disturbing people s peace, participating in armed
    robberies of banks and a gold shop, and shooting in the streets and at the
    police. The ruling was confirmed by Branch 26 of the Supreme Court. Mr.
    Siahmansuri was executed on Thursday, April 14, 2005, at 6:55 am in front
    of a large group of people in Najaf Abad.
