    The news of the execution of an unknown person was published in the Sharq
    newspaper on August 16, 2005. According to this report, he was imprisoned
    in Bandar-e Abbas prison for drug trafficking. Arrest and detention The
    defendant was re-arrested when he and three other prisoners attempted to
    escape from the prison. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The charge against the defendant is reported as
    “murdering his collaborator during an escape attempt from the Bandar-e
    Abbas prison.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt In July, 2004, the
    defendant and three other prisoners attempted to escape. They injured the
    Prison Guard and broke the prison gate lock. According to Sharq , “as they
    tried to escape, they were forced back to the Guard’s Office by other
    guards. Half an hour later they were surrounded in the room. Two of the
    prisoners surrendered while the two others did not. One of the remaining
    two asked the other to surrender. When he refused, the man asked to be
    killed. Then the armed prisoner shot and killed his collaborator.” Defense
    No information is available on his defense. Judgment No details are
    available concerning this execution. According to the Sharq newspaper, the
    defendant was condemned to death. The Supreme Court confirmed the ruling
    and he was executed in the Bandar-e Abbas prison yard on August 16, 2005
    at dawn.
