    News of the execution of Yarmohammad Samadi was published on the web site
    of the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), Provincial Section (Khorasan
    Razavi province), on December 28, 2005. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges
    According to the IRNA report, the charges against the defendant were
    announced as, murdering two children from Kheirabad village, near
    Tayyebat. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. According to the IRNA report, “the defendant murdered the two
    children and dumped their bodies in a well two years ago.” Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Yarmohammad Samadi’s defense. Judgment
    According to the IRNA report, the court condemned Mr. Yarmohammad Samadi
    to two counts of death penalty for murdering two children in Tayyebat. The
    ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court and the defendant was hanged in
    public on Wednesday December 28, 2005. The report indicated that about two
    thousand people were present including the judicial and local officials.
    The families of the victims did not pardon the murderer; therefore, the
    ruling was enforced.
