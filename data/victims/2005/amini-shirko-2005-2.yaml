    Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Shirko Amini s, an
    Iranian Kurd, was collected from the Fars News Website (November 21,
    2005), Radio Farda (November 24, 2005), and from a phone interview
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) with a person
    close to him in Mahabad (August 28, 2006) Two police officers shot Mr.
    Amini dead in the Bagh Shaigan neighborhood in Mahabad at 10:00 a.m. on
    November 20, 2005. He died as a result of two bullet wounds. He was a
    practicing Sunni from Mahabad in the Azarbaijan Province in the northwest
    of Iran. He was enrolled in the accountancy program in Payam Nur
    University in the same city as a last year student. He was not connected
    to any political parties but had been arrested several times for his
    religious activities (ABF interview, August 28, 2006). Independent sources
    and news agencies reported that the Mahabad population reacted to Mr.
    Amini's killing by strikes and Bazaar closures. (Radio Farda, November 24,
    2005) The official Fars News stressed however that there was no reaction
    in response to his death. (Fars news, November 21, 2005) Mr. Amini s
    family account regarding the circumstances of Mr. Amini s death conflicts
    with the official statements about the event. Official Reactions Mr. Amini
    s death was reported in Fars News Agency. The latter, referring to a
    statement by the Head of Police News Agency of Azarbaijan Gharbi Province,
    described Mr. Amini as a "hooligan in Mahabad who was harassing ladies
    near the girls schools." (Fars News, November 21, 2005). This police
    official said that the violent reaction of Mr. Amini to the police
    officers caused the shootings. According to him, the police officers of
    the 13th precinct of Mahabad halted Mr. Amini; however he assaulted them
    with a knife and wounded one officer severely in the abdomen.
    Subsequently, the other officer, defending himself, shot Mr. Amini dead.
    (Fars News, November 21, 2005) There is no mention of a police officer
    injured by Mr. Amini in any other report. According to a person close to
    Mr. Amini, after his death at the hospital, the body was taken to the
    governor s office and from there to Orumieh for burial. With the family s
    persistence, the body was handed back to them in the presence of law
    enforcement officers and was taken to Mahabad with an ambulance. The
    burial took place under tight police control and only very close family
    members could attend it. Police officers, on their way to the funeral,
    tore down the death announcements from walls, which consisted of leaflets
    that announced the time and place of Mr. Amini s funeral (ABF interview,
    August 28, 2006). Family Reaction According to the person interviewed by
    ABF, in contrary to the official statements, he was a religious and
    generous man whose activities disturbed local officials. He used to write
    articles about Kurdistan and give public speeches. He also used to preach
    to people by reading out verses from the Quran (ABF interview, August 28,
    2006). At the age of 2, Mr Amini had lost his mother and one of his
    sisters when a bomb shell hit their house during the rocket attack of
    Mahabad by the central government. Mr. Amini chose this house from which
    the shell was shot as a place for prayers and meditation. This place was
    close to the building of National Television in Mahabad, which draw the
    unfavorable attention of the Herasat office, an intelligence unit within
    the National TV. He was therefore arrested 3 times (ABF interview, August
    28, 2006). According to Ms. Sheyda Amini, Mr. Amini s latest arrest was
    during the protests after Shwaneh Qaderi s extrajudicial killing (Radio
    Farda, November 24, 2005). Mr. Kamal Asfarm (Shwaneh Qaderi) was a 28 year
    old construction worker from Mahabad. The news of his extrajudicial
    killing along with pictures of his tortured body caused a widespread
    unrest in Kurdish towns. The protests were repressed violently and many
    political and civil activists were arrested. Mr. Amini was arrested during
    these unrests. Although he did not have any political affiliation, he was
    charged with possession of leaflets pertaining to the Kurdistan Democratic
    Party (ABF, August 28, 2006). According to the available information, Mr.
    Amini had one serious confrontation with a prison guard and was severely
    beaten as a result. At one occasion, when Mr. Amini was praying, one of
    the prison guards imitating sexual acts with another male inmate told him:
    this is the prayers, not the thing that you do! Mr. Amini got irritated
    and attacked and injured the guard. Afterwards, the prison guards beat him
    severely. Mr. Amini s father was able to get the release of Mr. Amini by
    paying Diah (a kind of monetary compensation in cases of corporal
    injuries) after news leaked from prison alerted him to the life
    threatening situation Mr. Amini was in after he attacked the guard ( ABF
    interview, August 28, 2006). None of the available information made it
    clear whether Mr. Amini was charged with any particular crime
