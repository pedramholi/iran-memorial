circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mohsen Ghaffarzadeh, also known as Hajn, was
    announced on the websites of the Shargh and the E’temad newspaper on July
    7, 2005. Shargh calls him “a rapist” although he was charged with “act
    incompatible with chastity.” E’temad refers to him as a “young man,” but
    the pictures of this news story shows an elderly man. Arrest and detention
    The details of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known; he was
    arrested in the village of Meqanjugh near Salmas (West Azarbaijan
    province). Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    Charges Mr. Ghaffarzadeh was charged with “act incompatible with
    chastity.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Ghaffarzadeh’s defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Mohsen
    Ghaffarzadeh to death and the Supreme Court approved the sentence. He was
    hanged in public at Kargar square of Salmas on July 5, 2005.
