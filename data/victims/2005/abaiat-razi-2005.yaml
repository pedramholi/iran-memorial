    At the age of 18, this protest may have been his first; it was his last.
    Information regarding the killing of Mr. Razi Abayat is drawn from an
    Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation (ABF) interview with an eyewitness, a
    list of protestors killed during demonstrations and published on the Ahvaz
    News Agency website, and another list issued by the European Ahwazi Human
    Rights Organization. Additional information about the protests has been
    gathered from interviews conducted by the Boroumand Foundation with
    several eyewitnesses, and from a report by Milan Kothari, the UN Special
    Rapporteur, on the Right to Adequate Housing, as well as reports by
    Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Ahvaz Human Rights
    Organization, the Ahvaz News Agency, the Iranian Students News Agency
    (ISNA), the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), and news websites,
    including the BBC and Gooya News.* Mr. Abayat was eighteen years old and
    single. Based on existing information, he was not affiliated with any
    political group or party. Mr. Abayat was shot and killed by plainclothes
    security forces during the Hamidieh protests in Hamidieh Sofla (Lower
    Hamidieh) on April 15, 2005. According to an ABF interview with one of the
    eyewitnesses of the Hamidieh incident, Mr. Abayat was shot and fell to the
    ground around 9:00 p.m. on Friday evening, near where the Hamidieh Police
    Station had just been seized by protestors. Two more who were trying to
    help him were also injured by the security forces shots. Based on existing
    information, Mr. Abayat was the first to be shot and killed by security
    forces during the Hamidieh protests. A Brief Description of Protests in
    Khuzestan On Friday, April 15, 2005, protests ensued, initially, in the
    Shelangabad neighborhood of Ahvaz and continued widely for several days to
    other parts of Ahvaz, Mahshahr, and Hamidiyeh, in response to the
    publication of a July 24, 1998, letter, attributed to Mohammad Ali Abtahi,
    the head of the President s Office at the time, calling for a demographic
    restructuring of the Arab population in Khuzestan, encouraging the
    immigration of non-Arab people to the region, and reducing the Arab
    population of Khuzestan to one-third of the total population of the
    province. Even though, on Saturday, April 16th, the spokesperson for the
    Iranian government officially denied the authenticity of the letter, the
    protests that had ensued, following the invitation of the Committee for
    Organizing Popular Protests in Ahvaz, ** (a committee consisting of some
    political groups, cultural institutions, civil institutions, and some
    Khuzestan Arab political and civil activists) continued widely. In the
    call for protests, the following factors were mentioned: policies by the
    central government to confiscate the lands belonging to Arab farmers,
    through various projects such as the Sugarcane Project; increasing
    marginalization as well as profound dissatisfaction among Khuzestan Arabs
    due to government efforts to eradicate the Arab identity; and uprooting
    the Arabs of Khuzestan. Security forces first attacked the demonstrators
    with tear gas and subsequently opened fire on demonstrators. Government
    sources announced the number of individuals killed to be three or four,
    quoting the Islamic Republic s Minister of Defense (ISNA, 19.04.2005). The
    number of victims was 50-60 according to local activists, 29 based on
    Amnesty International statements, and 50 according to Human Rights Watch.
    The Ahvaz Human Rights Organization also published the names of 51
    individuals killed during the protests. Hundreds more were injured. The
    Public and Revolutionary Prosecution Office of Ahvaz declared the number
    of detainees for whom files had been created to be 447 (IRNA, 25.04.2005),
    but local sources announced the number of detainees to be more than 1200.
    Some intellectuals and ethnic leaders were also among the detainees.
    According to reports by local activists and human rights institutions,
    such as Amnesty International, the families received news of the deaths of
    some of the detainees from security forces. Based on the Human Rights
    Watch report, in some cases the authorities had asked the families of the
    victims for 50 million riyals (later reduced to 15 million riyals) as
    compensation for harms sustained by government buildings during the
    protests before returning the bodies of the victims -- although it is
    reported that, even after the payment of the fine by the families, state
    officials only allowed the delivery of two bodies per week. (Human Rights
    Watch, May 10, 2005) The Officials Reaction One of the eyewitnesses told
    ABF that Mr. Abayat s father and brother were called and told by the Ahvaz
    Office of the Ministry of Information that they would not be permitted to
    hold funeral services for their son. Iranian state and judiciary
    authorities did not provide clear information regarding the number or
    names of the individuals killed during the Khuzestan protests. Some of the
    state officials acknowledged in a general statement tha
