    Extreme poverty, discrimination, and unadressed grievances drew him to the
    protest in the oil-rich Khuzestan Province in a spring day in 2005.
    Information about Mr. Ali Batrani has been collected from several sources,
    including Amnesty International's appeal case, Amnesty International's
    interview with Mr. Batrani's family (May 17, 2006), and a list - issued by
    the European Ahwazi Human Rights Organization - of protestors who were
    killed during protests in Ahvaz. Additional information about these
    protests has been gathered from interviews, with several eyewitnesses,
    conducted by the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation, and from a report by
    Milan Kothari, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing,
    as well as reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the
    Ahvaz Human Rights Organization, the Ahvaz News Agency, the Iranian
    Students News Agency (ISNA), the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), and
    news websites, including the BBC and Gooya News.* Mr. Batrani was a young
    Arab man from Ahvaz, who was arrested there during the protests of April
    15, 2005. Three days later, on April 18, his body was found in the Karun
    River. His family told Amnesty International that Mr. Batrani s body was
    not handed over to them until May 10. The Officials Reaction Amnesty
    International wrote to Iranian authorities in November 2005, calling for
    Mr. Batrani s death to be investigated without delay and justice delivered
    to the perpetrators. Islamic Republic authorities never responded to the
    request. Iranian state and judiciary authorities did not provide clear
    information regarding the number or names of the individuals killed during
    the Khuzestan protests. Some of the state officials acknowledged in a
    general statement that some citizens had been killed but did not provide
    further information. Ali Shamkhani, the Minister of Defense at the time,
    who was present in Khuzestan as the representative of the state, announced
    the number of individuals killed to be three or four (ISNA, April 19,
    2005). On April 20, 2005, 180 members of the seventh parliament wrote a
    letter to Seyyed Mohammad Khatami, Iran s president at the time, to demand
    restitution for the harms brought upon the people of Ahvaz and the release
    of innocent detainees who, according to the parliamentarians, were mostly
    teenage students and young people. In an April 25, 2005 letter to Mohammad
    Khatami, Iran s president at the time, Jasem Shadidzadeh, Secretary
    General of the Wefaq Party and Representative of Ahvaz in the sixth
    parliament, demanded that the bodies of the victims be delivered to their
    families as soon as possible for proper funeral and customary mourning
    ceremonies. According to reports by local activists and human rights
    organizations, such as Amnesty International, security officials gave the
    news of the death of some of the protest detainees to the families. Some
    of the eyewitnesses of the protests explicitly remarked, in their
    interviews with the Boroumand Foundation, that the security forces
    actively prevented the delivery of the victims bodies to their families,
    for quite some time, and had, in some cases, summoned and threatened the
    families. According to a Human Rights Watch report, in some cases the
    officials had demanded that the families pay a 50 million riyal fine
    (later reduced to 15 million riyals) for damage sustained by government
    buildings during the protests, before they could receive the victims
    bodies -- although it is reported that, even after the payment of the fine
    by the families, state officials only allowed the delivery of two bodies
    per week (Human Rights Watch, May 10, 2005). The Family s Remarks His
    family told Amnesty International that signs of severe torture were quite
    visible on Mr. Batrani s body. The family observed several signs, such as
    a hole in the knee, bruises on his face and around the eyes, marks of
    handcuffs on his wrists, and the soles of his feet, which were black and
    white. According to the report from Amnesty International, authorities did
    not hand over his body to the family until May 10, 2005. The family,
    eventually, had to pay a fee to be given permission for his burial. A
    Brief Description of Arab Protests in Khuzestan On Friday, April 15, 2005,
    protests ensued, initially, in the Shelangabad neighborhood of Ahvaz and
    continued widely for several days to other parts of Ahvaz, Mahshahr, and
    Hamidiyeh, in response to the publication of a July 24, 1998, letter,
    attributed to Mohammad Ali Abtahi, the head of the President s Office at
    the time, calling for a demographic restructuring of the Arab population
    in Khuzestan, encouraging the immigration of non-Arab people to the
    region, and reducing the Arab population of Khuzestan to one-third of the
    total population of the province. Even though, on Saturday, April 16th,
    the spokesperson for the Iranian government officially denied the
    authenticity of the letter, the protests that had ensued, following the
    invitation of the Committee for Organ
