    The information about Mr. Rostam Tajik, a citizen of Afghanistan, has been
    gathered from the following sources: the website of the Kayhan newspaper
    (Dec. 6, 2005), the Aftab website referring to the Hamshahri newspaper
    (Dec. 7, 2005), correspondence of United Nations Special Rapporteur on
    extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Philip Alston, dated
    December 8, 2005 (published on Mar. 12, 2007; A/HRC/4/20/Add.1), the
    websites of the Javan and the Hamshahri newspapers (Dec. 11, 2005) and the
    website of Amnesty International (Dec. 12, 2005). In his report, the
    United Nations Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran has failed to cooperate with the mandate and
    reiterate[s his] requests for a comprehensive and detailed indication of
    the details of individuals who have been sentenced to death for crimes
    committed when they were less than eighteen years of age. He also regrets
    that he has not received any response for his correspondence about the
    cases of at least 30 under-aged individuals condemned to death. He notes
    that the execution of Rostom Tajik and any further executions of juvenile
    offenders are incompatible with the international legal obligations of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran... The right to life of persons below eighteen
    years of age and the obligation of States to guarantee the enjoyment of
    this right to the maximum extent possible are both specifically expressed
    in Article 6 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Besides,
    Article 37(a) expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be
    imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age. In
    addition, Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and
    Political Rights provides that the death penalty shall not be imposed for
    crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age. Mr. Alston points
    to a note verbale from the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of
    Iran on 8 March 2005 to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human
    Rights in which it was stated: In recent years the enactment of the death
    penalty for individuals aged under 18 has been halted and there has been
    no instance of such punishments for the category of youth. The legal ban
    on under-aged capital punishment has been incorporated into the draft Bill
    on Juvenile Courts, which is at present before parliament for
    ratification. Arrest and Detention According to the available information,
    Mr. Tajik became a fugitive subsequent to the alleged murder in Esfahan.
    The police arrested him in Qazvin on May 19, 2001. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial, other than he was tried at Branch 9 of
    the General Court of Esfahan. Charges The charge against Mr. Rostam Tajik
    is reported differently by the media. Javan reports that he murdered
    another Afghan citizen in the Baqushkhaneh district of Esfahan in 2001,
    but according to the Hamshahri and Kayhan newspapers, he murdered a young
    woman named Nafiseh Rafi i during an attempted robbery of her house on May
    13, 2001. She was the wife of Mr. Tajik s employer. Mr. Tajik was 16 years
    old at the time of the alleged crime (Amnesty International). The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt According to the Kayhan newspapers, the eleven
    year old daughter of the victim was also injured during the robbery in
    which her mother was killed. The girl was hospitalized and she later
    recovered. She was able to identify her mother s murderer. There is no
    more information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    Defense No information is available on Mr. Tajik s defense. Judgment
    Branch 9 of the General Court of Esfahan condemned Mr. Rostam Tajik to
    death. Branch 9 of the Supreme Court approved the death sentence. Mr.
    Rostam Tajik was hanged in public on December 10, 2005 at the Baqushkhaneh
    Park in Esfahan. The Hamshahri reports: people shouted God is great and
    enthusiastically demanded the execution. A young physician visited Rostam
    and declared that he was healthy and ready for the execution. Then, two
    officials took him to the place of his execution and people expressed
    their approval by shouting Thank you! Thank you!
