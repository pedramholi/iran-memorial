    The execution of Mr. Yunes, along with two other individuals, was
    announced on the web sites of the Iran and the Sharq newspapers on
    November 21, 2005. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. According to the Iran
    newspaper, “after the crime [kidnapping and rape of a 19-year old man] was
    committed, a police team was formed to arrest these individuals. After the
    arrest, the defendants were sent to the court.” The report did not specify
    the dates when the crime and arrest took place. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. The newspaper report did not specify
    the dates of arrest and execution. It is not clear whether there was an
    appeal court. Charges According to the Iran newspaper, “police reported
    that three men named Yunes, Hossein, and Ruhollah, posed as taxi drivers,
    kidnapped and raped a nineteen year old man.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on his defense. Judgment The Iran newspaper states that in
    accordance with the judicial ruling, Mr. Yunes was executed at Dizelabad
    prison in Kermanshah at dawn on November 18, 2005.
