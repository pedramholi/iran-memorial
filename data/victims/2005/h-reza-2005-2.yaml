    According to the report from the office of information and public
    relations of Khuzestan province, the charges brought against Mr. Reza H.
    were described as follows: “He committed a premeditated murder. He took
    his victim, Hossain A., to Baghferdos and killed him with a knife.” The

    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian

    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt According to Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, this was
    an honor killing. Defense No information is available on Mr. Reza H’s
    defense. Judgment A court condemned Mr. Reza H. to death and Branch 26 of
    the Supreme Court approved the sentence. He was executed in public on May
    4, 2005 in Shahid Bandar square in Ahvaz.
