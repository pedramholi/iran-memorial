    News of the execution of Majid Alghosi was published on the web site of
    the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on May 10, 2005. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. According to
    the newspaper report, Branch Five of Chalus Court issued the ruling and it
    was confirmed by Branch 33 of the Supreme Court. Charges The Public
    Prosecutor of Chalus stated: the defendant, “resident of Ojabit village in
    Kelardasht, murdered one of his relatives, named Siavash Abbasian, because
    of an ethnic disputes with him in the vicinity of the Chalus Forensic
    Office in 2001.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Alghosi’s defense.
    Judgment The details of the execution verdict are not known. According to
    the newspaper report, Mr. Majid Alghosi was condemned to death for murder.
    After the ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court, he was executed in
    the presence of judicial and security officials and the victim’s family in
    the courtyard of Noshahr Prison II (Mazandaran province).
