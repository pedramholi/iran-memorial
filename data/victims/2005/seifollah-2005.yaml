    as “carrying 4 kilograms heroin”. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Seifollah's defense. Judgment No information is available on the detail of
    this execution. According to JameJam , the ruling was issued by Branch one
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Borujerd. Then, the Supreme Court
    confirmed the ruling. The defendant was hanged in Qiam square of Borujerd
    (Lorestan province). There is no date of execution in the report.
