    The execution of Mr. Abdollah Z., known as Hatam Gorgi, along with 3 other
    individuals, was announced in the Hamshahri newspaper (April 12 and May 5,
    2005) and the Iran newspaper (May 5, 2005). Arrest and detention According
    to Hamshahri , eleven members of a crime-ring were arrested subsequent to
    a murder, which took place in November 2002. Trial Mr. Abdollah Z. was
    tried at the Tehran Criminal Court, Branch 1157. No other information is
    available. Charges According to Iran , Mr. Abdollah Z. was charged with:
    managing a crime-ring of armed individuals and murder of a young man who
    went for a walk to the Lavizan Forest along with his wife. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt Mr.
    Abdollah Z reportedly confessed to the murder. There were inconsistencies
    regarding his confessions. Hamshahri reported: “At the first court
    session… Hatam Gorgi told the judge… that he had committed the murder…”
    However, the same article added that the defendant’s nephew, another
    member of this crime-ring, also confessed to the murder. Regarding to the
    witnesses who identified the defendant, Hamshahri reported: “Only 3 days
    after the shooting, Rosa, the victim’s wife, came to the police station
    and identified the killer of her husband. Moreover, one of the officers of
    Police Station Number 164, was able to identify one of the gang members,
    who had been surrounded and wounded by the police.” International human
    rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the
    case of political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised.
    The National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners
    plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their
    political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations
    have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those
    prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available on the
    defense. Judgment The court condemned Mr. Abdollah Z. to death; and the
    Supreme Court approved the sentence. He was hanged at Evin prison on May
    3, 2005.
