# --- DEATH ---
date_of_death: 2005-08-22
age_at_death: 18
place_of_death: "Bandar Abbas"
province: "Hormozgan"
cause_of_death: "Execution » Hanging"
circumstances: >
    The news of the execution of Mr. Hassan J. and three other individuals was
    published in the web edition of the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August 20,
    2005 and the Jamejam newspaper on August 22. Jamejam mentioned the age of
    the defendant to be 18 but his age at the time of the alleged crime is not
    known. International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment
    against those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the
    crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
    Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid
    capital punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. There is no date of arrest in the reports. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to
    the reports, the defendant was charged with kidnapping and raping a 10
    year old girl . The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hassan
    J. s defense. Judgment According to Jomhuri Eslami , the Bandar Abbas
    Revolutionary Public Prosecution court condemned Mr. Hassan J. to death.
    The verdict was approved by the Supreme Court. He was hanged in public on
    August 22, 2005.
