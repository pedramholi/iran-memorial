    The news of the execution of Mr. Hamed K. and three other individuals was
    published in the web editions of the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August
    20, 2005 and the Jamejam newspaper on August 22. According to Jamejam ,
    the defendant was 18 at the time of execution but his age at the time of
    the alleged crime is now known. International laws have strictly
    prohibited capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18
    at the time of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil
    and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran
    has the obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed
    before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. There is no date of arrest
    in the reports. Trial No information is available on the defendant s
    trial. According to the reports, Bandar Abbas Revolutionary Public
    Prosecution Court issued the judgment and the Supreme Tribunal approved
    it. Charges According to the reports, the defendant was charged with
    kidnapping and raping a 10 years old girl. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. The reports state that the
    defendant had a criminal record of raping 7 and 8 year old girls. Defense
    No information is available on the defense. Judgment According to Jomhuri
    Eslami , the Bandar Abbas Court condemned Mr. Hamed K. to death. The
    sentence was approved by the Supreme Court. He was hanged in public in
    Bandar Abbas on August 22, 2005.
