    The news of the execution of Mr. Aziz Khalkani from Beyehran village near

    with two other persons named Abbas and Mas ud in 1996. He was detained in
    Orumieh. He spent nine years and four months in prison. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to
    the report, the charge against Mr. Khalkani was killing a secret service
    agent . The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Khalkani s defense. Judgment No
    information is available on the details of this execution. According to
    the Roshangary web site, Mr. Khalkani was executed on December 18, 2005.
