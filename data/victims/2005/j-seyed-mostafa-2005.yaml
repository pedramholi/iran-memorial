    23-year-old Seyed Mostafa J. had just finished his military service. One
    afternoon in the month of Ramadan, he got into his red Landrover and went
    out to spend time with friends News of Mr. Seyed Mostafa J. s passing was
    published in Ettela at (October 18, 2005), Iran (October 17, 2005), and
    Hamshahri (October 17, 2005) newspapers. Additional information about this
    case was obtained from various media, including Hamshahri (October 18,
    2005), Etemad (January 29, 2008), ISNA News Agency (October 6, 2007), and
    other sources.* At the time of the event, the story attracted the
    attention of various domestic and foreign media stationed in Iran. This
    case is related to Mr. Seyed Mostafa J. s death. According to the
    authorities, he was involved in a car chase with police acting on the
    basis of a phone call received by police dispatch by which an individual
    had reported that a person or persons were breaking the Ramadan fast in
    public and turning up the volume of music in a car. Mr. Seyed Mostafa J.
    was 23 years old and resided in Tehran s District 14. He had finished his
    military service in the Revolutionary Guards two months prior to the
    incident. According to his brother, Mr. Seyed Mostafa J. was supposed to
    take his mother (who suffered from cardiac disease) to the doctor on
    October 15, 2005, but she had asked him not to accompany her to the
    hospital because he was fasting. According to a person close to Mr. Seyed
    Mostafa J., he left the house in the afternoon of that same day to spend
    time with his friends. A few minutes later, however, while he was still
    alone in the car, he was chased by police officers. Based on available
    evidence, he was driving a red Land Rover (or Range Rover) near his place
    of residence in the vicinity of Tehran s Nabard Street. Mr. Seyed Mostafa
    J. s case is related to a hasty police shooting which resulted in his
    death. The Account of the Event In an effort to apprehend Mr. Seyed
    Mostafa J., an officer of the Nabard Street 132nd Police Precinct in
    Tehran s District 14 shot him six times at close range, severely wounding
    him. Based on the entirety of the information from various media quoting
    from the perpetrator, eyewitnesses, judiciary and police officials, and
    the next of kin s lawyers, the story unfolded as follows: Subsequent to a
    phone call to Police 110 at 4:27 PM on the afternoon of October 15, 2005,
    Nabard Street 132nd Police Precinct patrol officers were told of a
    suspicious vehicle in the vicinity of Hosseini 35-meter Street. Based on
    published reports quoting the Tehran Chief of Police, the caller reported
    breaking the Ramadan fast in public in a car with the volume of music
    turned very high . Based on this report, the police officer became
    suspicious of Mr. Seyed Mostafa J. s car and ordered it to stop, but he
    disregarded the police order and continued on his path, entering Aref
    Street. According to the perpetrator s statements, he fired a shot in the
    air and ordered Mr. Seyed Mostafa to halt, stopped his car once again, and
    asked him for his identity card. Mr. Seyed Mostafa J. stated that the
    officer was not the traffic police and disobeyed the police order. This
    resulted in insults and an altercation between the police officer and the
    suspect. Mr. Seyed Mostafa J. tried to wrest the weapon that was pointed
    at him away from the officer. The duty soldier accompanying the police
    officer intervened and hit the victim on the hand with a club, enabling
    the officer to recover the weapon and spray him with pepper spray. Mr.
    Seyed Mostafa J. was able to run away once again, however. The Nabard
    Street 132nd Police Precinct officer chased Mr. Seyed Mostafa J., even
    though the latter was no longer in the Precinct s jurisdiction, and shot
    at his tires after ordering him to stop. Mr. Seyed Mostafa J. continued to
    drive, nevertheless, until he was forced to stop in front of Shahid
    Bahonar Girls School due to heavy traffic caused by the end of the school
    day. This time, the police officer shot Mr. Seyed Mostafa J. several times
    at close range from the passenger window, in front of eyewitnesses,
    injuring him. Saying Why are you shooting, I haven t done anything , Mr.
    Seyed Mostafa J. dragged himself out of the car, whereupon the officer
    sprayed him with pepper spray again. Mr. Seyed Mostafa J. fell to the
    ground. He was left on the ground in that condition for 20 minutes as the
    police officer searched his car. Thereafter, the soldier put Mr. Seyed
    Mostafa J. in the police car with the help of two of the neighborhood
    residents and took him to Mardom Maternity Hospital, which lacked the
    proper facilities to care for him. Based on available information, after
    three hours, the police took Mr. Seyed Mostafa J. to the Police Force s
    Vali-e Asr Hospital; the doctors were not able to save Mr. Seyed Mostafa
    J. s life and he died at that hospital due to the severity of his injuries
    and severe bleeding. Different accounts of this event have been given by
    various people, including the Prosecutor s Rep
