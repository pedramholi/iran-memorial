    The execution of Mr. Farhad Akbari Diba (Akbari Diba), son of Mohammad,
    along with Abdorreza Akbari Diba , was announced on the websites of the
    Central Prosecutor s Office and the Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) of
    Markazi province (Dec. 7, 2005). Both defendants were residents of the
    Asadabad village near Hamedan. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of
    Mr. Akbari Diba s arrest and detention are not known. Trial Branch two of
    the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Arak (Markazi province) tried Mr.
    Akbari Diba. Charges Mr. Farhad Akbari Diba was charged with armed robbery
    and murder . According to Arak Prosecutor, Messers Akabrinia were blocking
    the roads from Arak to Khomein, Zanjan, Takestan, Mianeh, Nobaran in
    Saveh, and Shustar for extortion, frightening people, and murder .
    (Central Prosecutor s Office and ISNA - Dec. 7, 2005) The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Farhad Akbari Diba. The report refers to the
    confessions of Abdorreza Akbari Diba who was executed along with the
    defendant. According to Iran newspaper , Mr. Abdorreza Akbari Diba had
    confessed to extortion and armed robbery in the vicinity of Saveh (Markazi
    province) and disclosed the details of a horrible crime at Khomein
    intersection. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Akbari Diba s defense. Judgment The
    Public Prosecutor of Arak called Mr. Farhad Akbari Diba at war with God
    and a corruptor on earth. He was hanged in the presence of the victims
    families and other observers at the place of the crime in Arak on December
    7, 2005.
