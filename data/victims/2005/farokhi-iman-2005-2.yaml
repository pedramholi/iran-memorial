    News of the execution of Mr. Iman Farokhi, along with two others, was
    published in the Iran newspaper on January 20, 2005. Additional
    information was taken from the Hamshahri newspaper on January 20, 2005,
    the Iran newspaper on December 26, 2004, and the Entekhab newspaper on
    November 23, 2000. Additionally, Amnesty International referred to this
    execution in a report, Iran: The last executioner of children, published
    on January 1, 2011. Mr. Farokhi s case was related to the murder of a
    25-year-old noncommissioned officer on the Plangchal path in Darakeh,
    Tehran, on November 17, 2000. He was from Jiroft and was only 16 years old
    at the time of the incident. International laws have strictly prohibited
    capital punishment against those who were under the age of 18 at the time
    of committing the crime. As a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political
    Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the
    obligation to avoid capital punishment for an offence committed before the
    age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr. Farokhi was arrested, along with
    another person, on November 21, 2000. On the day of the incident,
    emergency personnel at the Shohada Hospital informed the Evin police
    station that two young men, injured by blows of a knife, had been
    transferred to the hospital and one of them died due to his injuries.
    After officers interrogated the other injured person, they were able to
    identify and arrest the perpetrators in a coffee shop at Laleh Park, which
    they frequented, only 72 hours later. Mr. Farokhi did not accept the
    charge and because he was not legally an adult, a temporary arrest warrant
    was issued and he was transferred to the Correction and Rehabilitation
    Center for further investigation (Entekhab newspaper). He escaped the
    center in February of 2001 (Amnesty International). However, after two
    years, he was identified among the prisoners in Jiroft Prison and
    transferred back to Tehran. He had been arrested for carrying an illegal
    weapon and robbery in Jiroft after his escape from Tehran. He was
    condemned to 3 years imprisonment for these charges. Trial The Children
    Court in Tehran tried Mr. Farokhi (Iran newspaper on December 26, 2004).
    However, no information is available on his trial. Charges The charge
    brought against Mr. Farokhi was announced as murder. According to the
    media reports, on the day of the incident, the victim and his cousin went
    mountain climbing around Darakeh where they witnessed three young men
    harassing a girl. They intervened but faced an attack by young men who
    injured them with blows of a knife. The victim died in the hospital. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The evidence presented against Mr.
    Farokhi was the testimony of the victim s cousin and of other witnesses,
    the forensics report, his own confession, and a complaint by the victim s
    parents. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. Defense Mr. Farokhi was younger than 18
    when the incident occurred. After his first arrest, he did not accept the
    charge and objected to the ruling. His case was referred to Branch Four of
    the Supreme Court but his objection was rejected there. No information is
    available on his defense. Judgment The Children s Court in Tehran
    condemned Mr. Iman Farokhi to death and five years imprisonment for murder
    and to receive 80 lashes for drinking alcoholic beverages. Branch Four of
    the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. He was hanged, along with two
    others, at the Evin Prison yard in Tehran on January 19, 2005.
