    The information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Kamal Asfarm
    (also known as Shwaneh Qaderi also reported as Seyyed Qader) was drawn
    from an interview of a person close to Mr. Asfarm with Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation (ABF, August 11, 2006),the report by the Special
    Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary and Arbitrary Executions (March 26,
    2006, E/CN.4/2006/53), the statement by Human Rights Watch (August 10,
    2005 and February 16, 2006), the report of Kurdistan Human Rights
    Organization (July 13, 2005), the Iranian Student s News Agency (ISNA)
    reports (July 31, 2005), Sharif News (August 22, 2011), the BBC Persian
    (July 28, 2005), Deutsche Welle (July 22, 2005) and Police News Agency
    reports (July 28, 2005). This news was also reported by many foreign media
    outlets such as the New York Times (August 14, 2005) and Aljazeera (August
    8, 2005). Mr. Asfarm was a 24-year-old Kurdish man, a construction worker
    and a political activist who was killed by the police. He was on the
    police s Wanted Person s list for a while. After two days, some pictures
    of his tortured body were published on the internet. These pictures, aside
    from the scars obviously created by the forensic team s autopsy
    examination, showed severe bruises and inflammations on his face, genital
    area and back. Following the publication of these pictures, people from
    the town of Mahabad protested in the streets. These protests spread to
    other cities in the Kurdistan Province, such as Baneh, Saqqez and
    Sardasht, and led to the arrest of many demonstrators and civil society
    activists (Human Rights Watch, August 10, 2005). At least 19 people were
    killed during these events. The names and numbers of these victims were
    listed in the report of the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Killings,
    Summary and Arbitrary Executions on March 26, 2006 (Special Rapporteur,
    March 26, 2006). Death At 7:30 p.m. on July 9, 2005 he was shot by teh
    police in the side and leg. The police took him away from the crime scene
    alive. Witnesses reported that police dragged Mr. Asfarm s body on the
    ground for 50 meters before putting him in a car. The exact date of his
    death is not clear. According to the family the body was returned to them
    after autopsy on July 12 (ABF interview, August 11, 2005). Authorities
    claimed that they returned the body on the July 10 (Police News Agency,
    July 28, 2005). According to Mr. Saleh Nikbakht, the Asfarm s lawyer, the
    judiciary experts came to the conclusion that two bullets shot from a
    klashnikov rifle killed Mr. Asfarm. While the first bullet hit him in the
    leg and disabled him, the second bullet was shot from a very close
    distance and hit him in the chest (Etemad Melli, September 25, 2006).
    State Officials Reactions According to the Police News Agency, Colonel
    Behmanesh, Deputy of Guidance and Social Affairs to the Western Azarbaijan
    Police Chief, reported that in the afternoon of July 9, 2005, police
    received a report about Mr. Asfarm s whereabouts in Poshtap, a
    neighborhood in Mahabad. The police officers saw Mr. Asfarm drinking
    alcohol with his friends. According to Colonel Behmanesh, Mr. Asfarm
    attacked the officers with a knife and one of the officers shot him in
    defense. Afterwards, the officers took him to a hospital in an ambulance
    immediately but he bled to death. Then, the body was taken to the forensic
    office and was returned to the family after an autopsy on July 10, 2005
    (Police News Agency, July 28, 2005). The Police News Agency, after Mr.
    Asfarm s death on July 28, 2005, reported that Mr. Asfarm was wanted for
    murder, extortion, sedition, rape and blackmail . Additionally, Mr. Akbar
    Feiz, the President of the Judiciary of Western Azarbaijan Province
    convicted him of seeking asylum in grouplets and hindering the election
    (BBC Persian, August 17, 2005). In addition, the Governor of Western
    Azarbaijan Province said to ISNA that Mr. Asfarm evaded military service
    and because of this, he was prosecuted by the Judicial Organization of the
    Armed Forces (Sharif News, August 22, 2011). This veracity of latter
    conviction was confirmed by a person close to Mr. Asfarm. This person said
    that Mr. Asfarm refused to serve his military service because he believed
    that the conscripts were cruel to the people (ABF interview, August 11,
    2006). Colonel Behmanesh also reiterated that the bruises, which were
    visible in the pictures circulating on the internet, were caused by the
    autopsy examination and appearance of the body had changed due to
    decomposition that occurs in the human body days after death. The Colonel
    also stated that the people who published those pictures were enemies. On
    August 15, Firuz Mohammadi, the Chief of Azarbaijan Forensic Office denied
    the probability that Mr. Asfarm was tortured and claimed that the bruises
    on the body were self inflicted (BBC Persian, July 28, 2005). Sharif News,
    a news agency with ties to the government, stated that the bruises on the
    body were the signs of livor mortis (Sharif News, August 22
