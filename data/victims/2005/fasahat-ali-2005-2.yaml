    News of the execution of Ali Fesahat was published on the web site of the
    Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on September 15, 2005. Arrest and Detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. According to
    the report, Yazd Court issued the ruling, the Recognition Council
    investigated it, and the Supreme Court confirmed it. Charges According to
    the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper report, the defendant killed a young man,
    named Ahmad Kheirandish, in a fight on February 24, 2005. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their
    political opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities
    sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Fesahat’s defense. Judgment According to the Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper, Mr. Ali Fesahat was hanged in the presence of the
    victim’s family and some bystanders in the Yazd Central Prison on
    September 14, 2005.
