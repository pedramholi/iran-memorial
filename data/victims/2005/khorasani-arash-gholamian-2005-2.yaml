    The execution of Mr. Arash Gholamian Khorasani, son of Gholam Reza, along
    with two other individuals, was announced on the website of the Hamshahri
    and the Kayhan newspapers (July 7, 2005) as well as the Fars News Agency
    (July 6). Arrest and Detention According to the Hamshahri newspaper, Mr.
    Arash Gholamian Khorasani was arrested at his residence. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. According to the
    Hamshahri newspaper, this trial took place in Branch Two of the Public
    Court in Mashhad. Charges According to the Kayhan newspaper report, the
    charges against Mr. Arash Gholamian Khorasani were announced as
    “participation in armed robberies.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and
    other criminal offences. Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant except his own confessions. According to
    the Hamshahri newspaper, he confessed to a bank robbery, in collaboration
    with two other individuals. “He also confessed to a murder in 1998 for
    which he was able to get the consent of the victim’s family. But since he
    had to pay for blood money, he decided to commit armed robbery. The
    newspaper quoted him saying, ‘After awhile, along with four others, we
    established a gang. We got some motorcycles, a Kalashnikov, a sidearm, and
    a vehicle, and robbed an Interest Free Loan Fund.’ The newspaper reported
    that he confessed that during the robbery from Mellat Bank, he had a
    sidearm and his collaborator, Davud, had a Kalashnikov.” Whether or not
    these weapons were found at the time of, or subsequent to, the arrest is
    not known. International human rights organizations have repeatedly
    condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its
    systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Gholamian Khorasani’s defense. Judgment
    According to the Hamshahri newspaper report, Branch Two of the public
    court recognized Mr. Arash Gholamian Khorasani as “at war with God” and a
    “corruptor on earth,” and condemned him to death and returning the stolen
    money. He was executed in public in Qasemabad district in Mashhad at 10
    a.m. on July 6, 2005.
