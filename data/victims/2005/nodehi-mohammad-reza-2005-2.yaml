    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Nodehi along with two other persons was
    published on the web edition of the Khorasan newspaper on December 21,
    2005. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Mohammad Reza Nodehi was
    announced as "rape." The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Nodehi’s defense. Judgment Branch 101 of the Sabzevar Criminal Court
    (Khorasan province) condemned the defendant to death and a branch of the
    Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. According to the Khorasan newspaper
    report, before the execution, the Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor of
    Sabzevar talked about the Islamic punishments. Mr. Mohammad Reza Nodehi
    was executed in public in the sports stadium of Sabzevar at 6:30 am on
    Tuesday December 20, 2005 at the presence of some officials.
