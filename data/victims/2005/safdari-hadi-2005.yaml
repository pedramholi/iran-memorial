    The execution of Mr. Hadi Safdari, son of Nasrollah, and known as Jabbar
    Sing, was published in the web site of the Group 8 Reporters in Khorasan
    Shomali (April 28, 2005), as well as the web edition of the Kayhan
    newspaper on May 2, 2005. According to the report of Group 8, the public
    Revolutionary prosecutor of Bojnord stated that in 2005 the courts ruling
    would be implemented strictly and that “in the public prosecution office
    of Bojnord, a committee has been established in order to investigate the
    obstacles to the implementation of courts rulings, which will be effective
    in their speedy implementation… This Committee also helps archive the
    criminal records of the convicts and create a data bank on the status and
    background of these hooligans, through which law enforcement officers can
    identify and control [the activities of] these individuals.” He claimed
    that traditional teahouses are centers where youth get contaminated and
    added: “last year such cafes were under surveillance and approximately 50
    vagabonds have been arrested… Reportedly, there are still [suspicious]
    gatherings and law enforcement officers have been authorized to inspect
    various location in plain clothes in order to identify the cause of
    corruption and crime and confront them.” He warned the owners of
    traditional cafes to “observe Islamic values, otherwise violators would be
    prosecuted and their businesses closed.” Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on his trial. Charges Kayhan stated that
    Mr. Safdari was charged with “an immoral, despicable act”. The Group 8
    reported quoted the Public Prosecutor saying that in 2004, Mr. Safdari
    “committed the despicable act of sodomy, and with a help of a friend
    recorded this unchaste act with a video camera and they both blackmailed
    the passive partner.” This man filed a complaint with the Judiciary and
    Mr. Safdari and his co-defendant were arrested. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    Group 8 report stated: “at the time of arrest, video taped were recovered
    from the crime scene and the ruling was released taking into account Hadi
    Safdari’s confession.” According to the reports, Mr. Safdari had a
    criminal record including “sedition” and “moral corruption.” International
    human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the
    Islamic Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and
    solitary confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have
    questioned the authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the
    case of political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised.
    The National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners
    plead guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their
    political beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations
    have also pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those
    prisoners who are freed. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Safdari’s defense. Judgment The details of the verdict are not known.
    According to the Group 8, the prosecutor stated: “since the aforementioned
    individual was a hooligan” and had a criminal record, “in order to teach a
    lesson to all hooligans”, he was condemned to death. The ruling was
    approved by the Supreme Court. According to the same source, Mr. Hadi
    Safdari was hanged in the presence of the prosecutor, other judicial
    authorities, police officers, as well as bystanders at six a.m. on April
    28, 2005. The Public Prosecutor of Bojnord claimed that in 2002, Mr.
    Safdari had murdered his wife, but after spending 18 months in prison,
    with the consent of the victim’s family, was released from prison.” He
    went on to say: “the other defendant, with initials M. Sh. who was an
    accomplice and witnessed this immoral act and filmed it, has been
    condemned to flogging and imprisonment and is now serving his prison
    sentence.”
