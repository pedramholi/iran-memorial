    The execution of Mr. Davud Daliran, son of Esma’il, along with two other
    individuals, was announced on the website of the Hamshahri and the Kayhan
    newspapers (July 7, 2005) as well as the Fars News Agency (July 6). Arrest
    and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention
    are not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial.
    According to the Hamshahri newspaper, this trial took place in Branch Two
    of the Public Court. Charges According to the Kayhan newspaper report, the
    charges against Mr. Davud Daliran were announced as “participation in
    armed robberies from an Interest Free Loan Fund and a bank in 2002.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. The
    Hamshahri newspaper refers to confessions of another detainee, Arash, who
    mentioned Davud as his collaborator. The newspaper adds that Davud also
    confessed to armed robberies along with Arash. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. In the case of
    political detainees, these confessions are, at times, televised. The
    National Television broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead
    guilty to vague and false charges, repent and renounce their political
    beliefs, and/or implicate others. Human rights organizations have also
    pointed to the pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are
    freed. Defense No information is available on Mr. Daliran’s defense.
    Judgment According to the Hamshahri newspaper report, Branch Two of the
    public court recognized Mr. Davud Daliran as “at war with God” and a
    “corruptor on earth” and condemned him to death and returning the stolen
    money. He was executed in public in Qasemabad district in Mashhad at 10 on
    the morning of July 6, 2005.
