    The execution of Ms. Akram Najafisahl was announced on the websites of the
    Kayhan newspaper (December 14, 2005), Group 8 Journalists (December 7),
    and ISNA (December 10). Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are unknown. The alleged crime was
    committed on December 4, 2001. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial, other than the trial took place at Branch 3 of the
    Shirvan Public Court (North Khorasan province). Charges According to the
    newspaper report, the charge against Ms. Akram Najafisahl was first degree
    murder for fatally stabbing Mariam Enteqal. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to
    death hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution states that the incentive for murder was that Ms.
    Nafisisahl wanted to marry a man, whose wife would not allow such a
    marriage. Defense No information is available on Ms. Najafisahl s defense.
    Judgment According to the Kayhan , Ms. Akram Najafisahl was sentenced to
    death. She was executed on December 7, 2005 in the Shirvan prison. She was
    21 at the time of execution; 17 at the time of the crime.
