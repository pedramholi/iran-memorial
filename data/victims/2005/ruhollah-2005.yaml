    News of the execution of Mr. Ruhollah, along with two other individuals,
    was published on the web sites of the Iran and the Sharq newspapers on
    November 21, 2005. Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. According to the Iran
    newspaper, “after the crime [kidnapping and rape of a 19-year old man] was
    committed, a police team was formed to arrest these individuals. After the
    arrest, the defendants were sent to the court.” The report did not specify
    the dates when the crime and arrest took place. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. The newspaper report did not specify
    the duration between the arrest and execution. It is not clear whether
    there was an appeal court. Charges According to the Iran newspaper,
    “police reported that three men named Yunes, Hossein, and Ruhollah, posing
    as taxi drivers, kidnapped and raped a nineteen year old man.” The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Ruhollah’s defense. Judgment The Iran
    newspaper stated, that in accordance with the court verdict, Mr. Ruhollah
    was executed at Dizelabad prison in Kermanshah at dawn on November 18,
    2005.
