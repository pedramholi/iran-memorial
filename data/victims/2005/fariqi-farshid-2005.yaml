    The news of the execution of Mr. Farshid Fariqi was published in the web
    editions of the Iran and the Hamshahri newspapers on August 18, 2005, and
    IRNA on July 26, 2005. According to the Iran newspaper, the defendant was
    21 years old when executed. Based on the information available in IRNA,
    the murders took place between 1998 and 2000. Therefore, the defendant was
    between 14 to 16 years old when the crimes took place. Mr. Farshid Fariqi
    is also on a list that Amnesty International published of people under18
    years of age who were executed in the Islamic Republic. Amnesty
    International repeatedly asked the judiciary officials in Iran to stop
    executing under-age offenders and to match Iranian laws with international
    laws for Human Rights. Iran has signed the International Covenant on Civil
    and Political Rights. Arrest and detention The Iran newspaper described
    the circumstance of the defendant s arrest as follows: The defendant named
    Farshid Fariqi with the pseudonym of Dariush Noruzi known as Salavati
    identified taxi drivers and established relationships with them in order
    to murder them and steal their valuables. After the murders, he stole
    their cars and escaped. After discovering the victims bodies, the Head of
    the Hormozgan Province Court House ordered the security forces to
    investigate and arrest the perpetrators of these murders. Finally, the
    security forces were able to arrest the defendant. There is no date of
    arrest in this report. Trial No information is available on the defendant
    s trial. Charges According to the Iran newspaper, the charges against Mr.
    Farshid Fariqi are assaulting and murdering Hojatollah Nazari and throwing
    him into a well, stabbing and murdering Abdi Zahedi, Reza Balideh, Ali
    Purhossain, and Akbar Dashtban, committing other robberies and using
    drugs. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant except
    what he confessed. According to the Iran newspaper, Farshid Fariqi
    confessed during interrogation stating, I got in as a passenger and talked
    to the drivers in order to attract their trust. Then, I stabbed and killed
    them, and stole their valuables. After the confession, the murderer
    recreated the crime scenes with details and described the stolen car
    models, the murder weapon, and the murders. International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Farshid Fariqi's defense. A Summary of the Defects of
    Mr. Farshid Fariqi s Legal Proceedings No precise information is available
    about the proceedings in Farshid Fariqi s case. However, based on the
    reports from domestic newspapers, he was sentenced to Qesas five times for
    having committed five intentional murders. According to an Iran Newspaper
    report, the defendant was 21 years old at the time of the implementation
    of his sentence in 2005-06. According to IRNA News Agency, the murders
    were committed between 1998 and 2000-01. This information indicates that
    the defendant was between 14 and 16 years old at the time of commission of
    the crime. It can therefore be said that some of these murders were
    committed when the murderer had not reached the age of majority and
    criminal responsibility, that is, 15 years. Pursuant to Iranian law, the
    age of majority is the age of criminal responsibility, which is 15 years
    for boys. If a male individual commits a crime when he is under the age of
    15, he has no criminal responsibility and he may simply be sentenced to
    correctional punishments. In this case, however, Farshid Fariqi was
    sentenced to Qesas even for murders he committed when he was under 15
    years of age. It was necessary for the court to conduct the necessary
    analysis and determine the precise time of each murder, which was
    apparently not done. Judgment According to the Iran newspaper, the judge
    of Homicide Branch of the Bandar-e Abbas Court House issued the execution
    judgment and the Supreme Court confirmed it. Mr. Farshid Fariqi was
    condemned to Qisas (death sentence) on five accounts, an execution by
    hanging, two years imprisonment, and 74 l
