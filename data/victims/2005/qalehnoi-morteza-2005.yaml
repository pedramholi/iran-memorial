circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Morteza Qal’eno’i, along with two other individuals,
    was announced on the web edition of the Khorasan newspaper on December 21,
    2005. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest
    and detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges The charge against Mr. Morteza Qal’eno’i was
    announced as "rape". The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on his
    defense. Judgment Branch 101 of the Sabzevar Criminal Court (Khorasan
    province) condemned the defendant to death and a branch of the Supreme
    Court confirmed the ruling. According to the Khorasan newspaper report,
    before the executions, the Revolutionary Public Prosecutor of Sabzevar
    talked about the Islamic punishments. Mr. Morteza Qal’eno’i was executed
    in public in the sports stadium of Sabzevar at 6:30 am on Tuesday December
    20, 2005 at the presence of some officials.
