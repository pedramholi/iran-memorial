    The execution of Ali Baba’ipur and another individual was published on the
    websites of the Javan newspaper, ISCANEWS , ISNA (December 18, 2005), and
    the Iran newspaper (December 19, 2005.) Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial According to ISNA , Tehran Criminal Prosecutor referred the case to
    the Tehran Public Penal Court. Charges According to the Iran newspaper,
    the charge against Mr. Babai’ipur was murdering his brother by a knife
    after he came from Hamedan to the Vali-e Asr district of Tehran in the
    spring of 2000. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not
    contain information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    ISNA , however, quotes the defendant saying: “When I went to my brother’s
    residence in Vali-e Asr district to reconcile but we quarreled and
    subsequently fought… I stabbed my brother three times. He lost his life
    due to the severity of the injuries.” Defense No information is available
    on Mr. Babai’ipur’s defense except that the defendant stated that he did
    not intend to kill his brother ( ISNA ). Judgment Branch 1601 of the
    Tehran Criminal Court condemned Mr. Ali Baba’ipur to death. The Supreme
    Court approved this sentence. In the Iranian Penal Code, murder is
    punishable by execution (retribution), giving the family of the victim the
    right to consent to the execution sentence or forgive the perpetrator. In
    this case, the officials carried out the sentence due to the fact that the
    parents of the victim, who are also the parents of the murderer, did not
    pardon him. Mr. Ali Baba’ipur was hanged at Evin prison on December 18,
    2005.
