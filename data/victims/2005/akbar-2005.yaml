    Mr. Akbar s (last name unknown) execution was been announced in the Sharq
    and Iran newspapers on August 3, 2005, Hamshahri , and the website of Iran
    on August 11, 2005. Arrest and detention According to Sharq , a man
    complained to the police station of Feiz Park, number 140, that his
    belongings were stolen from his vehicle. The matter was communicated to
    the patrol police. The police were patrolling the area when a van
    attracted their suspicion. The police followed the van and ordered it to
    stop. The van parked next to an under-construction building and the
    defendant ran out of the van and entered the building. The officers
    surrounded the building. The fugitive shot towards them, causing the death
    of a police officer. Other officers entered the building, and arrested the
    man, who was wounded. Trial No information is available on the defendant s
    trial other than after issuance of the verdict of Branch 1602 of Tehran
    Criminal Court, with the appeal of the defendant, the case was sent to
    Branch 4 of the Supreme Court ( Sharq ). Charges Mr. Akbar was charged
    with murder. Iran announced: On February 3, 2002, [the defendant] shot a
    police officer with a hunting gun at midnight. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped-up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt According to Hamshahri ,
    the defendant confessed to the killing of a young police officer and added
    that the same day he intended to steal tires and he had already stolen
    some. During the investigation, it was disclosed that the defendant had a
    criminal record of several armed robberies, attacking the police, and had
    been arrested and imprisoned previously. The Iran newspaper mentioned that
    his gun was discovered at the time of arrest. Defense No information is
    available on the defense. According to Hamshahri , Mr. Akbar stated that
    he shot the officer who followed him only to scare the police away and he
    did not intend to kill the officer. Judgment Branch 1602 of Tehran s
    Criminal Court condemned Mr. Akbar to death and 13 years imprisonment and
    the Supreme Court approved this ruling. Mr. Akbar was hanged in Evin
    prison on August 10, 2005.
