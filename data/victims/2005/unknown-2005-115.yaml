    News of the execution of an unknown individual was published in the Iran
    newspaper on September 13, 2005. This case was related to a rape in
    Kazerun in 2000. The defendant was only 17 when charged with the crime.
    International laws have strictly prohibited capital punishment against
    those who were under the age of 18 at the time of committing the crime. As
    a party to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention
    on the Rights of the Child, Iran has the obligation to avoid capital
    punishment for an offence committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of the defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial The defendant was tried in Fars province. No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges The charge brought against
    the defendant was announced as rape. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution did not provide any specific information on the
    evidence presented against the defendant. Defense This defendant was
    younger than 18 when the murder took place. No information is available on
    the defendant s defense. Judgment The court condemned the defendant to
    death. He was hanged in public at Shohada Square in Kazerun on September
    12, 2005 at 8 a.m.
