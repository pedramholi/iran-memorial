    Salehpur charged with murder. He reportedly set the body on fire. The

    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.

    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
