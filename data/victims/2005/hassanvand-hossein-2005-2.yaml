    News of the execution of Mr. Hossein Hassanvand, along with two other
    defendants*, was announced by the website of E temad daily on December 1,
    2005. Additional information on this case was obtained from Iran daily
    (August 25, 2004) and Jam-e Jam daily (June 5, 2002 September 22, 2002).
    According to the available information, Mr. Hassanvand s case, along with
    that of five other individuals, pertains to the Black Vultures criminal
    gang in Karaj. Arrest and detention According to the available
    information, when the parents of a dumb girl, as well as a number of other
    girls and young women, filed complaints to the police about the abduction,
    robbing of jewelry, harassment and rape of the girls and women by three
    men driving a red Paykan car in Karaj, Branch 119 of the Public Court of
    Karaj issued a warrant in the summer of 2002 for the apprehension of the
    Paykan and arrest of its driver/riders. After obtaining the physiognomy of
    the accused from the plaintiffs, the police identified the red Paykan in
    the Quds Square of Karaj on July 16, 2002, and started to peruse it. The
    police arrested the riders of the car, including Mr. Hassanvand, in
    Mohammad Shahr of Karaj. Trial Mr. Hassanvand was tried, in the presence
    of his defense lawyer, as the tertiary suspect by Branch 1601 of the
    Public Court, along with two other defendants of this case (Jam-e Jam
    daily). However, there is no information available on the details of the
    session or sessions of their trial. Charges There is no information
    available on the details of the charges brought against Mr. Hassanvand.
    However, according to the available information, Mr. Hassanvand and the
    other defendants of this case were charged with abduction, harassment and
    rape of women. He and the other two were accused of abducting women and
    young girls in the guise of taxi drivers, robbing them of their jewelry
    and other belongings through the use of force, harassing and sexually
    abusing them, and then letting them go in the plains around Karaj and
    Tehran (Iran daily, August 25, 2004). The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt According to the
    available information, the confessions of the defendant were entered as
    evidence of guilt against Mr. Hassanvand. He himself admitted to
    committing 40 counts of various crimes (Jam-e Jam daily, June 5, 2002).
    The complaints of the plaintiffs were also among the evidence of guilt
    entered against him (Iran daily, August 25, 2004). However, there is no
    further information available on the details of the evidence of guilt
    entered against Mr. Hassanvand. Defense There is no information available
    on the details of Mr. Hassanvand s defense. Judgment Branch 1601 of the
    Public Court sentenced Mr. Hossein Hassanvand as the tertiary suspect of
    the case to imprisonment and public execution (Jam-e Jam daily). The
    verdict was validated by the Supreme Court. Mr. Hassanvand was moved in a
    police car to the site of execution at 7:15 on November 30, 2005. After he
    had been handcuffed from behind, Mr. Hassanvand was publicly hanged in the
    area of the Azadegan Park in Islamabad of Karaj. ---------------------- *
