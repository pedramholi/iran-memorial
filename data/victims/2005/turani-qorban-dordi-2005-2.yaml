    Mr. Qorban Dordi Turani was a Turkmen. He was 53, he was married, and he
    had children. He had changed his religion from Islam to Christianity. He
    lived in Gonbad-e Kavus, he held church sevices in his home, and he taught
    Christianity. Information regarding the extrajudicial killing of Mr.
    Qorban Dordi Turani has been obtained from Campus Direct News news service
    (December 6, 2005). News about this murder was also published in Crosswalk
    Website (November 30, 2005) and (BC?) News Life website (November 29,
    2005). Additional information has been collected from Voice of America
    Website (December 8, 2005), Iran va Jahan Website (December 6, 2005),
    Farsi Net Website (Dec 2006 Jan 2007), and ISNA News Service (March 12,
    2018). Mr. Qorban Dordi Turani was a Turkman. He was 53, he was married,
    and he had children (Campus Direct News, December 6, 2005; Voice of
    America, December 8, 2005). He was born in Gonbad-e Kavus, into a family
    who were Sunni-Hanafi. He had seven siblings. After he completed his high
    school education, he would have liked to go to Egypt for religious
    studies. However, he could not afford to do this, so he pursued the study
    of Islam on his own. Eventually, he became an atheist and he became
    interested in Marxism (Campus Direct News, December 6, 2005). Sometime in
    1982, Mr. Dordi Turani went to Turkmenistan in search of work. According
    to Campus Direct News news service, that same year, Mr. Dordi Turani was
    accused of killing someone in self-defence and he was sentenced to 15
    years in prison. In prison, he became a Christian. In 1997, he was
    released from prison, and he returned to Iran. According to Campus Direct
    News news service, upon his return to Iran, Mr. Dordi Turani began to
    teach the Christian Faith openly and actively. This news service reports
    that in the first two years of his teaching activity, Mr. Dordi Turani had
    been able to convert 12 Turkmen citizens to Christianity. In order to
    carry out his activities, he managed a church in his home (Campus Direct
    News, December 6, 2005). Background of Extrajudicial Killings by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history
    of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world. Since the
    1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside the
    country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since
    then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has
    so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases there has not been much published and
    the local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
    evidence, and traces obtained through investigations conducted by local
    police and judicial authorities confirm, however, the theory of state
    committed crimes. In certain cases, these investigations have resulted in
    the expulsion or arrest of Iranian diplomats. In limited cases outside
    Iran, the perpetrators of these murders have been arrested and put on
    trial and the evidence presented, revealed the defendants connection to
    Iran s government institutions, and an arrest warrant has been issued for
    Iran s Minister of Information. The manner in which these killings were
    organized and implemented in Iran and abroad, is indicative of a single
    pattern which, according to Roland Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor,
    contains common parameters and detailed planning. It can be ascertained
    from the similarities between these murders in different countries that
    the Iranian government is the principal entity who ordered the
    implementation of these crimes. Iranian authorities have not officially
    accepted responsibility for these murders and have even attributed their
    commission to internal strife in opposition groups. Nevertheless, since
    the very inception of the Islamic Republic regime, the Islamic Republic
    officials have justified these crimes from an ideological and legal
    standpoint. In the spring of 1979, Sadeq Khalkhali, the first Chief Shari
    a Judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts, officially announced the
    regime s decision to implement extrajudicial executions, and justified the
    decision: These people have been sentenced to death; from the Iranian
    people s perspective, if someone wants to assassinate these individuals
    abroad, in any country, no government has any right to bring the
    perpetrator to trial as a terrorist, because such a pers
