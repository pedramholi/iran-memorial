    Information about Mr. Jamal Edris Albu Ebadi was taken from a list of
    individuals killed during protests in Khuzestan, between April 15thand
    30th, 2005. The list was reported by the European Ahwazi Human Rights
    Organization, which includes the names and details of 64 Arab citizens of
    Khuzestan, who were killed by security and police forces during popular
    protests in Arab-populated towns. Additional information about these
    protests has been gathered from interviews conducted by the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Foundation, with several eyewitnesses and from a report by Milan
    Kothari, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, as
    well as reports by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Ahvaz Human
    Rights Organization, Ahvaz News Agency, Iranian Students News Agency
    (ISNA), Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), and news websites including
    the BBC and Gooya News.* Based on the available information, Mr. Albu
    Ebadi was killed in April 2005 by security and police forces during
    protests in Khuzestan. The Officials Reaction Iranian state and judiciary
    authorities did not provide clear information regarding the number or
    names of the individuals killed during the Khuzestan protests. Some of the
    state officials acknowledged in a general statement that some citizens had
    been killed but did not provide further information. Ali Shamkhani, the
    Minister of Defense at the time, who was present in Khuzestan as the
    representative of the state, announced the number of individuals killed to
    be three or four (ISNA, April 19, 2005). On April 20, 2005, 180 members of
    the seventh parliament wrote a letter to Seyyed Mohammad Khatami, Iran s
    president at the time, to demand restitution for the harms brought upon
    the people of Ahvaz and the release of innocent detainees who, according
    to the parliamentarians, were mostly teenage students and young people. In
    an April 25, 2005 letter to Mohammad Khatami, Iran s president at the
    time, Jasem Shadidzadeh, Secretary General of the Wefaq Party and
    Representative of Ahvaz in the sixth parliament, demanded that the bodies
    of the victims be delivered to their families as soon as possible for
    proper funeral and customary mourning ceremonies. According to reports by
    local activists and human rights organizations, such as Amnesty
    International, security officials gave the news of the death of some of
    the protest detainees to the families. Some of the eyewitnesses of the
    protests explicitly remarked, in their interviews with the Boroumand
    Foundation, that the security forces actively prevented the delivery of
    the victims bodies to their families, for quite some time, and had, in
    some cases, summoned and threatened the families. According to a Human
    Rights Watch report, in some cases the officials had demanded that the
    families pay a 50 million riyal fine (later reduced to 15 million riyals)
    for damage sustained by government buildings during the protests, before
    they could receive the victims bodies -- although it is reported that,
    even after the payment of the fine by the families, state officials only
    allowed the delivery of two bodies per week (Human Rights Watch, May 10,
    2005). The Family s Remarks No information regarding remarks or reactions
    by Mr. Albu Ebadi s family is available. A Brief Description of Arab
    Protests in Khuzestan On Friday, April 15, 2005, protests ensued,
    initially, in the Kui-e Alavi (Shelangabad) neighborhood of Ahvaz and
    continued widely for several days to other parts of Ahvaz, Mahshahr, and
    Hamidiyeh, in response to the publication of a July 24, 1998, letter,
    attributed to Mohammad Ali Abtahi, the head of the President s Office at
    the time, calling for a demographic restructuring of the Arab population
    in Khuzestan, encouraging the immigration of non-Arab people to the
    region, and reducing the Arab population of Khuzestan to one-third of the
    total population of the province. Even though, on Saturday, April 16th,
    the spokesperson for the Iranian government officially denied the
    authenticity of the letter, the protests that had ensued, following the
    invitation of the Committee for Organizing Popular Protests in Ahvaz, **
    (a committee consisting of some political groups, cultural institutions,
    civil institutions, and some Khuzestan Arab political and civil activists)
    continued widely. In the call for protests, the following factors were
    mentioned: policies by the central government to confiscate the lands
    belonging to Arab farmers, through various projects such as the Sugarcane
    Project; increasing marginalization as well as profound dissatisfaction
    among Khuzestan Arabs due to government efforts to eradicate the Arab
    identity; and uprooting the Arabs of Khuzestan. Historical Background
    Iranian Arabs, some 2 to 3 million individuals, comprising
    approximately*** 3% of the country s population, reside in Khuzestan,
    Bushehr, Hormozgan, Fars, and Khorasan provinces. The largest number of
    Arabs reside in the Southern and Western regions of Khuzestan. Although
