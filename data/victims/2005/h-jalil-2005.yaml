    Information about the execution of Mr. Jalil H., known as Jenadeleh, along
    with another person, was published by the Iranian Student News Agency
    (ISNA), and on the website of the Iran newspaper on December 27, 2005, and
    on the web site of the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) on December 28.
    Arrest and Detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant’s trial. Charges According the report of the Public Relations
    Office of the Judiciary of Khuzestan Province, the defendant was charged
    with “participation in an armed robbery using a combat weapon, shooting,
    and stealing.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have
    brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed
    them for alleged drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common
    criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet international
    standards. The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on the defense. Judgment
    According to the media reports, Mr. Jalil H. was condemned to death in
    public by Branch Three of Ahvaz Revolutionary Court for being “at war with
    God.” After the ruling was confirmed by Branch 32 of the Supreme Court, he
    was executed in the Serahtapeh District of Ahvaz on December 28, 2005.
