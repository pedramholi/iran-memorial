    A number of websites and weblogs reported on Mr. Ashian s death. These
    online sources include the website of the Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan, the website of the Worker-communist Party of Iran, and the
    Didgahha website. In addition, an interview with a person close to Mr.
    Ashian s family provided some information regarding his personal life. Mr.
    Ashian was born in a middle-class family in Sanandaj. He lost his father
    when he was very young. After finishing the 10th grade he started working
    as a technician. He supported the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan
    (PDKI), and two of his brothers were PDKI peshmerga. As a result, Mr.
    Ashian and his family were always subject to scrutiny and harassment by
    intelligence officers based in Sanandaj. On August 6, 2005 Mr. Ashian and
    a friend were distributing leaflets inviting Sanandaj residents to join a
    general strike in Kurdish regions on the next day. The strike was planned
    to protest the death of Kamal Asfarm (also known as Schwaneh Qaderi).
    Based on the information provided in a weblog , security forces fired at
    Mr. Ashian and his friend when they attempted to flee after being stopped.
    Mr. Ashian was shot, and he died hours later at Tohid hospital in
    Sanandaj. Following Mr. Qaderi s killing in early July 2005 by security
    forces in Mahabad, some pictures of his tortured body were distributed on
    the internet. These pictures triggered an uprising in Mahabad. The
    protests soon spread to other Kurdish cities of Iran such as Sardasht,
    Baneh, Piranshahr, Sanandaj and Saqqez. According to the existing
    information, the protests began at 9 a.m. on August 2, 2005 following the
    distribution of a night letter in Mahabad. But the peak of the clashes
    occurred between 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Afterwards, the city regained stability
    after intervention from security and police forces. Many people were
    killed and a large number were wounded. In addition, many civil activists
    were arrested. The protests went on for weeks despite the harsh repression
    by the government s security forces, during at which protesters destroyed
    various State-owned properties (Amnesty International, February 16, 2006).
