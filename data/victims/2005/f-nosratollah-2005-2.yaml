    News of the execution of Mr. Nosratollah F. along with two other people
    was published on the web edition of the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on August
    11, 2005, and in the Javan newspaper on August 10, 2005. This news has
    also been reflected in an interview of the Head of Hamadan Province Court
    House with IRNA. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant
    s arrest and detention are not known. The date of arrest is not mentioned
    in the newspapers reports. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges The charges against Mr. Nosratollah F. were
    announced as possessing 360 grams of heroin and selling 3 kilograms of
    opium. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped-up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Nosratollah F. s defense. Judgment No
    information is available on the details of this judgment. According to the
    newspapers and a quotation by the Head of Hamadan Province Court House,
    Mr. Nosratollah F. was hanged, as a "death trader," at dawn on Tuesday
    August 9, 2005.
