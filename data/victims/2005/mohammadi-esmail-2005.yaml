    News of the execution of Mr. Esma'il Mohammadi and another individual was
    published by the Human Rights Organization of Kurdistan. Additional
    information about this case was obtained through an Abdorrahman Boroumand
    Center interview with Mr. Mohammadi s spouse (Boroumand Center interview),
    the Secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Kurdistan s conversation
    with Radio Farda (September 6, 2005), and Amnesty International press
    releases (August 8, 2003, August 24, 2004, September 7, 2005). Mr.
    Mohammadi was an ethnic Kurd from the Town of Saqqez village of
    Tikantappeh, married, residing in the town of Bukan, and had 5 children
    from two marriages. He was a communist and held no religious beliefs.
    (Boroumand Center interview). In 1981, Mr. Mohammadi became a member of
    the Komeleh Party of Iranian Kurdistan and went to Iraqi Kurdistan. A year
    later, in 1982, he returned to Iran as a surrendering member but continued
    to work with Komeleh s secret organization in Bukan. In the year 2000, Mr.
    Mohammadi went to Iraqi Kurdistan once again with his family, and joined
    the Komeleh Party s headquarters in Iraqi Kurdistan. (Boroumand Center
    interview). Several remaining members of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of
    Iran established the Revolutionary Organization of this party in Iraq in
    the mid 1960s. Esma il Sharifzadeh, Abdollah Mo ini, and Molaavareh were
    among the leaders of this organization who, inspired by the Cuban
    Revolution, began an armed guerrilla struggle in Kurdistan. When this
    group was defeated in 1969 and several of its members were arrested, armed
    struggle was criticized and the Maoist trend overcomes. When some of its
    leaders were released in 1978, the Revolutionary Organization of Working
    People in Kurdistan Komala was established. Based on Marxist theory,
    Komala was against the capitalists and landlords and encouraged workers
    and peasants in Kurdistan to an armed uprising against them and the
    central government. This organization considered the Kurdish Democratic
    Party of Iran (PDKI) as the rich party and campaigned against it,
    resulting in several armed conflicts and hundreds dead. In 1982, Komala
    joined another Marxist group, Sahand, which was basically a theoretical
    group, and established the Communist Party of Iran. Then it became called
    the Kurdistan Organization of the Communist Party of Iran Komala. Years
    later, this organization separated from the Communist Party of Iran and
    faced several schisms. The Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan, led by
    Abdollah Mohtadi, Komala, and the Kurdistan Organization of the Communist
    Party of Iran led by Ebrahim Alizadeh are some of these factions. Arrest
    and detention Based on available information, in May 2002, [the town of]
    Piranshahr Information Administration agents arrested Mr. Mohammadi at his
    friend s home in Bukan and took him to Piranshahr Information
    Administration offices. Mr. Mohammadi had gone to Iran on a mission for
    the Party. He was held for five months in Information Administration
    detention centers in Piranshahr, Mahabad, and Bukan, without access to an
    attorney, and according to his family, had been subjected to physical and
    psychological torture during that period which resulted in a broken hand
    and a broken nose as a result of being struck and beaten with a rifle
    stock. Mr. Mohammadi was deprived of the right to contact and visit with
    his family during his detention at the Information Administration
    detention centers, and his family had no knowledge of where he was being
    held. He was able to contact and visit with his father s family after he
    was transferred to [the city of] Orumieh Prison, but his wife and children
    could not visit with him as they were at Komeleh headquarters in Iraqi
    Kurdistan. (Boroumand Center interview). After Mr. Mohammadi s sentence
    was confirmed, his wife secretly traveled to Iran only once, and was able
    to meet him for 30 minutes in person at Orumieh Prison, using her sister s
    birth certificate. He was brought to visitations with his family in
    shackles. (Boroumand Center interview). Mr. Mohammadi spent 5 years in
    prison. Trial Orumieh Revolutionary Court Branch one tried Mr. Mohammadi.
    According to his wife, he was tried 3 times and had an attorney but there
    is no information about whether his attorney was present at trial. Charges
    According to the Amnesty International press release, Mr. Esma'il
    Mohammadi s charges were armed struggle against the Islamic regime,
    Moharebeh ( waging war against God ), Efsad fel-Arz ( spreading corruption
    on Earth ), membership in Komeleh, illegal passage through the border, and
    participation in the kidnapping, torture, and killing of at least one
    government employee. According to Mr. Mohammadi s family, he was accused
    by the court to have acted in assassinating a former member of Komeleh who
    was cooperating with the Islamic Republic, and had assassinated his
    brother. (Boroumand Center interview). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascert
