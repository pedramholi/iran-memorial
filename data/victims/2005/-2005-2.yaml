    The news of the execution of an unknown person was published in the web
    edition of the Kayhan newspaper on May 24, 2005. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are unknown. The
    date of the defendant’s arrest is not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges “The Student Network” is
    quoted in the Kayhan newspaper stating, “this individual who was a taxi
    driver was charged with seduction and rape of several girls and women in
    Zahedan.” The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged
    common criminals, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on the defendant's defense. Judgment No details
    are available about the execution sentence. According to Kayhan , he was
    executed publicly in Zahedan Station on May 23, 2005.
