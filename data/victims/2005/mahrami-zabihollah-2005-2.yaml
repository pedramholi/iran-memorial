    Information regarding Mr. Zabihollah (also spelled "Dhabihu llah") Mahrami
    has been taken from the verdict of the court (Jan. 2, 1996), websites of
    Baha i Online Library (Feb. 29, 1996), Baha i World News (Dec. 19, 2005),
    Radio Farda (Dec. 19, 2005), Amnesty International (Oct. 1996, and Dec.
    22, 2005), Didgah-ha referring to a Radio Farda report (Dec. 24, 2005),
    and Akhbar-Rooz (May 4, 2006). Mr. Mahrami, son of Gholam Reza, was born
    in 1946 to a Baha i family in Yazd. He was married and had four children.
    Before the Islamic Revolution he worked at the Ministry of Agriculture.
    After the Revolution he worked there until he was, as many other Baha is,
    dismissed from his work place. At the time of arrest, he made a living
    installing venetian blinds (Baha i World News). During his 10-year long
    detention he received several death threats (Baha i sources and Amnesty
    International). In 1996 Amnesty International recognized him as a prisoner
    of conscience and campaigned for his immediate and unconditional release.
    The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of
    the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious
    community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300
    thousand members in 1979*- to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.** Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to
    the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention The exact date of Mr.
    Mahrami s arrest is not known. The court verdict mentioned that on June 1,
    1995 the Ministry of Information submitted a report to the court stating
    that Mr. Mahrami s daughter married a Baha i man. The order of guidance
    [i.e. the court summons] for Mr. Mahrami was issued by the Head of the
    Islamic Revolutionary Court of Yazd on July 24, 1995 and sent to the
    Intelligence Ministry. Whether or not his daughter s wedding triggered
    this court order is not known. According to one of his relatives, for 40
    days his family was unaware of his detention location (Akhbar-Rooz). This
    source states, he was forced to perform difficult [physical] labor in
    Abarqu and Ardekan prisons so much that as a result of the arduous labor,
    he had to undergo a surgery on his knee in Abarqu prison. In the last
    years of his imprisonment, he had temporary leaves of absence from prison.
    Trial The court verdict mentioned a brief of the proceedings. The first
    session of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Yazd took place on August
    16, 1995 where Mr. Mahrami stated that he was a member of the Baha i
    community. After this session, the court held three meetings (Oct. 3, Oct.
    14, and Dec. 19, 1995) in an endeavor to guide him to the right path of
    Islam and for him to convert to Islam and denounce the Baha i Faith. Each
    time, Mr. Mahrami remained steadfast in his religious beliefs: After
    holding three consecutive meetings for guiding him [to the truth], despite
    the fact that he was given ample time to study the situation and to accept
    the suggestion [of this court] to be sent to a learned individual for
    investigating the shallow foundations of his beliefs, he refused to do so
    and, regardless of the tremendous efforts [of this court] towards
    encouraging him to repent for having committed the most grievous sin,
    i.e., apostasy, [the court] did not succeed [in its efforts] because of
    the enmity and the stubbornness of this individual. After the last
    meeting, Mr. Mahrami was permitted to be represented by an attorney in the
    next court session on January 2, 1996 at Branch One of the Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Yazd. At this session, too, Mr. Mahrami remained
    loyal to his religion; the Court issued its verdict the same day. Charges
    According to the court ruling of January 2, 1996, Mr. Mahrami was char
