    News and information regarding the execution of Mr. Abdorreza Akbari Diba,
    son of Kheirollah, was sent to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center by a person
    who knew him (March 31, 2021). The news of his execution along with Mr.
    Farhad Akbari Diba , was also announced on the websites of the Central
    Prosecutor s Office, the Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) of Markazi
    province (Dec. 7, 2005), and the Iran newspaper (Dec. 10, 2005). The
    report of this newspaper is vague and does not provide clear information
    about the events that resulted in the arrest of Mr. Akbari Diba. Mr.
    Akbari Diba was a resident of the Asadabad village near Hamedan. Arrest
    and Detention According to Iran , Mr. Abdorreza Akbari Diba went to the
    police station in Saveh (Marzaji province) in order to pick up his damaged
    car. This car had tipped off the road in an accident and was seized by the
    police. The officials had learned that the occupants of the car were
    wanted for armed robbery; therefore, they arrested Mr. Akbari Diba. Trial
    Branch two of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Arak (Markazi province)
    tried Mr. Akbari Diba. Charges Mr. Abdorreza Akbari Diba was charged with
    armed robbery and murder . According to Arak Prosecutor, Messers Akabrinia
    were blocking the roads from Arak to Khomein, Zanjan, Takestan, Mianeh,
    Nobaran in Saveh, and Shustar for extortion, frightening people, and
    murder . (Central Prosecutor s Office and ISNA - Dec. 7, 2005) The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for alleged
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Mr. Akbari Diba except
    for his confession. According to Iran , while in custody, he had confessed
    to extortion and armed robbery in the vicinity of Saveh and disclosed the
    details of a horrible crime at Khomein intersection. No further
    information is available. International human rights organizations have
    repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for
    its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to obtain
    confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Akbari Diba s defense. Judgment The
    Public Prosecutor of Arak called Mr. Abdorreza Akbari Diba at war with God
    and a corruptor on earth. He was hanged in the presence of the victims
    families and other observers at the place of the crime (the fifth
    kilometer into Arak-Khomein road) on December 7, 2005.
