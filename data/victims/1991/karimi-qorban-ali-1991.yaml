    News of the execution of Mr. Qorbanali Karimi, son of Hajibaba was
    published in Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on April 21, 1991. Additional
    information was obtained through the Boroumand Foundation s research and
    interviews with people with knowledge of the case. Mr. Karimi was 31, from
    and residing in [the city of] Arak, married, with several children. He was
    a tall and husky man, and was a well-known and reputable individual where
    he lived. Mr. Karimi s profession was laying asphalt pavements. Mr. Karimi
    s case is related to crimes involving drugs. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Karimi was arrested in 1988-89 in Arak at the home of one of his
    relatives. He had gone to one of his relatives home, not knowing that the
    police were waiting for him there. When he went inside, the owner of the
    house told the police: This is the Qorbanali that you are looking for.
    According to an acquaintance, Mr. Karimi did not know why he had been
    arrested and thought that there had been a mistake. He therefore told his
    family that he would be released very soon because he was innocent. He was
    interrogated and tortured for nine months but did not give a confession.
    According to the testimony of a person close to Mr. Karimi, he was taken
    to the investigating judge s office, who orally notified him of his
    release due to a lack of evidence. Mr. Karimi became angry and said in
    protest: Why did you beat me so much when you knew I had nothing [and hadn
    t done anything]? and proceeded to hit the judge in the head with a desk.
    Reacting to his action, the judge said: I will put the rope around your
    neck [and hang you] myself. (Boroumand Foundation interview). After a
    period of interrogations, Mr. Karimi was transferred to Arak Prison. Given
    his professional specialty, he paved the Arak Prison s grounds with
    asphalt. Trial Arak Islamic Revolutionary Court tried Mr. Karimi. No
    information is available about the details of the trial session(s).
    Charges Mr. Karimi was charged with the purchase, sale, and distribution
    of one kilogram of heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of proscribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The testimony of another prisoner who had been arrested 2 years
    prior to Mr. Karimi was used against him as evidence. That individual had
    been executed before Mr. Karimi s arrest. (Boroumand Foundation
    interview). There is no information regarding other evidence submitted in
    court against Mr. Karimi. Defense Mr. Karimi never admitted the charge
    brought against him and there was no evidence against him. The person who
    had testified against him was a prisoner who had been executed prior to
    Mr. Karimi s arrest, and there was therefore no possibility of him being
    present in court [to testify]. According to the testimony of a person
    close to Mr. Karimi, the order to release him had reached judicial
    authorities but they did not pay any attention to it. (Boroumand
    Foundation interview). Judgment Mr. Karimi was sentenced to death and
    expropriation of property. The sentence was approved by the country s
    Prosecutor General. Mr. Qorbanali Karimi was executed on April 20, 1991,
    in Arak Prison. His wife and his three young children were incarcerated at
    the time of his execution. According to the statements of an acquaintance,
    Mr. Karimi s wife had been arrested and charged with possession of drugs
    in order to put pressure on Mr. Karimi to make a confession. (Boroumand
    Foundation interview). Mr. Karimi s assets consisted of a Paykan 48
    [Iranian brand of car] which was expropriated. According to a person close
    to him, the order of his release arrived from Tehran two months after he
    was executed. (Boroumand Foundation interview).
