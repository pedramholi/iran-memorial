    For Abdorrahman Borumand, Democracy meant the rule of the majority, while
    all political and social rights of the minority are respected so that the
    minority gets the opportunity to become the majority. Information
    regarding the life and death of Dr. Abdorrahman Borumand (Borumand) was
    taken from interviews of Abdorrahman Borumand Center for Human Rights
    (ABC) with his daughters Ladan (December 2, 2005) and Roya (March 30,
    2024), a March 6, 1984, interview with Abdorrahman Borumand in France by
    the Harvard Oral History Project, and an interview of Ladan Borumand with
    Asoo, November 29, 2018. Additional information was drawn from his case s
    investigation in France, the investigation of the assassinations known as
    the Chain Murders, in Freedom Vatan Blogspot (2009,) the official weekly
    of the National Movement of the Iranian Resistance in Paris, Ghiame-Iran,
    June 10, 1991, Kayhan daily, April 23, 1991, Jomhuri Eslami daily,
    September 18, 1991, Le Monde daily June 22, 1991, and ABC s research and
    April 18, 2016 Newsletter: Remembering One Anniversary and Celebrating
    Another: Twenty-five Years Ago, a Man Was Assassinated in Paris, but His
    Cause Lives On. Dr. Abdorrahman Borumand, son of Mohammad Khan, was
    married and had four children. He was born into a farmer/landowner family
    from Esfahan in 1927. After completing his high school education in
    Esfahan, he studied law at the University of Tehran and graduated in 1948.
    He began his military service the same year. He served in the Military
    Academy and the judiciary, in Esfahan. After the end of his service (March
    1950), he left for Switzerland where he obtained his Ph.D. from the
    University of Geneva in 1956. (Harvard Interview- ABC interview with Ladan
    Borumand) He returned to Iran and settled down in his home town Esfahan.
    He practiced law until the 1979 revolution. In the early 1970s he and his
    brothers entered into an agreement with a developer and began a big
    housing project on parts of their land near Esfahan. Dr. Borumand s
    condition for agreeing to this project was to include affordable housing
    for low-income families. Out of the first 5000 units built before the
    revolution in this new development (Shahin-shahr), ended the project, 2000
    units allowed families to be homeowners for the first time.(Harvard
    interview) Political Career Dr Borumand began his political activism in
    University. He explained in an interview years later, that though the
    occupation of Iran by the allies during World War II had been a blow to
    Iranians morale, it also led to a political opening that outlasted the
    occupation and brought excitement and hope to them. In Switzerland, he and
    other supporters of Prime Minister Mosaddeq (1951-1953) spent most of
    their time undoing ؛the poisonous attacks of the Tudeh Party supporters
    who accused Mosaddeq to be England s servant and associated with
    imperialism. While studying in Geneva, he wrote a statement on behalf of
    his fellow students against the overthrow of Mosaddeq in 1953, which led
    the Iranian Embassy to file a complaint against him with the Swiss
    authorities for insulting the Head of the state. In response, Dr. Borumand
    stressed that insults are used by people who have nothing worthy to say.
    (Harvard Project interview) Dr. Borumand returned to Iran in July 1956 at
    a time when many Mosaddeq supporters were in prison or inactive. His first
    political contact was Dr. Shapur Bakhtiar whom he reached out to through
    family connections. He never joined any political party but was a member
    of the National Front, the pro-Mosaddeq s coalition. In 1960, signals of a
    political opening, encouraged the National Front to present candidates to
    the parliament. Dr. Borumand ran in Esfahan in August, but the political
    police arrested him on the second day of the election and sent him to
    Qezel Qal eh Prison in Tehran for a few days before releasing him (Harvard
    Oral History). However, new elections were held in January 1961, after all
    the elected candidates resigned and the political police (SAVAK) was
    apparently instructed not to intervene. (US Consulate Esfahan, 1961
    Report) Dr. Borumand ran again, despite the limitations imposed by the
    city officials including preventing the National Front candidates to use
    the location of their choice for their campaign headquarter or stopping
    the sound-truck that dispensed their slogans after it circulated in
    Esfahan for a day. The U.S. consulate reported that the authorities
    rejected the candidates' demands that all the ballot boxes be sealed in
    the presence of their representatives and ballots be read in the latter s
    presence. It also noted that the candidates campaign grew rapidly to draw
    up to 2000 people from different classes every night. Groups of students,
    farmers, factory workers, and intellectuals attended at different nights,
    as per the candidates demands. During the first day of the election,
    January 26, 1961, it was reported that the political police had prevented
    the workers from leaving the factories.
