    Information about the extrajudicial killing of Mr. Seyed Miramin (Amin)
    Miramini was published in the Mojahedin e Khalq Organization Website
    (December 26, 2016). Additional information on this case was taken from
    Asoo Website (February 1, 2019), Eshterak Website (August 17, 2019),
    Northern Committee of Mazandaran Tigers Weblog (August 18 and August 31,
    2010), The Secret Organization of Armed Youth Weblog (February 26, 2006),
    Asr e Ehanat Weblog (April 12, 2006), and Nika News (June 23, 2015). Mr.
    Seyed Miramin (Amin) Miramini was from the town of Galugah in Mazandaran
    (Mojahedin e Khalq Organization Website, December 26, 2016). He was a
    supporter of the People s Loyalty Organization of Iran (Majority)
    (Northern Committee Weblog, August 18, 2010). According to available
    information, he had spent part of the 80s in prison and he was one of the
    people who escaped the killing of political prisoners in the summer of
    1988 (1) (Asoo Website, February 1, 2019; Eshterak Website, August 17,
    2019). The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization - Majority The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group, inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    Revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The
    Fadaiyan Khalq Majority considered the Islamic Republic as a revolutionary
    and anti-imperialist regime and supported it. After the spring of 1983,
    however, the Islamic Republic targeted its members solely because of their
    political beliefs. The Keshtgar faction (also known as 16 Azar faction)
    split from the Majority branch on December 7, 1981, due to its opposition
    to uniting with the Tudeh Party. Background of Extrajudicial Killings by
    the Islamic Republic of Iran The Islamic Republic of Iran has a long
    history of politically motivated violence in Iran and around the world.
    Since the 1979 Revolution, Islamic Republic operatives inside and outside
    the country have engaged in kidnapping, disappearing, and killing a large
    number of individuals whose activities they deemed undesirable. The actual
    number of the victims of extrajudicial killings inside Iran is not clear;
    however, these murders began in February 1979 and have continued since
    then, both inside and outside Iran. The Abdorrahman Boroumand Center has
    so far identified over 540 killings outside Iran attributed to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. Dissidents have been assassinated by the agents of the
    Islamic Republic outside Iran in countries such as the Philippines,
    Indonesia, Japan, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Dubai, Iraq, and Turkey in
    the Middle East; Cyprus, France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
    Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain in Europe; and the United States across
    the Atlantic Ocean. In most cases there has not been much published and
    the local authorities have not issued arrest warrants. But documentation,
    evidence, and traces obtained through investigations conducted by local
    police and judicial authorities confirm, however, the theory of state
    committed crimes. In certain cases, these investigations have resulted in
    the expulsion or arrest of Iranian diplomats. In limited cases outside
    Iran, the perpetrators of these murders have been arrested and put on
    trial and the evidence presented, revealed the defendants connection to
    Iran s government institutions, and an arrest warrant has been issued for
    Iran s Minister of Information. The manner in which these killings were
    organized and implemented in Iran and abroad, is indicative of a single
    pattern which, according to Roland Chatelin, the Swiss prosecutor,
    contains common parameters and detailed planning. It can be ascertained
    from the similarities between these murders in different countries that
    the Iranian government is the principal entity who ordered the
    implementation of these crimes. Iranian authorities have not officially
    accepted responsibility for these murders and have even attributed their
    commission to internal strife in opposition groups. Nevertheless, since
    the very inception of the Islamic Republic regime, the Islamic Republic
    officials have justified these crimes from an ideological and legal
    standpoint. In the spring of 1979, Sadeq Khalkhali, the first Chief Shari
    a Judge of the Islamic Revolutionary Courts, officially announced the
    regime s decision to implement extrajudicial executions, and justified the
    decision: These people have been sentenced to death; from the Iranian
    people s perspective, if someone wants to assassinate these individuals
    abroad, in any country, no government has any right to bring the
    perpetrator to trial as a terrorist, because such a person is the
    implementing agent of the sentence issued by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Court. Therefore, they are Mahduroddam and their sentence is death
    regardless of where they are. More than 10 years after these
