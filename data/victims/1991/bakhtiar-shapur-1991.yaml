    Born in a tribe in Lorestan, home to one of Iran s oldest tribes, he was
    loyal, strong headed, and courageous. But, he was also humble: I am first
    a human being, then an Iranian, and then a Muslim. Information regarding
    the life and death of Mr. Shapur (also spelled Chapur) Bakhtiar was taken

    five, was born on June 26, 1914 in a mountainous area in Chaharmahal and
    Bakhtiari Province to an influential family of the Bakhtiari tribe. He was
    sent to Shahr-e Kord to attend primary school and attended high school in
    Esfahan and Beirut. He completed his education in France, with an
    interruption of two years following the execution of his father in Iran,
    and in 1939 obtained his BA in law, philosophy, and political science
    while studying simultaneously in three universities. His studies were
    interrupted by World War II during which he joined the French army in 1940
    and then the resistance to German occupiers. He did doctoral studies in
    law and political science and obtained a PhD in law in 1945 and returned
    to Iran in January 1946 (Shapur Bakhtiar s Memoirs: Ma Fidelite, Albin
    Michel 1982). During his stay in France, he married his first wife, a
    French citizen, and had his first two children. In the years after their
    return to Iran, he and his wife had four children. In the 1950s, Dr.
    Bakhtiar's wife separated from him, and she returned to France. Mr.
    Bakhtiar raised the children with the help of his older daughter, Vivian;
    a task made difficult by his multiple imprisonments. In the 1980s, while
    in France, Mr. Bakhtiar married again and had another child, who was five
    at the time of his death. His daughter France remembers him as a cheerful,
    warm, brave and generous man; a flame that will never die. (2010 interview
    with VOA TV) Upon his return to Iran, in the period 1946-1948, he was
    hired in the newly formed Ministry of Labor and appointed to head the
    Labor Departments in the provinces of Isfahan and then Khuzestan, where he
    encouraged independent union activities and became popular among oil and
    textile industry workers (Confidential Biographic Data on Bakhtiar
    prepared by US State Department Economic Officer dated November 10, 1952).
    His efforts drew hostility from both the pro-Soviet Tudeh Party
    (influential among the oil industry workers) and the British Anglo-
    Iranian Oil Company, which ultimately led to his removal from Khuzestan.
    He was then personal advisor to the Under Secretary of Labor and served as
    the Deputy Minister of Labor during Mohammad Mosaddeq s premiership,
    1951-1953. Thanks to his expertise on labor issues, Bakhtiar played a
    leading role in the approval of Workers Social Security Law and the
    creation of the Workers' Social Security Organization in 1952. Bakhtiar
    considered himself a social democrat and had a strong commitment to
    secular democracy, which he believed was possible if Iran s constitution
    was respected and the King accepted the role of a constitutional monarch.
    His PhD thesis was on the relationship between church and state in
    antiquity. In 1949 he joined the social-democratic Iran Party, where he
    led the youth organization in the 1960s before being elected as the Party
    s leader. The Iran Party was the strongest constituent of the pro-Mossadeq
    National Front coalition, which he worked to revive after it was banned in
    1953. Following the overthrow of Mossadeq in 1953, Bakhtiar was arrested
    multiple times and spent close to six years in jail for his peaceful
    dissent and activities to revive the Natio
