circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Azizollah Gargij was reported in the newspaper
    Etela'at on February 28, 1991. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. A 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts (5 kg of hashish or
    opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone) of
    proscribed narcotics has been used to sentence thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers to death, following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against defendants cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial The defendant
    was tried by the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Zahedan. No further
    information is available about this trial. Charges Mr. Gargij was charged
    with "buying and selling 180 grams of heroin and 390 grams of opium sap."
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Gargij's defense. Judgment Mr. Gargij
    was found guilty of drug trafficking and sentenced to death. He was hanged
    in prison.
