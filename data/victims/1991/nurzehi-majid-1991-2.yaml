circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Majid Nurzehi was reported in the newspaper Etela'at
    on February 28, 1991. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities
    have brought trumped-up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. A
    1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in
    possession of specified amounts (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than
    30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone) of proscribed narcotics has been
    used to sentence thousands of alleged drug traffickers to death, following
    judicial processes that fail to meet international standards. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against defendants cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial The defendant was tried by the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Zahedan. No further information is available about this trial.
    Charges Mr. Nurzehi was charged with "buying and selling 500 grams of
    heroin." Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Nurzehi's defense. Judgment Mr. Nurzehi
    was found guilty of drug trafficking and sentenced to death. He was hanged
    in prison.
