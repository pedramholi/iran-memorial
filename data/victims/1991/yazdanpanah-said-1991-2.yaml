    Mr. Yazdanpanah s friends remember him as a person whose character
    attracted the attention of the people around him. He was a kind human
    being; he had an extensive network of people, and he had the ability of
    solving social problems and issues in spite of his youth. Information
    regarding the killing of Mr. Sa eed Yazdanpanah, son of Amineh Kake
    Mohammad Feizollah Beigi, was obtained from the Part Azadi Kurdistan
    website. Additional information was obtained from Rudaw website (2013-14)
    Part Azadiye Kurdistan ( Kurdistan Freedom Party ), PAK Declaration
    (Azadiye Bayan ( Freedom of Speech ) website s Second Archives, September
    22, 2011), the Party By-Laws, Part Azadi Kurdistan s Representative
    Mission in Europe website (September 18, 2012), and the government weblog
    Diyar va Nadiar (October 10,2015). Mr. Yazdanpanah was born on September
    18, 1964, in Bucan County s village of Saqqezlu in West Azarbaijan
    Province. He went to school in that same county, where he obtained his
    high school diploma. In high school, Mr. Yazdanpanah joined the Fadiyan
    Khalq Guerilla Organization. At the time of the issuance of Khomeini
    Decree* in August 1979, ordering the attack on Kurdistan, he and his
    brother Rashid Yazdanpanah (known as Semko , subsequently killed during
    the Kurdistan war) established a guerilla group called Semko within the
    framework of the Fadaiyan Khalq Guerilla Organization, through which they
    began fighting the central government. Mr. Yazdanpanah was Deputy First
    Person in Charge and was the person in charge of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Guerilla Organization s Kurdistan Committee for six months. He was a
    proponent of Kurdish nationalist thinking within the intra-organization
    disagreements, and believed that nationwide organizations would not help
    to unify the Kurdish nation and Kurdish independence . (Azadiye Bayan
    website s Second Archives, September 22, 2011). Mr. Yazdanpanah left the
    Organization in the years after the Revolution and continued his
    activities within the framework of the Fedaiyan Guerillas Followers of
    Identity . (Rudaw TV website, 2013-14). Ultimately, in 2012-13, Mr.
    Yazdanpanah established a Kurdish organization named Union of the
    Kurdistan People s Revolutionaries in order to bring together and join
    Kurdistan s divided [territories and establish an independent country .
    This Organization changed its name to Part Azadiye Kurdistan in its First
    Congress. (Azadiye Bayan website s Second Archives, September 22, 2011).
    Part Azadiye Kurdistan introduced him as a knowledgeable fighter with
    great leadership and organizational abilities . (Azadiye Bayan website s
    Second Archives, September 22, 2011). Mr. Yazdanpanah s friends remember
    him as a person whose character attracted the attention of the people
    around him. He was a kind human being; he had an extensive network of
    people, and he had the ability of solving social problems and issues in
    spite of his youth. (Ali Ahmadi, Sa eed Yazdanpanah Special Edition,
    Hayat-e Azadiye Kurdistan Party Party, PAK, undated). Another one of Mr.
    Yazdanpanah s friends described him as a caring and loyal friend, a
    disciplined human being from both a personal and an organizational
    standpoint, who, at the same time, was very sociable and a lover of
    literature and Kurdish music . (Sa eed Yazdanpanah Special Edition,
    Hayat-e Azadiye Kurdistan Party Party, PAK, undated). Threats Made Against
    Mr. Yazdanpanah, and His Death According to available information, Mr.
    Yazdanpanah was killed on September 19, 1991, in [the town of] Suleimanieh
    s Zargateh neighborhood, located in Iraqi Kurdistan. According to his
    brother, Hossein Yazdanpanah, he left a friend s home at approximately 7
    PM and was driving in a car toward the end of the alleyway when he was
    shot by an attacker or attackers. (Hossein Yazdanpanah, Rudaw TV website,
    2013-14). Hamnu Naqshbandi, a current member of the Part Azadiye Kurdistan
    s leadership who was an 11-year-old child at the time, recounts his memory
    of his family hosting Mr. Yazdanpanah on the day of the incident: Sa eed
    was shot a few minutes after he left our home. We had gone to a store in
    our neighborhood with several other children to do some shopping when they
    said they were closed and that the storeowner s son had left in a wagon.
    We had just arrived near a street vendor s stand when someone came over
    and said that the situation was pretty chaotic. He said that a
    motorcyclist had just shot at a red [Toyota] Land Cruiser. We could see
    from afar that Kak Sa eed s head had fallen against the steering wheel.
    (Hossein Yazdanpanah, Rudaw TV website, 2013-14). According to Hossein
    Yazdanpanah, the attackers were three terrorists with a motorcycle. They
    were somehow able to stop his car, and, unfortunately, put an end to that
    young fighter and Kurdish man of knowledge s life with two bullets .
    (Hossein Yazdanpanah, Rudaw TV website, 2013-14). Mr. Yazdanpanah was 27
    years old at the time of his death. He was buried in Iraqi Kurdistan.
