# --- LIFE ---
occupation: "Islamic scholar"
beliefs: "translator of The Canon of Medicine by Avicenna and the controversial novel, Satanic Verses"
quotes:
  - "Igarashi also defended the novel and novelist by locating the writer in the lineage of the Islamic mystical Sufi thought. According to Igarashi, Rushdie was not anti-Islamic, but his passage to England, just like Passage to India by E. M. Foster, represented a literature of exile and could be judiciously compared to the Hejra by Muhammad, to begin with, or to the 'Western Exile' in Kairouan by Suhrawardi. By interpreting the Verses as a modern version of Rumi's 'Song of a Reed,' lamenting the separation from (the) God/Creator, Igarashi identified Rushdie among the mystical and heretic poets of Islamic rage against religious profanation. Igarashi, as a Japanese man, wished to make an intervention as a third party through his Japanese translation, so as to put an end to this endless conflict."

circumstances: >
    Mr. Hitoshi Igarashi is one of hundreds of individuals who have been
    extrajudicially executed outside of Iran since the 1979 revolution. In
    many cases, these killings were carried out by agents of the Islamic
    Republic or can reasonably be assumed to be the result of Iranian
    government policy. Information about Mr. Hitoshi Igarashi's case was drawn
    from the Iranian newspaper Jomhuri Eslami (March 4, 16, and July 17,
    1991), the New York Times (July 13, 1991), a talk by Professor Shigemi
    Inaga at the International Conference on the Dialogue of Civilizations at
    the United Nations University (July 31-August 3, 2001), and Amnesty
    International report (May 1, 1997) . Mr. Igarashi, a respected Islamic
    scholar in Japan, was the translator of The Canon of Medicine by Avicenna
    (Ibn Sina) and the controversial novel, Satanic Verses , by Salman
    Rushdie. This novel was the object of a 1989 fatwa (religious edict) by
    the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in which
    he had condemned to death the author of the Satanic Verses and those
    involved in its publication and dissemination. Mr. Igarashi's murder was
    linked to his translation of Rushdie s novel. After the demise of
    Ayatollah Khomeini, his successors reconfirmed the fatwa. On February 15,
    1991, Ayatollah Sane'i, the head of a state sponsored foundation called
    Bonyad-e Panzdah-e Khordad (created by the Iranian Government on June 15,
    1979) appeared on Iranian TV and offered $3 million to any Iranian and a
    $1 million to any foreigner who killed Rushdie; he raised the prize money
    to $2 million on March 4, 1991. On March 15, 1991, the same foundation
    announced that in order to implement Khomeini's death fatwa, it would
    compensate, support, and protect those who volunteer to kill individuals
    involved in the publication and dissemination of the Satanic Verses (
    Jomhuri Eslami , March 16, 1991). Mr. Igarashi is not the sole victim of
    the fatwa; the Islamic Republic s authorities targeted other individuals
    involved in the translation or publication of the Satanic Verses . On July
    3, 1991, the Italian translator of the novel, Ettore Caprioli, was
    attacked in Milan and stabbed; he survived the assassination attempt. The
    Italian police investigating Mr. Caprioli's case announced that the
    assailant had connections with the Islamic Republic's Embassy. On October
    11, 1993, William Nygaard, Salman Rushdie's Norwegian publisher, became
    the victim of an assassination attempt and survived against heavy odds.
    The Norwegian government reacted to this attack by recalling its
    ambassador to Iran. Arrest and detention Mr. Hitoshi Igarashi was never
    arrested. Trial Mr. Igarashi was not summoned before a court, and no
    public trial was held in his case. It is not known whether he was tried in
    abstentia in Iran. Charges No specific charges were brought against Mr.
    Igarashi. However in his 1989 fatwa, Ayatollah Khomeini charged all the
    people involved in the publication and dissemination of the Satanic Verses
    with "insulting the sacred beliefs of Muslims." Evidence of guilt The
    Japanese version of the Satanic Verses . Defense Mr. Igarashi was not
    given the opportunity to defend himself before being killed. However,
    since there was an international debate on the fatwa, he had explained his
    decision to translate the Satanic Verses . According to Shigemi Inaga
    (August 1-2, 2001, Kyoto): ".... Igarashi also defended the novel and
    novelist by locating the writer in the lineage of the Islamic mystical
    Sufi thought. According to Igarashi, Rushdie was not anti-Islamic, but his
    passage to England, just like Passage to India by E. M. Foster,
    represented a literature of exile and could be judiciously compared to the
    Hejra by Muhammad, to begin with, or to the "Western Exile" in Kairouan by
    Suhrawardi. By interpreting the Verses as a modern version of Rumi's "Song
    of a Reed," lamenting the separation from (the) God/Creator, Igarashi
    identified Rushdie among the mystical and heretic poets of Islamic rage
    against religious profanation. Igarashi, as a Japanese man, wished to make
    an intervention as a third party through his Japanese translation, so as
    to put an end to this endless conflict." Judgment On February 14, 1989,
    the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a
    death fatwa against the author, the editors and publishers of the Satanic
    Verses in the following terms: "We are from God and to God we shall
    return" (Koranic verse). I am informing all brave Muslims of the world
    that the author of the Satanic Verses , a text written, edited, and
    published against Islam, the Prophet of Islam, and the Koran, along with
    all the editors and publishers aware of its contents, are condemned to
    death. I call on all valiant Muslims wherever they may be in the world to
    kill them without delay, so that no one will dare insult the sacred
    beliefs of Muslims henceforth. And whoever is killed in this cause will be
    a martyr, God Willing..." (Ruhollah al-Musavi al-Khomeini). On Ma
