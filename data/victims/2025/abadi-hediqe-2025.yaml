    Several months after their parents arrest by Iranian officials, Hediqe
    Abadi s children were sent back to Afghanistan. Information regarding the
    execution of Ms. Hediqe Abadi was gathered from reports published by the
    Iran Human Rights Organization (September 13, 2025). Ms. Abadi was a
    46-year-old Afghan woman from Herat, who reportedly spent around 20 years
    living in Iran. She worked as a janitor in Taleqan and Karaj. She was
    married and had three young children (Iran Human Rights Organization,
    September 13, 2025). Ms. Abadi s case is related to drug offenses. Arrest
    and detention Ms. Abadi was arrested together with her husband, Mr. Yunes
    Mazarshams, and their three children. Several months after their arrest,
    Iranian authorities sent their children back to Afghanistan (Iran Human
    Rights Organization, September 13, 2025). The circumstances of Ms. Hediqe
    Abadi s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on Ms. Abadi. s trial. Charges The charges brought against Ms.
    Hediqe Abadi were announced as engaging in drug-related offenses." The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up
    charges, including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences,
    against their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as
    well as unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were
    executed based on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug
    traffickers found in possession of specified amounts of prescribed
    narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin,
    codeine or methadone). The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against Ms. Hediqe Abadi. Defense No information is available on Ms.
    Hediqe Abadi s defense. Judgment According to reports, Ms. Abadi was
    sentenced to death by a court. On September 11, 2025, her death sentence,
    along with her husband's, was carried out at Qazvin Central Prison (Chubin
    Dar). As of this writing, Iranian domestic media and official sources had
    not officially announced the executions of these two prisoners (Iran Human
    Rights Organization, September 13, 2025).
