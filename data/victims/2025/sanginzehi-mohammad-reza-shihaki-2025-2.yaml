circumstances: >
    Mr. Mohammad Reza Shihaki was 16 years old when he was arrested for murder
    and was subsequently sentenced to death. Information regarding the
    execution of Mr. Mohammad Reza Shihaki was obtained from the Halvash
    website and the Instagram page of the Baloch Activists Campaign (October
    2, 2025). Mr. Shihaki, son of Khan Mohammad, was 25 years old and resided
    in the village of Masjed Abolfazl," within Bazman District of Iranshahr
    County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province. According to available
    information, Mr. Shihaki s case dates back to when he was just 16 years
    old and involved the killing of a person during a family dispute. (Baloch
    Activists Campaign; Halvash, October 2, 2025). International laws have
    strictly prohibited capital punishment for those who were under the age of
    18 at the time of committing a crime. As a party to the International
    Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of
    the Child, Iran has the obligation not to impose capital punishment for an
    offense committed before the age of eighteen. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Shihaki was arrested in 2016. However, the circumstances of his arrest and
    detention are not known. (Baloch Activists Campaign; Halvash, October 2,
    2025). Trial A Criminal Court tried Mr. Shihaki; however, no details are
    available on Mr. Shihaki s trial. (Baloch Activists Campaign; Halvash,
    October 2, 2025). Charges The charge against Mr. Mohammad Reza Shihaki was
    announced as murder . (Baloch Activists Campaign; Halvash, October 2,
    2025). In 2016, Mr. Shihaki was involved in a family dispute that led to a
    fatal altercation, resulting in a person's death. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offenses, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Mohammad Reza Shihaki. Defense No information is available regarding Mr.
    Shihaki s defense. It is only known that he was 16 years old and a minor
    at the time of the alleged offense. Judgment The Criminal Court sentenced
    Mohammad Reza Shihaki to death for murder. He was executed in Iranshahr
    Prison in the early morning hours of Thursday, October 2, 2025 (Baloch
    Activists Campaign; Halvash, October 2, 2025). According to Halvash, the
    plaintiff s family were close relatives of Mr. Shihaki, and despite
    efforts by his family, they refused to give consent (Baloch Activists
    Campaign, October 2, 2025).
