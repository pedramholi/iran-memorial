    Born in 2004, shot in the head by a plainclothes security agent while
  participating in peaceful protest. The group of protesters had spent hours
  peacefully demonstrating and chanting against the government. The crowd moved
  towards Imam Square, where a statue of Ruhollah Khomeini is located. Stones
  were thrown at the statue. Basij, police officers and plainclothes security
  officers started firing their weapons. According to IranWire, locals alleged
  that Ebrahim Aharoun, a retired IRGC member in plainclothes during the
  protest, was the person who shot Khodayarifard. After the shooting,
  Khodayarifard was transferred to medical facilities in Khorramabad, where he
  died several hours later. Government officials falsely claimed he was a Basij
  member and pressured his family to state this, but the family refused.
