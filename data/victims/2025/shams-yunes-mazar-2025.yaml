    Several months after their parents arrest by Iranian officials, Yunes
    Mazarshams s children were sent back to Afghanistan. Information regarding
    the execution of Mr. Yunes Mazarshams was gathered from reports published
    by the Iran Human Rights Organization (September 13, 2025). Mr. Yunes
    Mazarshams was a 46-year-old Afghan man from Herat, who reportedly spent
    around 20 years living in Iran. He worked as a janitor in Taleqan and
    Karaj. He was married and had three young children (Iran Human Rights
    Organization, September 13, 2025). Mr. Yunes Mazarshams s case is related
    to drug offenses. Arrest and detention Mr. Mazarshams was arrested
    together with his wife, Ms. Hediqe Abadi, and their three children.
    Several months after their arrest, Iranian authorities sent their children
    back to Afghanistan (Iran Human Rights Organization, September 13, 2025).
    The circumstances of Mr. Mazarshams s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on Mr. Mazarshams s trial. Charges The
    charges brought against Mr. Mazarshams were announced as engaging in
    drug-related offenses. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. Scores of them were executed based on a 1989 law
    imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found in possession
    of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of hashish or opium,
    and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone). The exact number
    of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of
    guilt The report of this execution does not contain information regarding
    the evidence provided against Mr. Yunes Mazarshams. Defense No information
    is available on Mr. Mazarshams s defense. Judgment According to reports,
    Mr. Yunes Mazarshams was sentenced to death by a court. On September 11,
    2025, his death sentence, along with his wife's, was carried out at Qazvin
    Central Prison (Chubin Dar). As of this writing, Iranian domestic media
    and official sources had not officially announced the executions of these
    two prisoners (Iran Human Rights Organization, September 13, 2025).
