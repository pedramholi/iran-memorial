circumstances: >
  Hosseini was arrested on November 4, 2022, the day after protests near
  Behesht-e Sakineh Cemetery in Karaj during the 40th-day memorial of Hadis
  Najafi. He maintained he was not at the protests and was on his way to visit
  his parents' graves at the same cemetery. His lawyer stated the confession was
  extracted under severe torture: authorities blindfolded him, bound his hands
  and feet, kicked him in the head until he fainted, struck the soles of his feet
  with an iron rod, and electrically shocked him. Swords and knives found in his
  home were his martial arts equipment. He was sentenced to death on December 5,
  2022, on charges of efsad-e fel-arz ("corruption on Earth") and moharebeh.
  He was executed alongside Mohammad Mehdi Karami on January 7, 2023.
