    One of the relatives of Mr. Aji described him as a very calm man,
    guileless, smart, active, and capable . According to this source, he was
    well read, he participated in sports, and he was interested in soccer.
    Information regarding the case of Mr. Loqman Aji (also known as Loqman
    Garguli), son of Amir and Shilan Aji, was obtained from an interview
    conducted by Boroumand Center with one of his relatives (June 17, 2023.
    Additional information was collected from Iran Newspaper website (July 8,
    2023, Issue number 8226), Kurdistan Human Rights Network (July 7, 2023),
    Hengaw Human Rights Organization (July 7 10, 2023), Kurdistan Media,
    Central website of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan of Iran (July 7,
    2023), Kurdpa (July 10, 2023), and Iran International (July 7, 2023). Mr.
    Aji was born on June 15, 1998, in the village of Gargul-e Sofla, near
    Naqadeh in Western Azerbaijan. When he was 6 years old, his family moved
    to Naqadeh. He went to school in Naqadeh. When he was in the first year of
    high school, due to economic hardship, he was obliged to drop out of
    school and work in the aluminum door and window making industry. After
    dropping out of school, Mr. Aji worked in aluminum door and window
    production for two years (Center Interview with a relative, June 17,
    2023). According to one of his relatives, Mr. Aji contacted the Democratic
    Party of Kurdistan of Iran (HADKA) in 2015, whereupon he left Iran and
    joined the camps of this party in Iraqi Kurdistan. He returned to Iran a
    month later. He was detained for 20 days, for having left the country
    illegally and for his activities with anti-government parties. He was
    released on bail. Even so, Mr. Aji kept his organizational contact with
    the Democratic Party. In 2016, he left the country again, and this time he
    formally joined this party as a Peshmerga* . This time he completed the
    basic training course and went to the camps in border regions. He served 4
    years in the Service Organization and Unit 122 for organizing. At that
    time he was a member of the Party and he progressed to the point where he
    was the designated alternative to the head of the command unit (Center
    Interview with a relative, June 17, 2023). According to one of his
    relatives, Mr. Aji was a well-known figure among the Members of the HADKA
    organization in Piranshahr area (Center Interview with a relative, June
    17, 2023). In Mr. Aji s family, who are Kurdish and Sunni, political
    activity is not unprecedented. His grandfather was arrested and spent more
    than three years in prison for political activity in support of the
    Democratic Party of Kurdistan of Iran. This episode affected other family
    members including Mr. Loqman Aji and got them involved in politics (Center
    Interview with a relative, June 17, 2023). Mr. Aji was a full member of
    the Democratic Party of Kurdistan of Iran. Mr. Aji was single. One of his
    relatives describes him as a very calm man, guileless, smart, active, and
    capable. According to this source, he was well read, he participated in
    sports, and he was interested in soccer (Center Interview with a relative,
    June 17, 2023). The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) The
    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) was founded in 1945 with the
    goal to gain autonomy for Kurdistan, in north-western Iran. After the
    Revolution, conflicts between the new central Shiite government and mainly
    Sunni Kurdistan regarding the role of minorities in the drafting of the
    constitution, specification of Shiite as the official state religion, and
    particularly the autonomy of the region, ended in armed clashes between
    the Revolutionary Guards and the peshmerga (the militia of the PDKI). The
    PDKI boycotted the referendum of April 1, 1979, when people went to polls
    to vote for or against the Islamic regime. On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah
    Khomeini called the PDKI the party of Satan and declared it unofficial and
    illegal. Mass executions and fighting broke out and continued for several
    months in the region. By 1983, the PDKI had lost much of its influence in
    the region. In the years since various leaders of the PDKI have been
    assassinated. Following internal disputes, the party split in 2006 and two
    organizations were established as The Democratic Party of Iranian
    Kurdistan, and The Democratic Party of Kurdistan. The Kurdish Problem in
    the Islamic Republic After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the disagreements
    between the government of the Shiite Islamic Republic and the
    organizations in the Kurdish regions of western Iran regarding the rights
    and roles of minorities in drafting the Constitution; whether the
    government should be secular or religious, and especially the issue of
    Kurdish autonomy; and conflicts that resulted in Kurdish political
    organizations boycotting the April 1979 Referendum on instituting an
    Islamic Republic; led to serious, and at times armed, clashes between the
    central government and the Peshmerga (Kurdistan Democratic Party s armed
    forces). On August 19, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini lab
