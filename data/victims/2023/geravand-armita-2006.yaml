circumstances: >
  On October 1, 2023, Geravand was boarding a subway train at Shohada station on
  her way to school. Human rights activists say female morality police officers
  confronted her about her hijab, resulting in a physical altercation that caused
  her to collapse and sustain severe head trauma. Iranian authorities claim she
  fainted from low blood pressure. CCTV footage released by authorities was
  heavily edited and inconclusive. She was taken to Fajr Army Hospital where she
  was kept in ICU. Declared brain dead October 22. Died October 28. Burial
  conducted under heavy security presence. Her case drew comparisons to Mahsa
  Amini exactly one year earlier.
