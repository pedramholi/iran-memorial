    "The confessions I made were all under torture. They tortured me a lot
    there. They forced me. They dislocated my shoulder. They broke it."
    Information regarding the execution of Sa'id Ya'qubi Kordsofla, son of
    Karam Ali, along with two other individuals, was gathered from the
    websites of the Mizan News Agency (May 19, 2023) and HRANA the news agency
    of the Human Rights Activists in Iran (May 19, 2023). Additional
    information was gathered from the verdict issued by Branch 9 of the
    Supreme Court (May 1, 2023); the websites of the Mizan News Agency (May
    17, 2023); IranWire (January 16 and May 19, 2023); IRNA the Islamic
    Republic News Agency (January 9 and 17, 2023); HRANA (January 9 and 15,
    May 10, 14, and 22, 2023, and May 22, 2023); Dadban the Legal Consultation
    and Education Center for Civil Society Activists (May 9, 2023); Shargh
    Network interview with Somayeh Kazemi (May 15, 2023); ISNA the Iranian
    Students News Agency (May 21, 2023); courtroom footage; broadcast of the
    coerced confessions of the three defendants (May 10, 2023); Iran
    International (May 19 and June 7, 2023); YouTube video of Mr. Ya'qubi s
    mother (May 1, 2023); and a Radio Zamaneh interview with Mohammad Hashemi,
    the cousin of Mr. Kazemi (May 13, 2023). According to available
    information, Mr. Sa'id Ya'qubi Kordsofla was unmarried and a native and
    resident of Isfahan. He worked at a real estate agency and cared for his
    81-year-old mother and 84-year-old father. Mr. Ya'qubi had no criminal
    record. Mr. Ya'qubi s case, commonly referred to as the Khaneh-ye Isfahan
    case, was a group case involving six defendants. Ten individuals were
    initially arrested in connection with the case, and ultimately,
    indictments were issued against six of them. Mr. Ya'qubi and the others
    were accused of murder, moharebeh ("enmity against God"), and corruption
    on earth. Mr. Ya'qubi and the other defendants participated in the
    November 16, 2022, protests in Negahbani Square in the Khaneh-ye Isfahan
    neighborhood. These protests were part of the nationwide demonstrations
    that erupted in the fall of 2022 following the death of Mahsa Amini in the
    custody of the Morality Police, who had arrested her for alleged "improper
    hijab." This case became one of the most high-profile judicial cases
    linked to the 2022 nationwide protests and drew widespread criticism from
    both domestic and international observers. 2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest
    background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in custody of
    22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16, 2022. Amini
    had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for improper veiling on
    September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The news of her death
    triggered protests, which started with a widespread expression of outrage
    on social media and the gathering of a large crowd in front of the
    hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa
    was buried. Popular exasperation over the morality patrols and the veil in
    general, aggravated by misleading statements of the authorities regarding
    the cause of Mahsa s death and the impunity generally granted to state
    agents for the violence used against detainees led to months of nationwide
    protests. Initially led by young girls and women who burned their veils,
    and youth in general, protesters adopted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom,
    chanted during Amini s burial. The protest rapidly took on a clear
    anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an end to the Islamic
    Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was unprecedented. State
    efforts to withdraw the morality police from the streets and preventative
    arrests of journalists and political and civil society activists did not
    stop the protests. By the end of December 2022, protests had taken place
    in about 164 cities and towns, including localities that had never
    witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities, high schools, businesses,
    and groups including oil workers, merchants of the Tehran bazaar (among
    others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom had been arrested as of
    February 1st, 2023), artists, athletes, and even doctors joined these
    protests in various forms. Despite the violent crackdown and mass arrests,
    intense protests continued for weeks, at least through November 2022, with
    reports of sporadic activity continuing through the beginning of 2023. The
    State s crackdown was swift and accompanied by intermittent landline and
    cellular internet network shutdowns, as well as threats against and
    arrests of victims family members, factors which posed a serious challenge
    to monitoring protests and documenting casualties. The security forces
    used illegal, excessive, and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and
    military assault rifles against protesters. They often targeted protesters
    heads and chests, shot them at close range, and in the back. Security
    forces have targeted faces with pellets, causing hundreds of protesters to
    lose their eyesight, and according to some reports women s
