    News of Mr. Khaleq Khezradeh s execution was published on the websites of
    Kurdistan Human Rights Network and Hengaw (January 9, 2023). Additional
    information about this case was obtained from decisions of Branch 2 of the
    Hormozgan Province Appeals Court (November 17, 2020) and Branch 50 of the
    Supreme Court (January 6, 2021; both on file with the Abdorrahman
    Boroumand Center, ABC), as well as an interview conducted by ABC with
    sources with knowledge of the case (January 13, 2023 and May 15, 2023).
    Mr. Khezrzadeh, son of Omar, was an ethnically Kurdish native of the
    village of Kani Bodagh in the Lajan district of Piranshahr County, West
    Azerbaijan province and 32 years old at the time of his execution (Appeals
    Court decision, Kurdistan Human Rights Network, Hengaw, ABC interview May
    15, 2023). He was married and the father of a single son. He enjoyed
    hiking, fishing, and wrestling, and attended anti-government protests (ABC
    interview January 13, 2023). Around the year 2008, Mr. Khezrzadeh s
    family, faced with poor economic circumstances, moved to the city of
    Piranshahr from the countryside. Mr. Khezrzadeh completed his second year
    of high school and after completing his mandatory military service entered
    the labor market to help make ends meet for his family. He worked as a
    border courier, as well as in the fields of building construction and
    truck driving (ABC interview, May 15, 2023). The case against Mr.
    Khezrzadeh was based on the recovery of illicit drugs from a vehicle he
    was driving near Bandar Lengeh, Hormozgan Province in June of 2021. Arrest
    and Detention Mr. Khezrzadeh and a co-defendant were arrested on June 1,
    2020, when the vehicle Mr. Khezrzadaeh was driving was stopped by
    uniformed police in Berkeh-ye Soflin village of Bandar Lengeh, Hormozgan
    Province. Agents recovered the drugs from the vehicle. After two days in
    custody, Mr. Khezrazadeh was able to inform his family of his arrest by
    phone (Supreme Court decision, ABC interview). Following initial
    interrogations, Mr. Khezrzadeh and his co-defendant were held on a
    temporary detention order issued October 10, 2022 by Branch One of the
    Bandar Lengeh County Revolutionary Court. They contested this order, which
    was upheld by Branch Two of the Hormozgan Province Appeals Court (under
    Presiding Judge Mashallah Afsharpur and Member Judge Mokhtar Sadeqi). From
    Bandar Lengeh, Mr. Khezrzadeh was transferred to Bandar Abbas Central
    Prison (Supreme Court decision, ABC interview January 13, 2023). Mr.
    Khezrzadeh s family was not able to visit him during his time in custody,
    owing to their poverty (ABC interview May 15, 2023). Trial Khezrzadeh was
    originally tried at Branch One of the Revolutionary Court of Bandar Lengeh
    County, by way of a virtual video connection established with Bandar
    Lengeh prison on October 20, 2020. He was represented by a court-appointed
    attorney (Supreme Court decision). Charges The charge against Mr.
    Khezradeh were corruption on earth through drug trafficking by way of
    conspiracy in the transportation of 6.2 kilograms of crystal
    methamphetamine (Supreme Court decision). The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against their
    opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Thousands of alleged drug
    traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. Scores of them were executed based
    on a 1989 law imposing mandatory death sentences on drug traffickers found
    in possession of specified amounts of prescribed narcotics (5 kg of
    hashish or opium, and more than 30 grams of heroin, codeine or methadone).
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of Guilt The charges against Mr. Khezrzadeh were based
    on the discovery of 6.2 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine in a vehicle
    he was driving.The evidence against him comprised his own confession of
    having done something illegal as well as the confessions of his
    co-defendants and the notes of the arresting officers (Supreme Court
    decision, ABC interview January 13, 2023.) International human rights
    organizations have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic
    Republic of Iran for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary
    confinement to obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the
    authenticity of confessions obtained under duress. Defense Based on court
    document information, in initial interrogations, Mr. Khezrzadeh confessed
    to transporting the narcotics recovered from the car, after his
    codefendant s friend had taken the vehicle for a period of two days. After
    being read his ch
