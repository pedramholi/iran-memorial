    "I was at work until 8:30 p.m. What group was I supposedly affiliated
    with?" I m a small business owner. I have no criminal record and am not
    affiliated with any group, party, or organization. They can ask around the
    neighborhood. My workshop is there, and there are cameras. Information
    regarding the execution of Majid Kazemi Sheikh Shabani, son of Mohammad
    Reza, along with two other individuals, was gathered from the websites of
    the Mizan News Agency (May 19, 2023) and HRANA the news agency of the
    Human Rights Activists in Iran (May 19, 2023). Additional information was
    gathered from the verdict issued by Branch 9 of the Supreme Court (May 1,
    2023); the websites of the Mizan News Agency (May 17, 2023); IRNA the
    Islamic Republic News Agency (January 9 and 17, 2023); HRANA (January 9
    and 15, May 9, 14, and 22, 2023); Dadban the Legal Consultation and
    Education Center for Civil Society Activists (May 9, 2023); Shargh Network
    interview with Somayeh Kazemi (May 15, 2023); IranWire (January 16 and May
    19, 2023); ISNA (May 21, 2023); courtroom footage; broadcast of the
    coerced confessions of the three defendants (May 10, 2023); and a Radio
    Zamaneh interview with Mr. Kazemi s cousin, Mohammad Hashemi (May 13,
    2023); and audio messages sent by Mr. Kazemi to his family (January 13,
    2023). According to available information, Majid Kazemi was born in 1992
    and lived in Isfahan. He owned a copperware workshop in the city where he
    employed eight people. Those close to him described him as a cheerful,
    energetic, friendly, and kindhearted person. He enjoyed football and
    wrestling. Speaking about him, Mr. Kazemi s cousin, Mohammad Hashemi,
    said: "He was one of those people who always had a smile on their face
    someone whose presence would instantly lift your spirits" (Radio Zamaneh
    interview) Mr. Kazemi s case, commonly referred to as the Khaneh-ye
    Isfahan case, was a group case involving six defendants. Ten individuals
    were initially arrested in connection with the case, and ultimately,
    indictments were issued against six of them. Mr. Kazemi and the others
    were accused of murder, moharebeh ("enmity against God"), and corruption
    on earth. Mr. Kazemi and the other defendants participated in the November
    16, 2022, protests in Negahbani Square in the Khaneh-ye Isfahan
    neighborhood. These protests were part of the nationwide demonstrations
    that erupted in the fall of 2022 following the death of Mahsa Amini in the
    custody of the Morality Police, who had arrested her for alleged "improper
    hijab." This case became one of the most high-profile judicial cases
    linked to the 2022 nationwide protests and drew widespread criticism from
    both domestic and international observers. 2022 (Mahsa Amini) Protest
    background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in custody of
    22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16, 2022. Amini
    had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for improper veiling on
    September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The news of her death
    triggered protests, which started with a widespread expression of outrage
    on social media and the gathering of a large crowd in front of the
    hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan Province), where Mahsa
    was buried. Popular exasperation over the morality patrols and the veil in
    general, aggravated by misleading statements of the authorities regarding
    the cause of Mahsa s death and the impunity generally granted to state
    agents for the violence used against detainees led to months of nationwide
    protests. Initially led by young girls and women who burned their veils,
    and youth in general, protesters adopted the slogan Women, Life, Freedom,
    chanted during Amini s burial. The protest rapidly took on a clear
    anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an end to the Islamic
    Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was unprecedented. State
    efforts to withdraw the morality police from the streets and preventative
    arrests of journalists and political and civil society activists did not
    stop the protests. By the end of December 2022, protests had taken place
    in about 164 cities and towns, including localities that had never
    witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities, high schools, businesses,
    and groups including oil workers, merchants of the Tehran bazaar (among
    others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom had been arrested as of
    February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even doctors joined these
    protests in various forms. Despite the violent crackdown and mass arrests,
    intense protests continued for weeks, at least through November 2022, with
    reports of sporadic activity continuing through the beginning of 2023. The
    State s crackdown was swift and accompanied by intermittent landline and
    cellular internet network shutdowns, as well as threats against and
    arrests of victims family members, factors which posed a serious challenge
    to monitoring protests and documenting casualties. The security forces
