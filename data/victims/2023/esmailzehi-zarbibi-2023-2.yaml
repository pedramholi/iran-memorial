    Bloody Friday The city of Zahedan in Sistan and Baluchestan Province, and
    home to the ethnic and majority Sunni Baluch minority, was the scene of a
    massacre on Friday, September 30, 2022. The massacre, also known as
    Zahedan Bloody Friday, took place in the context of nationwide protests
    that followed the death in detention of Mahsa Jina Amini on September 16,
    2022 and after the news of the rape of a 15-year old girl by the Police
    Chief in Rasak, which was confirmed by the local Friday sermon cleric, had
    sparked protests in Chabahar on September 27. The earlier protest had led
    to calls for further demonstrations across the Province on Friday
    September 30th in solidarity with those who struggle across Iran s
    geography and in Kurdistan, and called for a transparent investigation of
    the rape and accountability by local clericsm including the Great Mosalla
    prayer complex, located near Zahedan s Makki mosque. Based on eyewitness
    testimonies, media, and human rights groups investigations of videos and
    photos of the event that took place on September 30, 2022, the shootings
    by armed security forces (including some in plain clothes), who were
    located on the roof of Police Station 16 across the Great Mosalla and
    surrounding roofs, began when a small group of unarmed worshipers emerged
    from the prayer complex around mid-day, before the end of the Friday
    prayer and walked toward the police station chanting anti-government
    slogans. In response, security forces fired live ammunition, metal pellets
    and tear gas at them and at bystanders while protesters threw stones at
    the police station. Snipers also shot at worshipers in the Mosalla and its
    vicinity killing scores, including children and at least one female
    worshiper. According to medical professionals, many victims died from
    bullet wounds to the head, back of the head and neck, torso, heart, and
    stomach. Following the shootings, tension mounted in several other
    neighborhoods in Zahedan and the surrounding area, including around Maki
    mosque. The authorities reported that three police stations had been
    attacked by protesters that day in Zahedan. In a statement issued on
    October 28, the Security Council of Sistan and Baluchestan province
    claimed that six security force members and 35 other people including
    worshipers and bystanders had been killed, and falsely accused protesters
    of having attacked the police station with stones and firearms.
    Additionally, the statement announced that the head of Police Station
    Number 16 and the head of police in Zahedan were dismissed because of
    their fatal negligence . As of October, the number of people killed during
    Zahedan s Bloody Friday or died from their injuries in the following days
    and weeks has been estimated between 66 and 97 and hundreds were wounded.
