    Arian was a diligent student with a passion for technical work. Born in
    Sanandaj, he balanced his studies with working in his father's carpentry
    shop and baguette bakery. After graduation, he planned to pursue a career
    in HVAC and plumbing. Information regarding the arbitrary execution of
    Mohammad Arian Khoshgovar, a 17-year-old student and son of Farshid and
    Sahar Zandi, was obtained through the Broumand Center's (ABC) interview
    with an informed person on March 24, 2023. Additional information was
    gathered from the Hengaw website (March 14, 2023), Radio Farda (September
    28, 2023), and the Instagram page of Arian's mother (January 13, 2024).
    Mohammad Arian Khoshgovar was born on May 8, 2005, in Sanandaj to a
    Kurdish family. He was the oldest child and had one younger brother. The
    family lived in the 5 Azar neighborhood of the city. Arian was a
    third-year high school student majoring in HVAC and Plumbing Systems at
    Shahriar Namaki Governmental leading high school in Sanandaj. From a young
    age, Arian had a deep interest in technical activities and physical work.
    In addition to his studies, he worked in a carpentry workshop where he
    enthusiastically and diligently honed his technical skills. Arian
    regularly went to the workshop after school to continue learning and
    improving his skills. He also helped his father in the family bakery,
    specializing in baguettes. Arian had ambitious plans for his future; he
    wanted to open his own shop after graduation and pursue a career in HVAC
    and plumbing, focusing on HVAC package and radiator installation. Arian's
    close friends and family describe him as a "quiet, intelligent and
    hardworking" person. In addition to his studies and work, Arian had a deep
    passion for swimming. "Arian was a reserved teenager who usually spoke
    little in gatherings, preferring to remain silent unless directly
    addressed. Despite this, he always showed respect for his elders and was a
    calm and disciplined person in both his family and social relationships."
    During the "Women, Life, Freedom" protests, some students at Arian's
    school chanted slogans against the government. Security forces raided the
    school several times, prompting school officials to help students escape
    over the school walls to avoid arrest. Arian managed to escape from the
    school that day with great difficulty. However, due to the heightened
    security atmosphere in the city and at the school, his family decided that
    it was safer for him not to attend school from that point on (ABC
    Interview with an Informed Person, March 24, 2023). 2022 (Mahsa Amini)
    Protest background Nationwide protests were sparked by the death in
    custody of 22-year old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini on September 16,
    2022. Amini had been arrested by the morality police in Tehran for
    improper veiling on September 13 and sent brain dead to the hospital. The
    news of her death triggered protests, which started with a widespread
    expression of outrage on social media and the gathering of a large crowd
    in front of the hospital,continued in the city of Saqqez (Kordestan
    Province), where Mahsa was buried. Popular exasperation over the morality
    patrols and the veil in general, aggravated by misleading statements of
    the authorities regarding the cause of Mahsa s death and the impunity
    generally granted to state agents for the violence used against detainees
    led to months of nationwide protests. Initially led by young girls and
    women who burned their veils, and youth in general, protesters adopted the
    slogan Women, Life, Freedom, chanted during Amini s burial. The protest
    rapidly took on a clear anti-regime tone, with protesters calling for an
    end to the Islamic Republic. The scope and duration of the protest was
    unprecedented. State efforts to withdraw the morality police from the
    streets and preventative arrests of journalists and political and civil
    society activists did not stop the protests. By the end of December 2022,
    protests had taken place in about 164 cities and towns, including
    localities that had never witnessed protests. Close to 150 universities,
    high schools, businesses, and groups including oil workers, merchants of
    the Tehran bazaar (among others), teachers, lawyers (at least 49 of whom
    had been arrested as of February 1 st , 2023), artists, athletes, and even
    doctors joined these protests in various forms. Despite the violent
    crackdown and mass arrests, intense protests continued for weeks, at least
    through November 2022, with reports of sporadic activity continuing
    through the beginning of 2023. The State s crackdown was swift and
    accompanied by intermittent landline and cellular internet network
    shutdowns, as well as threats against and arrests of victims family
    members, factors which posed a serious challenge to monitoring protests
    and documenting casualties. The security forces used illegal, excessive,
    and lethal force with handguns, shotguns, and military assault rifles
    against protesters. They often targeted protesters heads and chests, shot
    them at
