    The information about Mr. Hassan Jahangiri Lakani is based on an interview
    with a person close to him. He was born in Lahijan in 1956. He was a high
    school graduate and a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class. He was first in charge of Peykar
    sympathizers in Lahijan and then, a member of the Gilan Committee, and
    finally, in charge of connections with Tehran for the organization. This
    execution was also announced in the addendum of the Mojahed magazine, No.
    261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization on September 6, 1985.
    The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The details of this defendant’s arrest and
    detention are not known. Mr. Hassan Jahangiri Lakani was arrested at a
    disclosed appointment on June 5, 1983. He was transferred to the Evin
    prison. According to one of his cellmates, he was tortured severely for
    four months and three times he attempted to commit suicide unsuccessfully.
    The observation of this former prisoner is published in a pamphlet by the
    Independent Political Refugees Center in Gottingen, Germany. According to
    the interviewee, Mr. Hassan Jahangiri Lakani, during his two visitations
    with his mother, tried to relay a message that his wife must escape. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No
    information is available on Mr. Hassan Jahangiri Lakani’s charges. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available about his defense. Judgment Mr. Hassan
    Jahangiri Lakani was condemned to death. He was executed by a firing squad
    at Evin prison on December 2, 1983. His body is buried in the Khavaran
    cemetery under number 1648. According to the interviewee, "like all of
    those who are buried in this cemetery and their graves are destroyed by
    the agents of the Islamic Republic, he has no other name or tombstone.
    Sometimes, on the place that might be his grave, you can find some
    seashells. It’s possible that his mother or somebody else, who loved him,
    marked his grave that way."
