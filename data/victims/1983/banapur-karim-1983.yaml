    The execution of Mr. Karim Banapur was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on November 7, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Banapur was reportedly
    charged with buying and using narcotics, being convicted of drug-related
    offences 11 times, robbery and acts incompatible with chastity. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Banapur s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Hormozgan declared Mr. Banapur a corruptor on
    earth and sentenced him to death, based on the articles 141 and 143 in
    Hodud (punishment prescribed in religious law) and Qesas (law of talio).
    The sentence was carried out in front of the Hezbollah Ummah (community).
