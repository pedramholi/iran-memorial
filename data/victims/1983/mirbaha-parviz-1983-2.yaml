    The information about Mr. Parviz Mirbaha is taken from the book Our
    Martyrs in the Path to Freedom by Rah-e Kargar publications, copyright
    1988. He was born in Zanjan and graduated with a mechanical engineering
    degree from the Polytechnic University of Tehran. In 1973, during his
    student years, he was active in a group which opposed the previous regime.
    After the Revolution, he joined the Revolutionary Workers Organization of
    Iran-Rah-e Kargar and was an activist among the workers. "Rah-e Kargar" or
    the "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the
    summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various
    leftist groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in
    political action. They identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists,
    promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat.
    They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they
    opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest

    never chose to give the executioners information about my comrades thereby
    depriving a family of a loved one.” Trial No information is available on
