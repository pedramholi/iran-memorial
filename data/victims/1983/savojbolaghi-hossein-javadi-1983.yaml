    The execution of Mr. Hossein Javadi Savojbolaghi, along with sixteen
    others, was announced by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran and reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on

    available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Javadi Savojbolaghi was
    reportedly charged with being consistently involved in the production and
    distribution of heroin, confessing to dealing heroin 16 times-150 gm each
    time, possessing 55 gm of heroin and having a criminal record. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Javadi Savojbolaghi's defense. Judgment The
    Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran
    sentenced Mr. Javadi Savojbolaghi to death. The sentence was carried out
    in Qasr Prison.
