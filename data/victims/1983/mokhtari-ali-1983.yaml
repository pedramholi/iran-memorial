    The execution of Mr. Ali Mokhtari, along with sixteen others, was
    announced in a communiqu from the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami Daily on October 8, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Mokhtari was reportedly
    charged with purchasing and distributing narcotics, establishing a
    trafficking gang, confessing to dealing 1.400 kg of heroin, possessing 17
    gm and 15 centigram of heroin when arrested, and having been convicted
    previously several times. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Mokhtari's defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal in Tehran declared Mr. Mokhtari a corruptor on earth and
    sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the
    sentence was carried out at 5 a.m. Based on the available information, the
    following human rights have been violated in this case: The right to
    liberty and security of the person. The right not to be subjected to
