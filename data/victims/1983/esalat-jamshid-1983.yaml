    Information about Mr. Jamshid Esalat has been drawn from an electronic
    form sent to Omid by an individual familiar with this case. His name is
    also mentioned in the book Parandeh-ye Noparvaz [The Bird that Had Just
    Learned How to Fly] (published by the Communist Party of Iran in summer of
    2004), as well as in the addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were
    executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Esalat
    was born in Amol (Mazandaran province) in 1941. He was married and had
    four children. He worked as a seconday school teacher. He was a member of
    the Ettehadieh Komonist-ha. The Ettehadieh Komonist-ha was created by
    exiled opponents of the Pahlavi regime who mostly belonged to the Student
    Confederation. They followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung and did not
    believe in guerilla warfare. The group became marked by ideological
    divides during the periods preceding and following the 1979 revolution
    which caused it to split into several factions. One of the most important
    rifts was triggered by the decision by a number of members to take up arms
    and take over a city in Iran. The uprising plan, devised in the midst of
    an active and violent anti-communist campaign by the revolutionary Islamic
    government, split the Ettehadieh in two factions: one believing in the
    armed movement and the other opposing it. In the winter of 1982, armed
    members of the Ettehadieh hid in a forest in the North of Iran (Jangal in
    Farsi) outside the city of Amol. This group, also known as the Jangal
    group, was involved in several clashes with the Revolutionary guards and
    ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of Amol hoping to generate a
    general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol failed. It is reported that a
    number of the group s members, revolutionary guards, and civilians were
    killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently, members of the Ettehadieh,
    including those who opposed the Amol uprising, were arrested and tried for
    belonging to the organization and for having participated in the Amol
    clash. Arrest and detention The details of Mr. Jamshid Esalat s arrest and
    detention are unknown. According to the form, he was arrested in Amol
    probably in 1963. He was detained at the prosecutor s office in Amol. He
    had several visits with his wife but denied the right to be represented by
    an attorney. Trial The details of the trial are not known. He was tried by
    the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal. Charges Mr. Esalat was charged with
    armed struggle against the regime (electronic form). Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Esalat s defense. Judgment The Revolutionary Tribunal
    condemned Mr. Jamshid Esalat to death. According to Mojahed , he was
    executed by a firing squad on August 3, 1983. The sender of the electronic
    form states that Mr. Esalat was executed in winter 1984 and that the cost
    of bullets which killed him was taken from his family.
