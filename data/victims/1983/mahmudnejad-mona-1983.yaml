    Mona Mahmudnizhad was in high school and lived with her family. She was a
    member of the Education Committee of Shiraz Baha is. Miss Mona Mahmudnejad
    (also spelled "Mahmudnizhad", a high school student and a member of the
    Education Committee in Shiraz, is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in
    a 1999 report published by the Baha i International Community. The report,
    Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community ,
    documents the persecutions of the members of the Faith in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978. Miss Mahmudnejad
    s father, also a Baha i activist, was executed in March 1983. Additional
    information was drawn from the newspaper Khabar-e Jonub , published in
    Shiraz (22 February 1983), and from various issues of the The Baha i World
    . See for example: Vol. XVIII, 1979-1983, Haifa 1986 or description of
    events as published in A Tribute to the Faithful by Mah Mihr Gulistanih,
    or Olya's Story by Olya Roohizadegan and A Congressional Hearing in World
    Order Magazine, Winter 1983-1984 edition. The Baha is in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have
    subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the
    largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in
    1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their
    most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under
    the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to
    it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the
    time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified
    and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention Miss Mona Mahmudnejad was
    arrested on the evening of 23 October 1982 at her family home. She was
    taken to the Sepah Detention Centre, where she was held incommunicado for
    a month. Her mother was finally given permission to take part in weekly
    family visits starting on 20 November. Because of her religious beliefs,
    the prison authorities considered her to be an unbeliever, and thus
    "unclean and she was subjected to humiliating treatment similar to that of
    atheist political prisoners. Prison wardens refused to have any physical
    contact with the prisoner even when, for example, they were guiding the
    blindfolded prisoner to the interrogation room. In such case guards would
    give her the end of a folded newspaper and hold the other end, avoiding
    contact. The Baha i World reports that during her detention, she was
    lashed on the soles of her feet with a cable, and forced to walk on her
    bleeding feet. She was transferred to and kept at the Adelabad Prison
    until her execution. Trial Iranian authorities gave no information to Miss
    Mahmudnejad's family regarding her trial. However, there are a few details
    available about her trial, based on the testimony of a former fellow
    prisoner, including that her release was ordered twice by the Sepah
    authorities and the bond of 500,000 Tumans was set. When her mother
    presented the required amount to the Public Prosecutor, she was ordered to
    turn herself in, due to the "crime" of membership in the Social Activities
    Committee nine years earlier. Mrs. Mahmudnejad turned herself in and was
    kept in prison for five months (Olya's Story, p. 133). According to
    reports by the the Baha i World , authorities informed Miss Mahmudnejad
    that she would be subjected to four sessions in which she would be given
    the opportunity to recant her faith and accept Islam. She was informed
    that if she did not sign a prepared statement rejecting Baha ism, she
    would be killed. It is unclear if all these sessions took place and
    whether or not these sessions replaced a trial. Charges The defendant was
    not publicly charged. However, based on statements by the religious judge
    and the defendant's interrogation sessions (as recounted by a former
    cellmate), the charges against her were related to her religious
    activities and beliefs. (World
