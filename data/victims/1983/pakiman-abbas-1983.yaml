    The information about Mr. Abbas Pakiman has been sent to Omid by an
    individual familiar with this case, via an electronic form. Mr. Pakiman
    was born in Hamedan in May/June 1952. He had a bachelor’s degree in
    business administration. He was initially a sympathizer of the Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization who later became a Marxist and joined the Arman-e
    Kargar Organization. Later he joined Razmandegan, and then the Sahand
    Organization. He was a husband and a father of one. The Sahand
    Organization (or Ettehad-e Mobarezan-e Komonist”) was founded after the
    Islamic Revolution of February 1979, with a specific focus on ideology.
    After Sahand developed the project of the Communist Party of Iran in 1982,
    and the Party was founded by Sahand and Komala and remainders of such
    Communist organizations as Peykar, Razmandegan, and some affiliates of the
    Fadaiyan Khalq. Komala in Kurdistan became the center of the Communist
    Party of Iran, whose main publication was the “Communist” monthly
    magazine. Arrest and detention The details of Mr. Pakiman’s arrest and
    detention are not known. He was arrested on Match 11, 1982. The
    Revolutionary Guardsmen interrogated him at the Joined Committee and Evin
    prison; the interrogation lasted for about one year. He had only a few
    visits with his family. Trial There is no detailed information regarding
    this trial, other than Mr. Pakiman was tried at the Joined Committee of
    the Police in September 1982. The trial lasted for 20 minutes. Charges Mr.
    Pakiman was, reportedly, charged with “opposition to the Islamic Republic,
    and membership to anti-Islamic groups.” The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt
    According to the available information, the report and testimony of the
    interrogators and the indictment were used as evidence of guilt. Defense
    No information is available concerning Mr. Pakiman’s defense. He was
    denied the right to have an attorney or access to his file. Judgment The
    court condemned Mr. Pakiman to death. Mr. Pakiman was denied the right to
    appeal to this verdict. He was shot by a firing squad in Tehran on August
    2, 1983.
