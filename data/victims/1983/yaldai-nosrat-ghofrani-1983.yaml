    The two poles of her life in Shiraz, Fars Province, were the family home
    and the local Baha i Spiritual Assembly. Ms. Nosrat Ghofrani (also spelled
    "Nusrat Ghufrani") Yalda'i, a homemaker and a member of the Local
    Spiritual Assembly in Shiraz, is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in
    a 1999 report published by the Baha i International Community. The report,
    Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community ,
    documents the persecutions of the members of the Faith in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978. Additional
    information was drawn from the newspaper Khabar-e Jonub , published in
    Shiraz (22 February 1983), and from various issues of the The Baha i World
    . See for example: Vol. XVIII, 1979-1983, Haifa 1986 or description of
    events as published in A Tribute to the Faithful by Mah Mihr Gulistanih,
    or Olya's Story by Olya Roohizadegan and A Congressional Hearing in World
    Order Magazine, Winter 1983-1984 edition and a letter written by Mr.
    Ishraqi to his family outside of Iran on 29/11/1981. The Baha is in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention Ms. Yalda'i was arrested
    on the evening of 23 October 1982 by revolutionary guards who entered her
    home about ten minutes after members of a Baha'i committee, to which her
    son belonged, had left the premises. After the guards searched their home,
    collected and removed Baha'i and other books and documents, she, along
    with her son, husband and her Baha'i neighbor were arrested and taken to
    the Sepah [Revolutionary Guards] Detention Centre, where she was
    humiliated and tortured. Because of her religious beliefs, the prison
    authorities considered her to be an unbeliever, and thus "unclean", and
    she was subjected to humiliating treatment similar to that of atheist
    political prisoners. Prison wardens refused to have any physical contact
    with the prisoner even when, for example, they were guiding the
    blindfolded prisoner to the interrogation room. In such case guards would
    give her the end of a folded newspaper and hold the other end, avoiding
    contact. During her initial interrogation on 25 October 1982, she was
    asked about the names of other members of the Local Assembly. After
    refusing to submit information about fellow Baha is, she was taken to the
    basement of the prison by a female guard, who removed some of her clothes,
    tied her to a bed facing down, and instructed a guard to flog her while
    the female guard verbally abused her, and the interrogator stood next to
    the bed holding on to her file. During that episode, she received 50
    lashes on her back and 50 on her feet (Olya's Story, p. 122). During her
    detention, she was repeatedly asked to denounce her faith publicly and
    urge other Baha is to return to Islam. As she refused to do so, she was
    beaten as many as 200 lashes twice. According to reports by former
    cellmates, weeks after she was subjected to such treatment, sore spots and
    open wounds were still visible (World Order, p. 27). While in custody, Ms.
    Yalda i faced psychological abuse by various methods including sleep
    deprivation She was also taken by the officials at night to point out
    homes of Baha is. She was confronted twice with fellow Baha'i prisoner,
    Yadu llah Mahmudnizhad and once with her son, Bahram, while the guards
    threatened to torture him.(Olya's Story, p. 125). She was kept in solitary
    confinement for 55 days with very limi
