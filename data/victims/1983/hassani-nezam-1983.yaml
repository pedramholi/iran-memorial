    Mr. Nezam Hassani is one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. This information was also sent to Omid via an electronic form by
    a person familiar with Mr. Hassani s case. According to the Mojahed , he
    belonged to the Etteha-e Komonist-ha, but the electronic form stated that
    he was affiliated with the Razmandegan Organization. The Razmandegan
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded in the
    winter of 1979. Its activities were focused on the working class and
    factories. The founding tenets of Razmandegan included the rejection of
    armed struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the
    Iranian Tudeh Party. It viewed the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist
    state and believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist
    principles. Razmandegan was among the groups that became known as Khat-e
    Se (Third line). By early 1981, disagreements on the Party s position on
    the Iran-Iraq war caused internal splits in Razmandegan. These splits,
    which coincided with the massive and brutal repression of dissidents by
    the Iranian government, caused the Organization to disband. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known except that he was arrested in 1981. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges There is not information
    regarding the charges brought against this defendant. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Hassani s defense. Judgment Mr. Nezam Hassani was
    sentenced to death by the Revolutionary court and executed in Saqez
    (Kordestan Province). No further information is available regarding this
    execution.
