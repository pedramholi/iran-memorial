    Information about Ms. Fatemeh Eidygomari is based on an electronic form
    sent to Omid by a person familiar with this case. According to this
    information, she was born in Andimeshk. Her name is also among the victims
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization and is listed on its website.
    According to this website, she was a high school student. The Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization (MKO) was founded in 1965. This organization adapted
    the principals of Islam as its ideological guideline. However, its members
    interpretation of Islam was revolutionary, and they believed in armed
    struggle against the Shah s regime. They valued Marxism as a progressive
    method for economic and social analysis but considered Islam as their
    source of inspiration, culture, and ideology. In the 1970s, the MKO was
    weakened when many of its members were imprisoned and executed. In 1975,
    following a deep ideological crisis, the organization refuted Islam as its
    ideology and, after a few of its members were killed and other Muslim
    members purged, the organization proclaimed Marxism as its ideology. This
    move led to a split of the Marxist-Leninist Section of the MKO, in 1977.
    In January of 1979, the imprisoned Muslim leaders of the MKO were
    released, along with other political prisoners. They began to re-organize
    the MKO and to recruit new members, based on Islamic ideology. After the
    1979 Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the MKO
    accepted the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini and supported the
    Revolution. Active participation in the political scene and infiltration
    of governmental institutions were foremost on the organization s agenda.
    During the first two years after the Revolution, the MKO succeeded in
    recruiting numerous sympathizers, especially in high schools and
    universities; but its efforts to gain political power, whether by
    appointment or election, were strongly opposed by the Islamic Republic s
    leaders.* Arrest and Detention According to the information sent to Omid,
    she was arrested in Animeshk and transferred to Dezful Prison for
    interrogation. No further information is available on the details of her
    arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on Ms. Eidygomari
    s trial. Charges The charge brought against Ms. Eidygomari is not known.
    Evidence of Guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against Ms. Eidygomari.
    Defense No information is available on Ms. Eidygomari s defense. Judgment
    According to the information sent to Omid, Ms. Fatemeh Eidygomari was
    executed by firing squad in 1983. According to the website of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization, she was executed in Dezful.
    _________________________ * The exclusion of MKO members from government
    offices and the closure of their centers and publishing houses, in
    conjunction with the Islamic Republic authorities different interpretation
    of Islam, widened the gap between the two. Authorities of the new regime
    referred to the Mojahedin as hypocrites, and the Hezbollahi supporters of
    the regime attacked the Mojahedin sympathizers regularly during
    demonstrations and while distributing publications, leading to the death
    of several MKO supporters. On June 20, 1981, the MKO called for a
    demonstration protesting their treatment by governmental officials and the
    government officials efforts to impeach their ally, President Abolhassan
    Banisadr. Despite the fact that the regime called this demonstration
    illegal, thousands came to the streets, some of whom confronted the
    Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollahis. The number of casualties that
    resulted from this demonstration is unknown, but a large number of
    demonstrators were arrested and executed in the following days and weeks.
    The day after the demonstration, the Islamic Republic regime started a
    repressive campaign unprecedented in modern Iranian history. Thousands of
    MKO members and sympathizers were arrested or executed. On June 21, 1981,
    the MKO announced an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic and
    assassinated a number of high-ranking officials and supporters of the
    Islamic regime. In the summer of 1981, the leader of the MKO and the
    impeached President (Banisadr) fled Iran to reside in France, where they
    founded the National Council of Resistance. After the MKO leaders and many
    of its members were expelled from France, they went to Iraq and founded
    the National Liberation Army of Iran in 1987, which entered Iranian
    territory a few times during the Iran-Iraq war. They were defeated in July
    1988 during their last operation, the Forugh Javidan operation. A few days
    after this operation, thousands of imprisoned Mojahedin supporters were
    killed during the mass executions of political prisoners in 1988. Ever
    since the summer of 1981, the MKO has continued its activities outside of
    Iran. No information is available regarding members and activities of the
    MKO inside the country. In spite of the armed struggle announcement by the
    MKO on June 20, 1981, many sympa
