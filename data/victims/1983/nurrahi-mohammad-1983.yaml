circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Nurzehi, along with 10 others, was announced
    in a communiqu by the public relations of the Islamic Revolution s Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Sistan and Baluchestan. The communiqu was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on October 1, 1983. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr.
    Nurzehi was repotedly charged with importing 5 kg of heroin, 26? (the
    amount of hashish is illegible.) of hashish and a Colt as well as being
    actively involved in drug dealing. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Nurzehi's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sistan
    and Baluchestan sentenced Mr. Nurzehi to death. Having been confirmed by
    the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out in public in
    the Addicts Rehabilitation Center.
