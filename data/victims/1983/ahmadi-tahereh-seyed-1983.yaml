    Ms. Tahereh Seyed Ahmadi (under the name Seyed Abri) is one of the 1,533
    executed prisoners listed by the Association of Iranian Women of Köln
    (Germany). The list, published on September 10, 1997, is entitled: "A
    Partial List of Women Executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran.” This list
    has been updated by former political prisoners living throughout the
    world. Ms. Tahereh Seyed Ahmadi (under the name Seyed Abe’i) is one of the
    12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The
    list includes individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who
    were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security
    forces from June, 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. The
    additional information about Ms. Seyed Ahmadi is taken from the book "Our
    Martyrs on the Path to Freedom" by Rah-e Kargar Publications. She was a
    sympathizer of Rah-e Kargar Organization. She was also a nursing student
    and was married with one son. Along with some coworkers, she established a
    free clinic in the poor area of Zurabad, Karj. Her husband, a sympathizer
    of the same Organization, was executed as well. "Rah-e Kargar" or the
    "Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran" was established in the summer
    of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various leftist
    groups who rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in political
    action. They identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a
    socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed
    with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the
    Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership. Arrest and detention

    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available about the defendant’s defense. Judgment No

    According to the above source, Ms. Tahereh Seyed Ahmadi was executed by a
    firing squad at Evin prison on April 26, 1983. In her will, she addressed
    her parents: “I love you from the bottom of my heart. I always think about
    you. I recall how you worked hard through difficulties to raise us. My
    dears, Nuri and I started a sweet and productive life together. But,
    regretfully, destiny didn’t give us more time to be together.” According
    to the source, the prison officials crossed out several lines of the will.
