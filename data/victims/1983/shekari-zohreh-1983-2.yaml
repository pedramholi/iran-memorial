    News of the execution of Ms. Zohreh Shekari, child of Shahdokht and Ali
    Akbar, was confirmed in an Abdorrahman Boroumand Center interview (on
    September 5, and 12, 2018) with a person close to her. News of this
    execution was also transmitted to the Center through four electronic
    forms. Ms. Shekari is one of 430 individuals whose name appears in the
    Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    list, published in the Andisheye Peykar website. This list contains the
    names of Pykar Organization members who have been arrested and executed
    after the 1979 Revolution. More than 400 individuals whose names appear on
    this list have been executed. Additional information about this case was
    gathered from the writings of a high school and college friend (August 27,
    2018) and those of a fellow Peykar member (September 2, 2018). Ms. Shekari
    was born on September 15, 1956, in the city of Rasht in a non-religious
    family. She finished 11thgrade at Forough High School in Rasht and
    subsequently went to Tehran to finish 12thgrade there. After obtaining her
    high school diploma at Kharazmi High School in 1974, she was accepted to
    Aryamehr University of Technology (currently named Sharif University of
    Technology) to study petro-chemistry. She became politically active in
    college and joined the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class. Ms. Shekari moved to the city of Karaj after she was
    married and taught at a girls school in that city. According to Ms.
    Shekari s high school and college friend, Zohreh was a studious, gracious,
    serious, and kind person, and her beauty, in addition to her other
    character traits, had made her one of the most popular students at high
    school. On many occasions, students from lower grades would wait for her
    outside the classroom to give her flowers. (Writings of her high school
    friend, August 27, 2018). One of her Peykar Organization friends described
    her as a lively and energetic young woman of dazzling beauty, with big,
    penetrating eyes and full lips, always brewing with smiles and humor .
    According to this person, attention to the rights of children and young
    adults was one of Zohreh s most important ideas, and she used methods of
    empowering children and their innovations in her instruction . (Writing of
    her Peykar Organization friend, September 2, 2018). In Karaj, Ms. Shekari
    conducted her political activities under the assumed name Naheed Rashti,
    along with Karaj College of Agriculture students supporting the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class. Reading classic
    Marxist theory books and planning for organizing high school and college
    students were among their most important activities. One of the most
    important subjects that came up at the meetings was self-defense and
    fleeing government agents and supporters while selling the Organization s
    publication. Ms. Shekari was in charge of watching over younger activists.
    In cooperation with student supporters of the Peykar Organization and
    other activists, she published The Cry of Zurabad Publication which dealt
    with the daily problems of the city of Karaj s marginalized and poor
    neighborhood of Zurabad (Eslamabad), including dirt roads and lack of
    proper streets, security, water, electricity, and sewage systems. (Writing
    of her Peykar Organization friend, September 2, 2018). The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention Based on available information, Ms. Shekari was arrested in
    late July 1981 at the Tehran [bus] Terminal. She was on her way to Rasht
    and was arrested by the agents while she was writing slogans on the door
    of a phone kiosk. Ms. Shekari had told the officers that she lived at her
    aunt s (her mother s sister s) home. The officers took her to her aunt s
    and she confirmed that Ms. Shekari lived with her. The agents then took
    Ms. Shekari to Evin Prison. (Boroumand Center interviews with a person
    close to Ms. Shekari). Ms. Shekari was detained for two years and eight
    months in various prisons including Evin, Gohardasht, and the
    Revolutionary Guards prison in the city of Rasht. She had not been tried
    as an official member of the Peykar Organization until
