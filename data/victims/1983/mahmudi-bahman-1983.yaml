    Mr. Bahman Mahmudi is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. According to this report, Mr. Bahman Mahmudi was the
    brother of Mr. Morteza Mahmudi who was executed in Tehran in August of
    1984. They both were active members of the Student Confederation in the
    US. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a “Social imperialist” state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. The Confederation of Iranian Students, National Union, (CISNU)
    was the outcome of a 1962 merger of Iranian students’ associations formed
    two years earlier in Europe and the United States with the aim of
    promoting cooperation, strengthening students groups, and informing them
    of their rights and obligations. The Confederation was composed mainly of
    members or sympathizers of the National Front and the Tudeh. During the
    first years of its activities, the organization’s leadership was dominated
    by the National Front supporters. In the 1960s and 1970s, the
    Confederation became a significant opposition force outside Iran, bringing
    media visibility to political prisoners and repression in Iran. In 1971,
    the Iranian government declared the CISNU illegal. The Confederation
    radicalized progressively and by the mid-1970s, it was dominated by
    pro-guerrilla student organizations. Its new Charter (1975) explicitly
    called for the overthrow of the Shah’s regime. After the Islamic
    Revolution most of its members returned to Iran. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No
    information is available on Mr. Mahmudi’s charges. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mahmudi’s defense. Judgment According to the list of
    Martyrs of the Peykar Organization, Mr. Bahman Mahmudi was executed on
    April 18, 1983. No specific information is available about the defendant’s
    execution.
