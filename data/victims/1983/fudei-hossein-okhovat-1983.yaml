    Information about Mr. Hossein Okhovat Fude i has been taken from an
    interview with a relative. He is one of the 430 individuals whose name
    appears on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. This execution was also announced in the addendum of the
    Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization
    on September 6, 1985. The list includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated
    with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes
    with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the
    publication date of the magazine. Mr. Okhovat Fude i was about 20 years
    old and was the younger child in his family. His father owned a piece of
    land in Pudeh village (Esfehan province) where he grew up. He then
    migrated to Esfehan (city) and started working as a welder. In Esfehan he
    came to know the Peykar Organization and later he joined this
    Organization. He was an energetic and idealist. The Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of
    dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    The exact circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not
    known. He was arrested in Esfehan in 1982. He was detained briefly in the
    same city. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges The charges brought against Mr. Okhovat Fudeh i are not known.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on the defense. Judgment The details of the
    verdict leading to this execution are not known. Mr. Hossein Fude i was
    executed in February/March of 1983 in Esfehan.
