    The execution of Mr. Majid Sadeqlu, son of Abbas Ali, along with nineteen
    other individuals, was announced in a communiqué from the Anti-Narcotics
    Section of the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran. This communiqué was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper on December 8, 1983. Additional
    information has been sent to Omid via two electronic forms by individuals
    familiar with this case. According to this forms, Mr. Sadelqu was born in
    1953 in Tehran or Ramian (Golestan province). Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial There is no information regarding this trial. Charges According to
    the official communiqué, Mr. Sadeqlu was charged with “being consistently
    and actively involved in the purchase and distribution of heroin,
    establishing an international professional drug-trafficking gang”. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution referred to “possessing 2.637 kg of heroin when
    arrested, confessing to dealing heroin twice before, and having a previous
    record of repeated drug dealing.” International human rights organizations
    have repeatedly condemned the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
    for its systematic use of severe torture and solitary confinement to
    obtain confessions from detainees and have questioned the authenticity of
    confessions obtained under duress. In the case of political detainees,
    these confessions are, at times, televised. The National Television
    broadcasts confessions during which prisoners plead guilty to vague and
    false charges, repent and renounce their political beliefs, and/or
    implicate others. Human rights organizations have also pointed to the
    pattern of retracted confessions by those prisoners who are freed. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Sadeqlu’s defense. Judgment One of the
    tribunals of the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor’s Office
    in Tehran sentenced Mr. Majid Sadeqlu to death. He was shot by a firing
    squad on December 7, 1983.
