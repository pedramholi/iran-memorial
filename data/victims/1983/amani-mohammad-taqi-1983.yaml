    Information about Mr. Mohammad Taqi Amani was obtained from an Omid
    Memorial electronic form filled in by a friend who went to college with
    him, as well as from a book published by Rah-e Kargar titled Our Martyrs
    for Freedom and Socialism . Additional information about Mr. Amani s
    detention was obtained from one of his former fellow inmates. The news of
    Mr. Amani s execution also appeared in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    published by the People s Mojahedin of Iran Organization (No 261,
    September 6, 1985). The addendum lists 12028 individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Mr. Amani was born in 1955 in Zanjan to a working
    class family. He was a student at the Social Science Faculty of Tehran
    University and was active in student and anti-monarchy movements before
    the revolution. In 1976, he was arrested and sentenced to five years in
    prison, but he was released in 1979. He started his collaboration with
    Rah-e Kargar Organization shortly after. He had an extensive social
    network, was calm and graceful, and very popular among his friends and
    others. He enjoyed reading, thinking, and debating. Rah-e Kargar or
    Organization of the Revolutionary Workers of Iran announced its existence
    in July 1979. The organization consisted of various leftist groups that
    opposed guerilla warfare, were in favor of political opposition, and
    proclaimed themselves as Marxist-Leninists for socialist revolution and
    rule of the proletariat. They differed from the Tudeh Party (communist
    party supportive of the Soviet Union) in that they opposed the Islamic
    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini s leadership from the beginning. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Amani, a resident of Tehran, was dispatched by the
    Organization to Tabriz for organizational activities since the spring of
    1981. Based on the report in the book published by Rah e Kargar, Mr. Amani
    was arrested randomly along with 40 other young people on a Tabriz street.
    His former fellow inmate testified that Mr. Amani was heavily tortured but
    did not reveal any information about his role in the Organization. About a
    year later, when further information about his activities was disclosed,
    he was tortured once again, this time for ten days. Trial Mr. Amani was
    tried twice. The fist time, he was sentenced to life in prison. But a year
    later, upon receiving new information, they took him to court again and
    this time he was sentenced to death. The details of his trials remain
    unknown. Charges No information about the charges brought against Mr.
    Amani is available. He was not allowed to have an attorney during his
    detention and trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Amani s defense.
    Judgment The details of the verdict are unknown. According to a friend who
    went to college with the defendant, the news of Mr. Amani s execution was
    published in one of the nation s official newspapers in early November,
    1981. This is while a former fellow inmate saw him in Tabriz Prison after
    this date, some time in late November or December, 1981. In the list
    prepared by the People s Mojahedin of Iran Organization, the date of Mr.
    Amani s execution is mentioned as February 17, 1983. He was executed in
    Tabriz. Mr. Amani received a visit from his mother before his execution in
    the prison. The book published by Rah e Kargar reports that he looked at
    his mother with tears in his eyes and said: Mother, don t think that I m
    crying. These are only tears of joy. I m happy that I was able to succeed.
