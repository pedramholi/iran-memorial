    The execution of Mr. Hemat Noruzi, along with five others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on October 5, 1983. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr.
    Noruzi was reportedly charged with repeated armed robberies. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Each year, Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Noruzi's defense. Judgment The report
    provides no information regarding the tribunal that sentenced Mr. Noruzi
    but specifies that the Islamic Revolution Supreme Court confirmed the
    death sentence, which was carried out.
