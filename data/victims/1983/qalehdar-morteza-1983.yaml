    h2>About this Case News of the execution of Mr. Morteza Qal'edar and his
    will were published in the Peykargar magazine (publication of the Peykar
    Student Union in West Berlin), number 6, in February of 1985. Mr. Qal'edar
    is also one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of
    “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains
    the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. Further information was provided by one of his former
    comrades. According to Peykargar , Mr. Morteza Qal'edar was born in 1953
    in Borujerd (in the western province of Lorestan). He entered Tabriz
    University in 1969. After the revolution, he participated in founding a
    group called "The Revolutionaries for the Liberation of the Working
    Class." This group joined the Peykar organization in 1980. He was active
    in a Southern District of the organization and then joined the Khuzestan
    Committee of the Peykar organization. According to his comrade, Mr.
    Qal'edar was a courteous and kind man with a great sense of
    responsibility. He was married and had a daughter. The Peykar Organization
    for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a number of
    dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to
    Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of political
    organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding tenets of
    Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong stand
    against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed
    the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that China had
    deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to the Peykargar publication, Mr. Morteza Qal'edar was preparing
    to leave the country, but was arrested a few days before his departure
    when attempting to visit the hiding place of his documents and books in
    order to give them to his comrades. No other detail is known about his
    arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Qal'edar’s charges.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant.
    However, according to the Peykargar report, he was identified by the
    regime's agents in prison. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Qal'edar's defense. Judgment According to the Peykargar report, Mr.
    Qal'edar was executed by firing squad in Tehran on November 29, 1983. The
    will left for his mother is dated November 29, 1983. He says in his will,
    “My good dear mother, I’m sorry that I was unable to provide for you and
    could not present you with everything that would make you happy... I only
    wish you joy and success. I greet my beloved wife and daughter. I wish
    them health and happiness...”
