    Information about Ms. Zohreh Hajian Sepoleh has been obtained from an Omid
    Memorial electronic form filled in by one of her former fellow inmates in
    Section 209 of Evin Prison. Ms. Hajian was an activist with the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization (Ashraf Dehqani) branch since the previous regime. Her
    brother had been executed for the same reason in 1972, before the
    Revolution. The Fadaiyan Khalq Guerilla Organization, a Marxist Leninist
    group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of
    Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the Organization renounced
    armed struggle, but some of the former members who remained faithful to
    guerilla combat formed an independent Fadaiyan Khalq Guerilla group, known
    as the Ashraf Dehqani branch. Arrest and detention The details of Ms.
    Hajian’s arrest are not known. She spent the entirety of her detention in
    Section 209 of Evin Prison (Ward 6). The ward consisted of solitary cells,
    interrogation rooms, and a basement used for torture. Ms. Hajian was
    denied an attorney, access to her file, or family visits. She spent most
    of her detention and interrogation period in solitary confinement. Only
    for a short while, she shared a cell with Nasrin Nikseresht, who was also
    executed. Ms. Hajian had a small stature and was severely tortured. Trial
    No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The charges
    against the defendant are unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms. Hajian’s
    defense. Judgment Ms. Zohreh Hajian Sepoleh was executed by a firing squad
    at Evin Prison in the winter of 1983. The details of her sentence and the
    exact date of her execution are not known.
