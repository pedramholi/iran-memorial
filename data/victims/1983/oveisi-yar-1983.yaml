    The information about Mr. Yar Oveisi is taken from the book "The Tudeh
    Martyrs" by The Tudeh Party of Iran Publications. He worked in the
    Kermanshah Registration Office. He was a previous member of the Tudeh
    Party in 1950s. After the revolution, he joined the party again. In 1980,
    he was fired from his job because of his affiliation with the Tudeh Party.
    He went to Tehran and worked for a construction company. In May 1983, he
    was arrested but released a week later. The Tudeh Party of Iran was
    created in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it
    supported the former Soviet Union's policies. The Party played a major
    role in Iran's political scene until it was banned for the second time
    following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party
    declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and therefore actively supported the
    new government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr.
    Yar Oveisi was arrested for the second time in June 1983. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information
    is available on Mr. Yar Oveisi’s charges. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution contains no evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available about the defendant’s
    defense. Judgment According to the above book, Mr. Yar Oveisi died after
    he had been tortured for several days after his arrest in June 1983. The
    regime's agents informed his family that "his body has been found in a
    northern city." No information is available about the possibility of any
    ruling against the defendant.
