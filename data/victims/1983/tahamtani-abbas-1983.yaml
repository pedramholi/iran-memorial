    The information about Mr. Abbas Tahamtani is based on an electronic form
    sent to Omid by a person familiar with his case. According to the existing
    information, he was born in Khoy in 1962. He grew up in a middle-class
    family, had a high school diploma, and was a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan
    Khalq Minority Organization. Mr. Abbas Tahamtani is one of the 12,028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No. 261),
    published by the Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with Islamic Republic security forces from June
    1981 to the publication date of the magazine. His name is also published
    by the Fadaiyan Khalq Minority Organization in its victims list, In Memory
    of Unknown Fadai Victims. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist-Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. In 1981, the FKO, which had opted
    for open political and electoral activity after the revolution, split over
    the critique of the concept of urban guerilla warfare and the support of
    the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority
    opposed the Islamic Republic, and though it did not abandon the theory of
    armed struggle, its activities were mainly limited to the political arena
    and the labor movement. Following the Mojahedin Khalq Organization s June
    21st declaration of armed struggle, the Fadaiyan announced the
    organization of combatant cells. However, based on available information,
    these cells did not become operational. Many of the groups members and
    supporters were arrested and executed in the early 1980 s. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of Abbas Tahamtani s arrest and detention are
    not known. According to information sent to Omid, he was arrested by the
    Revolutionary Guards in Khoy in November of 1982. He was detained and
    interrogated at the Basij Center in Khoy. He was denied access to an
    attorney, and his family was unaware of where he was for some time.
    According to this report, he was interrogated for three months. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Tahamtani s trial. According to the
    information sent to Omid, his trial took place in Orumieh in the spring of
    1983. Quoting an eye witness, the trial session lasted only 15 to 20
    minutes. Charges According to the information sent to Omid, the charges
    against Mr. Tahamtani were announced in the indictment as sympathizing
    with Aqalyatte [the Fadaiyan Khalq Minority Organization] and creating
    study groups. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained, given the absence of the basic guarantees
    of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of Mr. Tahamtani s execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against him.
    Defense No information is available about Mr. Tahamtani s defense.
    According to information sent to Omid (quoting a person being present at
    the court), Mr. Tahamtani defended his organization s beliefs. Judgment No
    specific information is available about Mr. Tahamtani s execution.
    According to the existing information, he was executed by firing squad in
    the evening of his trial day, in 1983. The location of his execution,
    according to the electronic form, was Orumieh. However, other sources
    reported it as Khoy. The family received the body and buried it at the old
    cemetery of their town.
