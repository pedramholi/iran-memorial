    The information about Mr. Daryush Fazeli has been drawn from the Tufan
    Party website, and a person close to Mr. Fazeli has confirmed the
    information. Mr. Dariush Fazeli (Tufan) is also one of the 12028
    individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Mr. Fazeli was born in
    1961 in Mahmudabad in Mazandaran Province. His high school years coincided
    with the movement that led to the fall of the monarchy. He started his
    political activism at that time and became a sympathizer of the Tufan
    Patry. He was popular among the students, and he soon became the leader of
    an affiliate of the Party called the High School Students’ Union – Red
    Saturday. After he finished his third year of high school in Mahmudabad,
    he left school and started to work full-time on political activities. Mr.
    Fazeli, his brother, Qodrat Fazeli, and brother-in-law, Janbarar Ruhi,
    (both of whom were executed by the Islamic Republic) informed the public
    in villages of Mazandaran about the Party and its activities. According to
    the information available, farmers respected and loved them. Mr. Fazeli
    was arrested and detained three times. After June 20, 1981, the repression
    of dissidents and opponents intensified, and Daryush left Mazandaran to
    start an underground life in Tehran. In Tehran, he lived with his uncle.
    However, in July 1981, a relative disclosed his identity to the
    Revolutionary Guards, who arrested Mr. Fazeli at his uncle’s house in
    Tehran and transported him to Amol in Mazandaran. In Amol, the religious
    judge condemned him to death. However, the night before they planned to
    execute him, Mr. Fazeli escaped from prison through the bathroom window
    and local residents helped him flee to Tehran. He continued his activism
    in the capital, until the Party transferred him to Esfahan. The
    Marxist-Leninist Organization of Tufan was founded in the late 1960s.
    De-Stalinization policy of Khoroshev in the Soviet Union led to a
    political crisis in Iranian communist party Tudeh, as in many communist
    parties around the world. Three Tudeh leaders i.e. Forutan, Qasemi Saqa’i
    left the Party in 1963 to found the “Revolutionary Organization of the
    Tudeh Party” and then the “Marxist-Leninist Organization of Tufan”. The
    organization changed its name after the 1979 revolution and first became
    The Party of workers and farmers of Iran and later on Iran Work Party,
    Tufan. The Party believed in a one-party system and supported a political
    system modeled after Albania, which it considered as the only socialist
    countries. The Organization of Struggling Workers of Iran is a split from
    Tufan founded by some of the party’s personnel. Arrest and detention The
    details of Mr. Fazeli’s arrest and detention are not known. He was
    arrested in November or December of 1982. He was tortured in custody.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant’s trial. Charges The
    charge brought against the defendant is not known. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Fazeli’s defense. Judgment Mr. Daryush Fazeli was
    executed in October 1983.
