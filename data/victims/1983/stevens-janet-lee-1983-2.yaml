    Janet Lee Stevens was one of 63 victims of the bombing of the American
    Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which took place on April 18, 1983. At
    approximately 1:05 PM, a truck loaded with nearly 2,000 pounds of
    explosives careened through the driveway of the American embassy and
    crashed into the building. A massive explosion ripped through all seven
    levels of the embassy, sending debris flying hundreds of feet into the air
    and causing the burning building to collapse on itself. In addition to
    those who lost their lives, at least 120 people were injured. At the time,
    it was the deadliest attack on an American diplomatic mission since World
    War II. Ms. Stevens was born in Sanigaw, Michigan on December 1, 1950. In
    college, she studied five languages, but the one she loved most was
    Arabic. Her interest in the Arab world took her to Cairo, Tunisia, and
    finally Lebanon, where she arrived in 1981. While living in Lebanon, she
    was simultaneously a social activist with Amnesty International, a Ph.D.
    student in Arabic literature at the University of Pennsylvania, and a
    freelance journalist for several international publications. She loved her
    experience in Lebanon and enthusiastically wrote her twin sister that in
    Lebanon, she was doing the best writing I have done in my life, because
    here one must do one s utmost. Humane, talented, self-reliant, ambitious,
    fearless, and rebellious, a former editor described her; she also loved
    playing the guitar. Years after her death, Palestinians in the Burj
    al-Barajneh camp still remembered her: one, interviewed twenty years after
    the bombing, exclaimed at the mention of her name: Janet Stevens? you mean
    Miss Janet! Of course I remember her! We called her the little drummer
    girl. She had so much energy. She cared about the Palestinians. That was
    so long ago. She stopped coming to visit us. I don t know why. How is she?
    On April 18, 1983, Ms. Stevens was visiting the U.S. embassy for an
    in-depth interview with William McIntyre, Deputy Director of USAID in
    Lebanon. She and Mr. McIntyre were having lunch in the embassy cafeteria
    when the bomb detonated just meters from where they were sitting; both
    were instantly killed. At the time of her death, Ms. Stevens was the
    partner of Dr. Franklin Lamb and pregnant with their first child. She was
    32 years old. Background Ms.Stevens is in Omid because of the overwhelming
    evidence connecting the Islamic Republic of Iran to the 1983 bombing at
    the American embassy in Beirut. This attack, claimed by a group called
    Islamic Jihad, was the first in a series of related bombings carried out
    in Lebanon between 1983 and 1984, which claimed at least 396 lives. In the
    early 1980s, Lebanon was a highly volatile country, home to conflicting
    military and political agendas and where the Islamic Republic exercised
    growing influence with the stated aim of spreading the Islamic Revolution.
    Already hostile to American influence in the Middle East and further
    angered by the United States military support of Iraq, Iran s foe in the
    Iran-Iraq war, the Islamic Republic s leaders became exasperated when,
    following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the summer of 1982, the
    United States brokered a Lebanese-Israeli truce and deployed a large
    contingent of American servicemen in the framework of a Multinational
    Peacekeeping Force. Islamic Jihad was a heretofore little-noticed group
    known only for a string of grenade attacks launched on French, Italian,
    and American members of the Multinational Force in March of 1983. When it
    claimed responsibility for the embassy bombing, Islamic Jihad declared
    that the attack was part of the Iranian revolution s campaign against
    imperialist targets throughout the world. The group promised that We shall
    keep striking at any imperialist presence in Lebanon, including the
    Multinational Force. (Two massive bomb attacks against American and French
    servicemen indeed followed on October 23, 1983). Islamic Jihad was a
    shadowy subset of Hezbollah (Party of God), a radical, armed Shi ite
    organization with deep ideological and organizational ties to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. As early as August of 1979, Iran s Supreme Leader,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, had alluded to the establishment of a Party of God
    that would unite Muslims around the goal of resisting American and Israeli
    designs for the Middle East. So far, the oppressed have been disunited and
    nothing happens through disunity. Now that an example of the unity of the
    downtrodden has materialized in the land of Muslims [the Islamic
    Revolution], this example will have to be applied in a wider context, to
    encompass all humanity, through the establishment of a Party of the
    Downtrodden, which is the same as the Party of God [ Hezbollah ], and
    which is in line with the exalted will of God Past mistakes must be
    rectified through Muslim unity and the establishment of the Party of the
    Downtrodden against the great powers, led by the criminal America and its
    very corrupt stooge, Israel. * Punishing those who su
