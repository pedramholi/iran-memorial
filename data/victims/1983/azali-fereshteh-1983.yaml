    Ms. Fereshteh Azali is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum
    to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Ms. Azali is also one of the 1,533 executed
    prisoners listed by the Association of Iranian Women of Köln (Germany).
    The list published in 1997 is entitled: "A partial list of names of women
    executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran." Additional information about
    Ms. Azali was sent via an electronic form by a person informed about her
    case. According to this information, Ms. Azali was born in Amol in 1962 in
    a working class family. She was a sympathizer of the Ettehadieh
    Komonist-ha (the Communists’ Union). The Ettehadieh Komonist-ha was
    created by exiled opponents of the Pahlavi regime who mostly belonged to
    the Student Confederation. They followed the teachings of Mao Tse-Tung but
    did not believe in guerilla warfare. The group became marked by
    ideological divides during the periods preceding and following the 1979
    revolution which caused it to split into several factions. One of the most
    important rifts was triggered by the decision by a number of members to
    take up arms and take over a city in Iran. The uprising plan, devised in
    the midst of an active and violent anti-communist campaign by the
    revolutionary Islamic government, split the Ettehadieh in two factions:
    one believed in the armed movement and the other opposed it. In the winter
    of 1982, armed members of the Ettehadieh hid in a forest in the North of
    Iran (Jangal in Farsi) outside the city of Amol. This group, also known as
    the Jangal group, was involved in several clashes with the revolutionary
    guards and ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of Amol hoping to
    generate a general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol failed. It is
    reported that a number of the group’s members, revolutionary guards, and
    civilians were killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently, members of the
    Ettehadieh, including those who opposed the Amol uprising, were arrested
    and tried for belonging to the organization and for having participated in
    the Amol clash. Arrest and detention There is no specific information on
    the accused’s arrest and detention. Trial No information is available on
    Ms. Azali’s trial. Charges The charges against Ms. Azali are unknown. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this accused cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    Evidence of guilt The report of Ms. Azali’s execution did not provide any
    specific information on the evidence presented against her. Defense No
    information is available on Ms. Azali’s defense. Judgment Based on the
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine, Ms. Azali was executed by a firing squad
    in Amol in 1982. According to the information provided by the electronic
    form, her execution date was January 8, 1983.
