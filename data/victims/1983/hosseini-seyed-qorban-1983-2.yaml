    News and information of the execution of Mr. Seyed Qorban Hosseini, son of
    Seyedeh Ezat and Seyed Vali, was sent to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center via
    an electronic form by a person close to him on December 18, 2018. (E-form
    12-18-18) News of execution of Mr. Hosseini along with four other persons
    was also announced by the Public Relations of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Islam Abad-e Gharb and reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on
    January 9, 1982. In addition, he is one of the 12028 individuals listed in
    an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. His name is also included ion the list of executed
    people published by the Fadayian Khalq Organization. Additional
    information has been collected from a letter by his family members. Mr.
    Hosseini was born in Gahvareh city in Kermanshah. He was single, had high
    school diploma, and was a math teacher. He was a supporter of Fadayian
    Khalq Minority Organization. Mr. Hosseini spent some of his teaching time
    in Ilam Province and started his job in Kermanshah towards the end of 70s.
    He and some of his coworkers, among them Hormoz Gorji Bayani , established
    the Kermanshah Teacher Union in 1978. Family members, relatives, people
    from his home village, and his coworkers described him as a person with
    charismatic and at the same time diplomatic personality. He was so
    attached to the problems and concerns of the people and his social
    activities were the major part of his life. His social and political
    activities started in the spring of 1979. (Letter from the family members)
    Being expelled from the Ministry of Education in 1980, Mr. Hosseini
    returned to Gahvareh village and mainly did farming while getting ready to
    get married. The Fadayian Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin
    America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of theSoviet Union. The Fadayian Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic
    Republic and was mainly active in the political arena and the labor
    movement. Arrest and detention I his return from Eslam Abad-e Gharb in
    June 1982, Mr. Hosseini was arrested in Kermanshah. Upon arrest, he was
    interrogated and tortured in the detention center of Islamic Revolutionary
    Komite of Islam Abad-e Gharb. After several weeks, they transferred him to
    solitary confinement in Dizelabad Prison in Kermanshah. Mr. Hosseini was
    in prison for 7 months. His last visit with his family was in the first
    week of October 1982. (Letter from the family members) Trial The Islamic
    Revolutionary Court of Eslam Abad-e Gharb tried Mr. Hosseini (Jomhuri
    Eslami newspaper). He was not allowed to have a lawyer and the details of
    his trial session/s are not known. Charges Mr. Hosseini was reported to be
    charged with membership in the Fadaiyan Khalq Guerilla Organization
    (Minority Faction) and active involvement in that organization, and being
    in charge of its military wing. (Jomhuri Eslami Newspaper) The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic authorities have brought trumped-up charges,
    including drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences, against
    their opponents (including political, civil society activists, as well as
    unionists and ethnic and religious minorities). Each year Iranian
    authorities sentence to death hundreds of alleged common criminals,
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted and executed based on trumped-up
    charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does
    not contain information regarding the evidence provided against Mr.
    Hosseini. Defense No information is available on Mr. Hosseini s defense.
    Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Court of Eslam Abad-e Gharb sentenced
    Mr. Seyed Qorban to death and the Islamic Revolution s Supreme Tribunal of
    Qom, confirmed the sentence. Mr. Hosseini was executed by firing squad in
    Dizelabad Prison in Kermanshah on January 09, 1983. Mr. Hosseini s body
    was given to the family. In spite of a lot of pressure from the
    Revolutionary Komite, the family organized a memorial ceremony with the
    attendance of many people. The execution of Seyed Qorban Hosseini had a
    very deep and reparable effect on the family; a close family member says:
    Executing Seyed was like executing the whole family .
