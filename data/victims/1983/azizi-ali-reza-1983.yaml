    The execution of Mr. Ali Reza Azizi, along with nineteen others, was
    announced in a communiqu from the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. This communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami Daily on December 8, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to
    the official communiqu , Mr. Azizi was charged with being consistently and
    actively involved in the purchase and distribution of heroin, establishing
    an international professional drug-trafficking gang, possessing 2.637 kg
    of heroin when arrested, confessing to dealing heroin twice before, and
    having a previous record of repeated drug dealing. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Azizi s
    defense. Judgment One of the tribunals of the Anti-Narcotics Section of
    the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran sentenced Mr. Azizi to death. The
    sentence was carried out at dawn.
