    Mr. Ahmad Shirazi is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the
    list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list
    contains the names of those members of the organization who died after the
    revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have
    been executed. The information about Mr. Shirazi has been taken from the
    book An Unequal Battle: a report of seven years in prison, from 1982 to
    1989 by Nima Parvaresh published by Andeesheh va Peykar in 1995. According
    to this report, the writer had been a cellmate with the defendant in Evin
    prison. Mr. Shirazi was a Peykar activist who turned to activity in
    factory circles in Tehran after the leaders of Peykar were arrested. The
    Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by
    a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social imperialist" state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Shirazi was arrested in March of 1983. Trial Mr. Shirazi
    was taken from Interrogation Room 209 to the court two months after his
    arrest. No further information is available on the trial. Charges No
    information is available on Mr. Shirazi's charges. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense According to the
    available information, Mr. Shirazi defended his organization and Marxism
    in the court. Judgment Mr. Shirazi was executed in Evin prison on August
    13, 1983. He was 24.
