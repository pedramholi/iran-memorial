    The information about Mr. Hossein Okhovat Moqaddam has been drawn from an
    interview with a relative. He is one of the 430 individuals whose name
    appears on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the
    Liberation of the Working Class published on the website of Peykar
    Andeesheh. This execution was also announced in the addendum of the
    Mojahed magazine, No. 261, published by the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization
    on September 6, 1985. Additional information has been taken from the
    Peykargar magazine (No. 6, Feb. 1995), the publication of the Union of
    Peykargar Students for the Liberation of the Working Class. Mr. Okhovat
    Moqaddam started his political activism during the previous regime.
    According to the interviewee, he was arrested for the first time in a
    demonstration in 1969 protesting to the increase of bus fares in Tehran.
    Having been released from prison, he went to Dubai to initiate contact
    with Palestinian groups and stayed there for 7 months. After returning to
    Iran, he was re-arrested and imprisoned for 2 years. After he was freed,
    he resumed his political activities in the labor movement. On the
    political spectrum, Mr. Okhovat Moqaddam had a leftist inclination. He
    founded a political organization called Kargaran-e Mobarez, which
    participated in the Vahdat conference as one of the Khat-e Se (Third Line)
    organizations. The Peykar Organization held his conference (which started
    in February 1979 and continued until the summer) in order to recruit other
    organizations. Kargaran-e Mobarez joined the Peykar Organization. Mr.
    Okhovat Moqaddam, a new member of the Organization, continued his
    political activity in the labor movement, namely political analysis and
    organizing sympathizers of this Organization in factories. Mr. Hossein
    Okhovat Moqaddam enjoyed hiking and he was a member of the Society of
    Mountain Climbing of Tehran. He was married and had a daughter who was
    born in prison. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working
    Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state,
    believed that China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and
    radically opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal
    repression of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within
    Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and
    scattered its supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in
    existence. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s
    arrest and detention are not known. According to the interviewee, in order
    to find Mr. Okhovat Moqaddam, the authorities had taken his father as
    hostage and kept him in solitary confinement in Section 209 of Evin
    prison. His mother was also arrested and imprisoned in Evin for months.
    Then the location of his house (in Shahbaz neighborhood in Tehran city)
    was disclosed and he and his pregnant wife were arrested. According to
    Peykargar , the arrest took place in late November 1982. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Mr. Okhovat Moqaddam
    was denied the right to have an attorney or even access to his file,
    throughout the interrogation and trial. Charges The charge brought against
    Mr. Okhovat Moqaddam is not known. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Okhovat
    Moqaddam s defense. Judgment Mr. Hossein Okhovat Moqaddam was executed by
    a firing squad in Tehran February 20, 1983. His body was not returned to
    his family. He was buried in Khavaran cemetery.
