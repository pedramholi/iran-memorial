    The information about Mr. Ali Mehdizadeh Valujerdi is based on an
    interview with his wife. He was born in Tehran in 1945. He graduated from
    Tehran University in sociology and had a child. Before the Revolution, he
    was an active member of the Setareh Sorkh (Red Star) Organization and went
    to prison for seven and a half years. After the Revolution, he became a
    member of the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran (Rah-e Kargar).
    “Rah-e Kargar” or the “Revolutionary Workers’ Organization of Iran” was
    established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by
    individuals from various leftist groups who had rejected the idea of armed
    struggle and believed in political action. They introduced themselves as
    Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of
    the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh,
    in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini’s
    leadership. Arrest and detention According to his wife, Mr. Ali Mehdizadeh
    Valujerdi was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards in his house in Tehran
    in April of 1983. He used a pseudonym but, after three months, his true
    identity was disclosed. After his arrest, the Guards went to his house
    several times to find possible hiding places and even tore out the walls.
    The officials took money, gold, and all the valuables, and confiscated his
    car. He was first detained at the Joint Committee of District 10, and then
    at Evin prison. He had no visitation during his three months detention at
    the Committee. After he was identified at Evin, he had two visitations
    with his father and his brother. In each occasion, his feet were entirely
    covered with bandages. According to one of his cellmates, he was so
    severely tortured that he spent three months out of his seven months
    detention at Evin Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
