    The execution of Mr. Hossein Mir, along with four others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on November 6, 1983. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr.
    Mir was reportedly charged with large-scale drug dealing and distribution,
    collaboration with the armed hoodlums in the southeast of Iran,
    transporting opium from Jiroft to Kerman, Kahnuj, BandarAbbas and the
    cities in northern Iran. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Mir 's
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Hormozgan declared
    Mr. Mir a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out in
    public at dawn.
