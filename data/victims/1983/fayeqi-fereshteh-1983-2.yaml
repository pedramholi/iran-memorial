    Ms. Fayeqi and some of her friends played a key role in improving access
    to books, especially uncensored ones, in the city of Saqqez. She did this
    by helping establish a bookstore and providing financial and moral support
    to keep it running. The information regarding the execution of Ms.
    Fereshteh Fayeqi, daughter of Mohammad Fayeqi and Mina Fallahi, was
    obtained through interviews conducted by the Boroumand Center with an
    acquaintance of the family (on January 22, 2021, August 28, 2023, and
    March 11, 2024) and an interview with a former cellmate (on July 8, 2022).
    Additional information was gathered from ABC's previous research and
    documents, as well as two related reports on the Nemiran Foundation
    website (on January 21 and 24, 2021). Fereshteh Fayeqi was born on
    November 23, 1956, in Saqqez, a city in Kurdistan Province, the place
    where she graduated from high school. In 1971, after graduating from a
    teacher training college, she began working as a teacher in the villages
    around Saqqez as an employee of the Ministry of Education. After the
    revolution of 1979, she continued to teach at the Majedi Boys' Primary
    School in the same city. In 1976, she was accepted into the literature
    program at the Teacher Training College in Sanandaj to pursue a bachelor's
    degree. While studying in Sanandaj, she continued to teach in Saqqez (ABC
    interview with a family acquaintance, January 22, 2021; Nemiran
    Foundation, January 21, 2021). During this time, Fereshteh Fayeqi and some
    friends played a key role in making books, especially uncensored ones,
    more accessible in the city of Saqqez. They opened a bookstore and
    supported it both financially and morally by paying the monthly rent,
    selecting books, and transporting them from cities like Tabriz and Tehran
    to Kurdistan. (ABC interview with a family acquaintance, January 22, 2021)
    Fereshteh Fayeqi had a deep interest in reading books and often read
    selected pieces of the world and Iranian literature to her mother, who
    couldn't read Persian. According to a family member, "Many people were
    surprised at how well Fereshteh's mother knew the names of so many authors
    and was familiar with the content of some of their books. (Interview with
    a family acquaintance, January 22, 2021) Even while in prison, Fereshteh
    continued to encourage her friends and fellow inmates to read. (ABC
    interview with a former cellmate, July 8, 2022) In 1976 and 1977,
    Fereshteh Fayeqi was teaching in primary schools in villages around
    Saqqez, particularly in "Parsanian school", a faraway and hard-to-reach
    village where few teachers were willing to work. She was beloved by
    students, villagers, and even local religious clerics because of the
    special bond she formed with the community. Fereshteh had a particularly
    close relationship with the women, helping them improve their hygiene and
    health by providing them with necessary supplies. In addition to teaching,
    she also researched educational methods. "She was inspired by the
    innovative teaching techniques used by the nomads and encouraged her
    family members to learn calligraphy using their methods. Despite their
    limited resources, the nomads, who had no notebooks or pens, learned
    calligraphy using chalk and blackboards. (ABC interview with a family
    acquaintance, August 28, 2023) Fereshteh Fayeqi began her political
    activities by volunteering in villages and working with others to
    distribute books. Around the time of the 1979 revolution, she officially
    joined Peykar (Organization of the Struggle for the Emancipation of the
    Working Class). In 1980, she married Sarem-edin Eftekhari, a leader of the
    organization in Kurdistan, who was also executed in March 1982. (Interview
    with a family acquaintance by ABC, January 22, 2021) Fereshteh was the
    first woman from Saqqez to join the Peykar Organization. (Nemiran
    Foundation, January 24, 2021) In 1980, Fereshteh was dismissed from her
    position at the Ministry of Education due to her political activities.
    (Nemiran Foundation, January 21, 2021) According to a family friend,
    "Fereshteh's sense of human responsibility became a central part of her
    life from a very young age. Instead of playing typical childhood games,
    she felt responsible for meeting the expectations and needs of girls her
    age and neighborhood women, whether it was teaching them to read and write
    or helping them learn handicrafts. She put a lot of effort into these
    activities. (Nemiran Foundation, January 21, 2021) The Peykar Organization
    The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was
    founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
    The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle
    and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh
    Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state,
    believed that China had deviated
