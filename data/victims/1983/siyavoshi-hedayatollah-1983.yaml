    Information about the execution of Mr. Hedayatollah Siavoshi (also spelled
    " Hidayatu'llah Siavushi") , son of Forud, was obtained from a ruling by
    the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shiraz, confirmed by the Superior
    Judicial Court, published in Ettela at Newspaper (January 8, 1983) and
    Khabar Jonub Newspaper (January 5, 1983), as well as well as information
    published on Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran. Mr. Hedayatollah
    Siavoshi is also one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1993 report
    published by the Baha i International Community. The report documents the
    persecution of the members of the Baha i faith in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran and lists members killed since 1978. Additional information has been
    drawn from various issues of The Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XIX,
    1982-1986, Haifa 1994. Mr. Hedaytollah Siavoshi was born in Yazd, Yazd
    Province on June 5th, 1952 to a Baha i family (ABPI, Bio). He completed
    his elementary education in Yazd, prior to relocating to Shiraz with his
    family, where he obtained his high school diploma. After serving as an
    assistant to the Auxiliary Board, he was elected to the Local Spiritual
    Assembly of Shiraz in 1981. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the
    members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious
    minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(2)- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.(3) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the
    time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified
    and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Baha i National Spiritual Assembly After the
    Islamic Revolution In the organizational structure of the Baha i
    community, the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly is a body
    composed of nine individuals that are elected annually with the votes of
    adult Baha is in each country. This institution tends to the affairs and
    issues of the Baha i community on the national level. The National
    Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility of guiding, coordinating, and
    moving forward the activities of each country s local spiritual
    assemblies, and establishing contact with Beit-al-Adl ( House of Justice
    ), the international council of the Baha i faith, the highest
    decision-making authority in the world Baha i community. The Bah I s
    Spiritual Assemblies were gradually suppressed. In Baha I s literature,
    the first assemply whose members were kidnapped is commonly known as the
    First National Assembly. In 1980 and 1981, the First, Second, and Third
    National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as local Baha i spiritual
    assemblies in various cities, including Tehran, Yazd, Hamedan, and Tabriz,
    were severely persecuted and the majority of their members were executed.
    In The Final Message of the Iran National Spiritual Assembly to the
    Friends of the Country , the Third Baha i National Spiritual Assembly,
    abiding by the principle of obeying the government, announced the closure
    of the Baha i organizations, and at the same time, sent an open letter to
    two thousand well-known and high-ranking government figures asking an end
    to the arrest, detention, torture, execution, and injustice against Baha
    is. (BBC Persian website, October 11, 2015). Judicial officials of the
    Islamic Republic have come up with [unreasonable and unacceptable]
    justifications for the persecution and the execution of the members of the
    National Spiritual Assemblies. In a speech on May 28, 1982, Ayatollah
    Khomeini said: The Baha is are not a religion, they re a [political]
    party; it s a party that was supported by Britain in the past, and now it
    s being supported by America. They are spies. (Sahifeye Noor, Volume 17,
    May 28, 1982). The Baha is deny the charge of relations with countries suc
