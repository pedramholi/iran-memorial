    Changiz Ahmadi, a former Tehran University law student, went underground
    in the early 1970 s to oppose the Shah. Joining Rah-e Kargar came later in
    the same decade. Mr. Changiz Ahmadi is one of the 12,028 individuals
    listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No. 261), published by
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals affiliated with various opposition groups who were executed or
    killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June
    1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Additional information about
    Mr. Ahmadi is taken from the book Our Martyrs for Freedom and Socialism by
    Rah-e Kargar publications, 1988. He was born in Tabriz and was a law
    student in Tehran University. After a short detainment in 1971, he joined
    the underground struggle against the Shah s regime. In 1974, he was
    arrested and condemned to ten years imprisonment. After being released in
    1978, he joined the Rah-e Kargar Organization and became an advisor to the
    Organization s Central Committee. His wife, Khadijeh Arfa , was also a
    sympathizer of this organization and was executed, as well. Rah-e Kargar,
    or the Revolutionary Workers Organization of Iran, was established in the
    summer of 1979. The Organization was founded by individuals from various
    leftist groups who had rejected the idea of armed struggle and believed in
    political action. They introduced themselves as Marxist-Leninists,
    promoting a socialist revolution and the leadership of the proletariat.
    They differed with the pro-Soviet communist party, Tudeh, in that they
    opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini s leadership. Arrest
    and detention The details of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    unknown. According to the Rah-e Kargar book, Mr. Ahmadi was arrested in
    his home in Shiraz, along with his wife, in 1982. He was first taken to
    the Shiraz Prison and was then transferred to Evin Prison. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges No information
    is available on Mr. Ahmadi s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution contains no evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available about his defense. Judgment No specific
    information is available about the execution order. Mr. Changiz Ahmadi was
    executed by a firing squad at Evin Prison on August 31, 1983.
