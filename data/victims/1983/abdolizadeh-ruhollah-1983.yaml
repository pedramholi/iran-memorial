    The execution of Mr. Ruhollah Abdolizadeh Mehrabi, along with three
    others, was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on October 11, 1983.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Abdolizadeh Mehrabi was reportedly charged
    with drug dealing and distribution. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Abdolizadeh Mehrabi's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal
    of Hormozgan sentenced Mr. Abdolizadeh Mehrabi to death. Having been
    confirmed by the Islamic Revolution s Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out in public.
