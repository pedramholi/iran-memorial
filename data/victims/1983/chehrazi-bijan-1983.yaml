    The information pertaining to Mr. Bizhan Chehrazi’s case is provided
    through an interview with one of his relatives by Omid. Mr. Chehrazi was a
    father of two daughters. He started political activism at an early age. He
    was arrested in Esfahan (a province in Iran) at 13 for distributing
    pamphlets for Hezbeh Tudeh (the pro-soviet union Iranian political party).
    However, he was released due to his age. After finishing his high school
    diploma, he moved to Austria and studied economics. In Austria, he
    remained polically active with the Tudeh Party. He secretly returned to
    Iran with the help of the Party in 1968. In 1972 he was arrested and
    sentenced to ten years in prison. His release from prison was concurrent
    with Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. After the Revolution he continued his
    political work with the Komeleh Organization (an armed Kurdish leftist
    group who fought against the Islamic regime). Furthermore, Mr. Bijan
    Chehrazi (a lawyer and a member of the Komeleh Organization) is on a list
    of martyrs published by the Komeleh Organization. He is also one of the
    12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261),
    published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Arrest and detention
    Based on the information given in the interview, Mr. Chehrazi was arrested
    by the revolutionary guards when he was supposed to meet someone, in
    December 1980. The revolutionary guards were informed of this meeting
    prior to his arrest. He was detained at the Evin Prison in Tehran. He was
    denied a lawyer, and his mother’s efforts to secure visitation time with
    him were futile. There is no direct information regarding the details of
    his arrest, the interrogation, and his detention. What is known is through
    letters sent to his wife by a former prisoner. The letters state that:
    “Mr. Chehrazi would often shut his eyes when he was tortured in spite of
    the blindfold. When he was returned to his prison cell from the torture
    chamber for the first time and the blindfold was removed, he had to rub
    his eyes for a while before he could see his cell mate. Furthermore, he
    was very thin and weak and had difficulty walking. His teeth were crushed
    under torture, and he had a hard time eating. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available in
    regards to the charges brought against this defendant Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Chehrazi’s defense. Judgment Mr. Bijan Chehrazi was
    executed in August 1981. There is no further information about his
    execution. A section of his cell mate’s letter explains, “He had a strong
    and resilient spirit and knew that he was going to be executed. He asked
    me to give his wife, to whom he was very grateful, a poem by Nazem Hakmat
    (a Persian poet).” The poem states: my wife, the bee who is sweeter than
    honey, we have just started the fight. They cannot behead a human being as
    if he were a turnip... I will see you and my friends in the twilight of my
    last day, and alone I will take the bitterness of an unfinished song to
    the grave.
