    The execution of Mr. Hassan Zare, along with fifteen others, was announced
    in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s
    Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily
    on December 26, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to this communiqu ,
    Mr. Zare was charged with being actively involved in the supply and
    distribution of heroin, organizing a drug-trafficking gang, buying 5.30 kg
    of heroin from Zahedan and selling it over a period of time, transporting
    381 gm of heroin when arrested, being convicted of supplying and
    distributing heroin several times. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Zare s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Anti-Drug Campaign
    in Tehran sentenced Mr. Zare to death. Having been confirmed by the
    Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in Shurabad at dawn.
