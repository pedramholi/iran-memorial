    The information about Mr. Mehran Nakhostlotfi is based on an interview
    with a person close to him. He is also is among the 282 individuals listed
    in a United Nations Report on The Situation of Human Right in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran (Note by the Secretary General), published on 13 November
    1985. The report lists these individuals as “Persons who were allegedly
    summarily and arbitrarily executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    1984-1985.” He was born in Rasht, a high school graduate and a sympathizer
    of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization. During the Revolution, he was an
    activist and a member of the Revolutionary Committee in the Noqrehdasht
    Quarter of Rasht. Arrest and detention The details of Mr. Mehran
    Nakhostlotfi’s arrest and detention are not known. He was arrested in his
    house in Tehran in the summer of 1981. He was detained at Evin and
    Gohardasht prisons. For more than one year, his family had no information
    about his detention location. According to the interviewee, after a
    visitation with her son, his mother said: “My son was deformed because of
    severe torture and his head was swollen.” Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges No information is available on
    Mr. Nakhostlotfi’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available about Mr. Nakhostlotfi’s
    defense. Judgment No specific information is available about the execution
    sentence. Mr. Mehran Nakhostlotfi was executed at Gohardasht prison on
    January 7, 1983. A few months after his only visitation, the officials of
    Gohardasht called his parents and asked them to pick up their son’s
    belongings. According to the interviewee, “When most prisons were
    overpopulated, a Human Rights delegation was scheduled to visit the
    prisons. In order to reduce the number of prisoners, officials executed
    Mehran, along with 400 other prisoners. I met a person at Behesht-e Zahran
    cemetery who claimed that he witnessed the mass burial of victims.
    According to him, ‘They dug a huge area with a bulldozer and we counted
    400 bodies.’ They called this section of Behesht-eZahran ‘Kafarabad’ [a
    place for infidels].”
