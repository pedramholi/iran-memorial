    News of the execution of Mr. Vazgen Mansurian, son of Karabid, and of his
    will, was published by the Peykargar Student Union in the Peykargar
    publication, number 5, on August 10, 1984. He is also is one of the 430
    individuals whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr. Mansurian
    was born in Masjedsoleiman to a middle-class family in 1956. After
    completing high school, he went to Tehran to study at the Architecture
    Faculty in Tehran University. He was married and had a son. He also went
    to France and was active in the Ehya Student Organization in Paris. After
    the revolution, he returned to Iran and continued his political activities
    in the Peykar Organization. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a social
    imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention Mr.
    Mansurian was arrested on November 19, 1982. Mr. Mansurian was tortured a
    lot while in detention. There is no further information available on the
    details of his arrest or/ and detention. Trial No information is available
    on Mr, Mansurian's trial. Charges No information is available regarding
    the charges against Mr. Mansurian. The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic
    authorities have brought trumped-up charges, including drug trafficking,
    sexual, and other criminal offences, against their opponents (including
    political, civil society activists, as well as unionists and ethnic and
    religious minorities). Each year Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    and executed based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Mansurian. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Mansurian s defense. Judgment Mr. Mansurian was executed
    along with 50 other people by firing squad in Tehran on July 24, 1983. He
    addressed his child in his will, saying: You told me you did not want to
    be an orphan. I m so sorry that your wish would not come true and you lose
    your father in such an early age, when you re just a blossom Please don t
    cry for me and don t let anyone else cry either. Give my greetings to
    everyone.
