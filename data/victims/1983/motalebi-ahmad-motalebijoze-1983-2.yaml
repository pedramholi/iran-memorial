    Mr. Ahmad Joze motalebi is one of the 12,028 individuals listed in an
    addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Mr. Ahmad Motalebi is one of the 430 individuals
    whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for
    the Liberation of the Working Class published on the website of Andeesheh
    va Peykar. This list contains the names of those members of the
    organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the
    individuals on this list have been executed. He was single. Additional
    information about Mr. Joze motalebi was sent to the Boroumand Foundation
    via an electronic form by a person familiar with his case. According to
    this information, Mr. Joze motalebi, son of Rahim, was born in Zanjan in
    1962. He was an honor student with a high school diploma in physics and
    mathematics and had studied in France on a scholarship during the Pahlavi
    regime. He was a sympathizer of the Peykar Organization. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a Social imperialist state, believed that China
    had deviated from Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all
    factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of
    dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and
    1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters.
    By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to the electronic form, Mr. Joz matlabi was arrested on the road
    between Zanjan and Tabriz. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges No information is available on the charges
    against Mr. Joze motalebi. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    does not contain information regarding the evidence provided against the
    defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Joze motalebi s
    defense. Judgment According to the addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No
    261), Mr. Joze motalebi was executed by a firing squad in Zanjan on March
    19, 1983.
