    The news about the execution of Mr. Mohammad Baqer Amjadi, son of Ali, was
    sent to the Boroumand Foundation sent via an electronic form by a person
    informed about this case. According to this information, Mr. Amjadi was
    born in Borujerd in 1956. He was a high school graduate and worked as a
    teacher. He was a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. Mr.
    Amjadi’s execution was also reported in an addendum to the Mojahed
    magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The
    addendum includes 12,028 individuals, affiliated with various opposition
    groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with the Islamic
    Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication date of the
    magazine. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group
    inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin
    America, was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the
    Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization, which had
    renounced armed struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic
    and of the Soviet Union. Arrest and detention According to the information

    around noon in Pole Dokhtar. He was then transferred to Khorramabad’s
    Intelligence Office prison. During the eight months that Mr. Amjadi was in
    detention, he was able to visit his family about ten times. Trial No
    information is available on Mr. Amjadi’s trial. Charges According to the
    electronic form, Mr. Amjadi’s only charge was his membership in Fadaiyan
    Khalq Organization. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution
    did not provide any specific information on the evidence presented against
    the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Amjadi’s
    defense. According to the electronic form, he was denied the right to an
    attorney and was not even arraigned. Judgment According to the electronic
    form, Mr. Amjadi was executed on March 7, 1983 by a firing squad at the
    Falak Olaflak Prison in Khorramabad. The addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    confirms that he was executed in 1983 in Khorramabad by a firing squad.
