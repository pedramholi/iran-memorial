    The execution of Mr. Mahdi Ajrlu , along with fifteen others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on December 26, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to
    this communiqu , Mr. Ajrlu was charged with being actively involved in the
    supply and distribution of narcotics, organizing a drug-trafficking gang,
    dealing 56.5 kg of opium and 12.5 kg of heroin over a period of time,
    transporting 2.713 kg of opium when arrested, being convicted of supplying
    and distributing narcotics several times. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Ajrlu s
    defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Anti-Drug Campaign
    in Tehran sentenced Mr. Ajrlu to death. Having been confirmed by the
    Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in Shurabad at dawn.
