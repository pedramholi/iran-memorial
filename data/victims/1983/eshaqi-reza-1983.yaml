    The execution of Mr. Reza Eshaqi was announced by the Public Relations of
    the Justice Department in Khorasan and reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on October 26, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant’s trial. Charges Mr. Eshaqi was reportedly
    charged with “first-degree murder.” The validity of the criminal charges
    brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the
    basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations
    have drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic’s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Eshaqi’s defense. Judgment Mr. Eshaqi was sentenced to death. The sentence
    was confirmed by the Supreme Judicial Council. He was executed at dawn.
