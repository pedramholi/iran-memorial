    Mr. Hamid Reza Arast, son of Mansur, died when fire broke out in a prison
    in Rasht. Reports about the fire have been published on the Bidaran
    website (December 20, 2006), a book called Goodnight Comrade , prison
    memoirs of Mr. Ahmad Musavi (2005), as well as an article by Mr. Kaveh,
    posted on the Prison Dialogues website (2006). Additionally, Mr. Arast is
    one of the 12028 individuals listed in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine
    (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. Mr. Arast was
    born in Rasht in 1958. Having graduated from junior high school, he began
    working as an ironsmith. He was a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq
    Guerillas (Ashraf Dehqani Branch). The Fadayian Khalq Guerilla
    Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution
    and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by
    two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979
    revolution, the Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split
    over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. A
    number of the Organization s members, who did not renounce armed struggle,
    founded the group the Fadayian Khalq Guerillas (Ashraf Dehqani Branch).

    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Arast s defense. Judgment On Tuesday,
    March 15, 1983, fire broke out in the Gymnasium Prison in Rasht. Before
    the 1979 Revolution, the building was used as a gymnasium for navy
    officers. After the Revolution, the Revolutionary Guards confiscated the
    building and used it as a prison. At the time, there were about 57
    prisoners. The kerosene container of a heater in the guards room leaked
    and caused a fire. The fire quickly spread to the cells due to their
    wooden ceiling. Witnesses stated that the Revolutionary Guards went to the
    prison yard but did not open the door for prisoners, fearing that they
    would escape from prison. The guards even threatened the prisoners that if
    they tried to get out of the building they would be shot. Based on
    available information, navy officers asked the prison guards to open the
    door and offered help to watch over the prisoners. The guards refused. It
    was only after more Revolutionary Guards came to the location and
    surrounded the prison that they opened the doors to the cells. Seven
    prisoners lost their lives in the fire, one of whom was Mr. Arast. He was
    23 years old.
