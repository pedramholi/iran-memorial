    According to a report by a survivor of the incident published by the
    Bidaran website, a fire broke out in the Rasht Prison on March 15, 1983
    during the annual celebration of Charshanbehsuri. This place had been a
    club for navy officers during the previous regime and was confiscated by
    the Revolutionary Guards and transformed to a prison. It consisted of
    three rooms and a hallway with access to the Guards' room and the prayer
    room. At the time of the incident, about 57 prisoners were detained in
    this location. According to eyewitnesses, the Guards who were in the yard
    did not open the doors during the fire to prevent the possibility of any
    escape. They threatened to shoot the prisoners if they entered the yard.
    As a result of this irresponsibility by Guards and prison officials, seven
    prisoners died and several others were injured. According to the Peykar
    Andeesheh website, Mr. Mohammad Reza Sepehrinejad, a sympathizer of the
    Peykar Organization, was among the dead. Mr. Mohammad Reza Sepehrinejad is
    one of the 430 individuals whose names appear on the list of Martyrs of
    the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published
    on the website of Peykar Andeesheh. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. According to
    this report, Mr. Mohammad Reza Sepehrinejad was a student and a member of
    the national boxing team. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a "Social
    imperialist" state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges No
    information is available on Mohammad Reza Sepehrinejad s charges. Evidence
    of guilt The report of this execution does not contain information
    regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No
    information is available on Mr. Mohammad Reza Sepehrinejad's defense.
    Judgment According to a report by a survivor of the incident published by
    the Bidaran website, Mr. Mohammad Reza Sepehrinejad was killed during the
    fire in Rasht prison on March 15, 1983.
