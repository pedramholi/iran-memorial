    The execution of Mr. Hamid Kafafi, along with sixteen others, was
    announced in a communiqu from the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami Daily on October 8, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Kafafi was reportedly
    charged with participating in the purchase and distribution of narcotics,
    bringing heroin from Zahedan to sell it after being released from prison,
    and having been convicted previously several times. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Kafafi's
    defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal in
    Tehran declared Mr. Kafafi a corruptor on earth and sentenced him to
    death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out at 5 a.m.
