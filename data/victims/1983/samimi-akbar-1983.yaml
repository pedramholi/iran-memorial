    The information about Mr. Akbar Samimi is based on an interview with his
    brother. He was born in Shushtar in 1955 (Khuzestan province). He was a
    high school teacher and a sympathizer of the Fadaiyan Khalq Minority.
    Before the Revolution, he was arrested twice. First, in 1973 he was
    condemned to one year imprisonment in Dezful. The second time, in 1976, he
    was condemned to 4 years imprisonment for participation in a demonstration
    against the killing of nine political prisoners. After the Revolution he
    was released and joined the Fadaiyan Khalq Organization. He was in charge
    of the organization in Masjed Soleiman. Later he opposed the policy of the
    Organization toward the regime and left it. After a split in the
    Organization, he joined the Minority branch, which opposed the regime, and
    he was in charge of Khuzestan province. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist
    groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Revolution, the
    Organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over support of
    the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority
    opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly in the political arena
    and the labor movement. Arrest and detention Mr. Akbar Samimi was arrested
    while driving near Seyedkhandan Bridge (in Tehran) in the summer of 1982.
    Revolutionary Guards arrested him on the pretext that he was driving a
    stolen car. They took him first to the Joint Committee and then to Evin
    Prison, Section 209. He had only two visitations with his mother. The
    first visit took place six months after his arrest and the second one
    before his execution. He was detained for one year. According to the
    interviewee, Mr. Akbar Samimi was tortured severely. He quotes a cellmate:
    ″His interrogator was an aggressive and cruel person. He was tortured for
    11 consecutive days in order to force him to do a televised interview. The
    marks of torture were clearly evident on his arms and feet. ″ The
    interviewee quotes another cellmate as saying: ″They started torturing
    Akbar right away in order to get his information. He lost consciousness
    several times... In the first couple of days, four to five people
    interrogated him. After the primary interrogations, they sent him to Evin
    Prison, Section 209 for a new series of interrogations… One day I was
    being interrogated when they brought in Akbar. The interrogator told
    Akbar: 'Why don't you talk? I made more important people talk. We know
    everything. Do you still want to be silent?' Akbar replied, 'I don't have
    anything to add to what I already told you.' At this moment, the
    interrogator picked up a chair and hit Akbar in the head with it. Other
    interrogators, including mine, protested this action." Trial No detail of
    the trial is not known other than it took place at Evin prison in August,
    1983. Charges No information is available on Mr. Akbar Samimi's charges.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain

    According to the interviewee, the evidence against Mr. Akbar Samimi
    consisted of the statements by his friends which were extracted under
    torture. Defense No information is available about his defense. He was
    denied the right to have an attorney. Judgment No specific information is
    available about the verdict leading to this execution. According to the
    interviewee, Mr. Akbar Samimi was executed by a firing squad at Evin
    prison in August, 1983. During the visit with his mother before the
    execution, he told her: "I am condemned to death. Do not worry. Execution
    is like drinking tea!" The prison officials did not return his body or
    will to his family. After persistent inquiries by his family, the
    officials finally told them that he was buried in the Khavaran cemetery.
