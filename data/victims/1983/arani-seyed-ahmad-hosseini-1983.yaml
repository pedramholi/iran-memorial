    stated in his will, which was written moments prior to his execution: I
    write these words in the last moments of my life, and I can say that I am
    completely calm... I lived my life and at the end of my life, which
    perhaps could not have been longer, I m calm, happy and relaxed. The news
    and information about the execution of Mr. Seyed Ahmad Hosseini Arani, son
    of Ata and Seyed Abbas, along with 19 other individuals, was obtained
    through Abdorrahman Boroumand Center s interviews with his wife on June 22
    and 26, 2018 (ABC interview) and also the electronic form sent to ABC by
    Mr. Hosseini Arani s wife. Additional information in this regard was
    obtained from a report posted on the weblog I Don t Know on August 13,
    2013 by Mr. Shiva Farahmand, a close friend of Mr. Hosseini Arani, ABC s
    research, and documents available at ABC such as Mr. Hosseini Arani s
    will. Mr. Hosseini Arani is one of the individuals whose name and date of
    execution is published in Komala * s List of Martyrs. Mr. Hosseini Arani
    was born on June 10, 1951 to a very religious family in the city of Kashan
    and grew up in Tehran. Despite the religious restrictions in his family,
    Mr. Hosseini Arani was not a religious person. He graduated from high
    school at Alborz School and went to study mechanical engineering at
    Ariamehr (Sharif) University of Technology in 1969. After graduation, she
    started working at the Arak Automobile Factory and got married in 1978.
    Mr. Hosseini Arani resigned from his job after the Islamic Revolution due
    to his political activities and security issues. He was interested in
    foreign languages, translated some books from English, and also learned
    French on his own. According to his wife, Mr. Hosseini Arani was a very
    patient and diligent person who had a good relationship with others. His
    friend from university and years after graduation, Mr. Shiva Farahmand,
    describes him thus: Ahmad was extremely intelligent. He also had extensive
    knowledge of science, sociology, politics and arts. He was interested in
    Azerbaijani and classical music, and he loved art, literature and movies
    from the Soviet Union. ... Ahmad loved carpentering and was a skilled
    carpenter. He had made much of the furniture in his home himself. Mr.
    Hosseini Arani started political activities when he was in university and
    met a number of students at the University of Technology who were from a
    leftist tendency which had split with the Mojahedin Khalq Organization.
    After graduating in January/February 1974, he decided to study abroad. His
    study abroad did not last more than a year, and he returned to Iran. He
    then joined a group which had split from the Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    named Nabard Committee ** and continued his activities with them. During
    the years before the Islamic Revolution in Iran, he had minimal political
    activities. However, following the demonstrations and the holding of
    political campaigns and gatherings after the revolution, he resumed his
    activities. After the war between Iran and Iraq began, a part of the
    Razmandegan Organization united with the Komala Party and established the
    Razmandegan Faction, and Mr. Hosseini Arani joined the workers faction of
    Razmandgan , called Unity, Battle for the Liberation of the Working Class.
    *** Mr. Hosseini Arani was interested in foreign languages, Azerbaijani
    and classical music, and art, literature and movies from the Soviet Union.
    Arrest and detention On December 12, 1982, agents of the Joint Committee
    of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard arrested Mr. Hosseini Arani along with
    his wife at their home in Tehran. Around 5 PM, about six agents of the
    Joint Committee of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard entered their home,
    showing them an arrest warrant issued by the [Islamic Revolutionary]
    Committee on Enqelab Street, though their names did not appear on the
    warrant. After about three hours of searching their home and seizing
    property (including books, family photos, a tape recorder, and
    recordings), the agents transferred Mr. Hosseini Arani and his wife to the
    Joint Committee Prison (known as the Tohid Detention Center or Ward 3000),
    blindfolded and handcuffed. Mr. Hosseini Arani was tortured during
    detention. In a short meeting in presence of interrogators, his wife
    peeked from under the blindfold to see signs of torture by cable beating
    on both of Mr. Hosseini Arani s feet. In April/May 1983, Mr. Hosseini
    Arani and his wife were transferred to Evin Prison, and Mr. Hosseini Arani
    was held at Evin Prison until the implementation of the court order. Mr.
    Hosseini Arani s family, who were opposed to his beliefs and political
    views, never visited him during his detention. During his detention, Mr.
    Hosseini Arani had only two very brief, chance visits with his wife. On
    July 14, 1983, Mr. Hosseini Arani met his wife at Evin Prison for the last
    time. This meeting lasted five minutes, and they were not told that it
    would be their last. At this visitation, Mr. Hosseini Arani told his wife
    that his family had not
