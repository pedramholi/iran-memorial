    Ms. Sabet Sarvestani was a happy, intelligent, devoted, and selfless
    individual. In high school and college, she would spend time to make sure
    his fellow students were making progress in their academic studies. At
    work, she would work as a replacement for her colleagues who were on
    leave. News of the execution of Ms. Akhtar Sabet Sarvestani (also spelled
    " Thabit") , daughter of Hossein and Havva, and that of 9 other Baha i
    women was published in the Baha i News Monthly, run by the United States
    National Spiritual Assembly (June 18, 1983), Baha is Office of Public
    Relations (June 20, 1983), and the Times newspaper (June 21, 1983). She
    was one of the 206 individuals whose name was published in the Worldwide
    Baha i Community s 1999 report. This report, entitled The Baha i Question:
    Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community ,
    dealt with the persecution of members of the Baha i faith in Iran by the
    Islamic Republic, and contained a list of Baha is who were killed in Iran
    since 1979. Additional information was obtained from Khabar-e Jonoob
    newspaper (February 12, and February 22, 1983); The New York Times (May
    22, 1983); Sahifeye Imam ( The Imam s Book ), Volume 17 (May 28, 1983);
    Baha i World Almanac, Volume 18, 1979-1983 (Haifa, 1986); Shiraz Adelabad
    Prison s visitation card (1983); an account of events as published in A
    Tribute to the Faithful by Mah Mehr Golestaneh (1992); the book Olya s
    Story written by Olya Ruhizadegan, Andalib Magazine (Winter 1988); the
    Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran (undated); Morteza Esmailipur s
    YouTube Channel (January 26, 2016; June 15, and July 6, 2016); Martyrs of
    the Baha i Religion website (undated); Dar Gozar-e Tarikh ( Throughout
    History ) Telegram Channel (June18, 2019); and the Report of the United
    States Congressional Hearing published in the World Order Magazine (Winter
    1983-1984); Baha i Instruction website (June 12, 2017); Payam-e Haq
    website, the Baha i faith s messenger service, library, and information
    provider (21 July 2018). Ms. Sabet Sarvestani was born in 1958-59 in the
    town of Sarvestan in the south of Fars Province. She went to school in
    Sarvestan until 9th grade and subsequently moved to Shiraz where she
    obtained her high school diploma. Ms. Sabet Sarvestani was single and had
    an associate degree from Shiraz Nursing Education Center. In December
    1978, Sarvestan s Baha is were attacked by a group of Sarvestan residents,
    who had been instigated by revolutionary religious clerics to put pressure
    on Baha is to reject their faith. The Sabet Sarvestani family s home and
    business were set on fire and their possessions were pillaged. This attack
    caused Baha i families, including Ms. Sabet Sarvestani s, to move from
    Sarvestan to Shiraz. She spent her childhood in poverty; she also worked
    in the last two years of high school in order to make money and help out
    in the family s expenses. Ms. Sabet Sarvestani worked as a nurse at the
    children s wing of Sa di Hospital. She also taught ethics classes for Baha
    i children (Archives of Baha i Persecution in Iran; Iran Wire; Morteza
    Esmailipur s YouTube Channel, June 15, and July 6, 2016; Dar Gozar-e
    Tarikh ( Throughout History ) Telegram Channel; Payam-e Haq website; Baha
    i Instruction website). Ms. Sabet Sarvestani was a happy, intelligent,
    selfless, devoted, disciplined and committed person who lived a simple
    life. She was a woman with a strong personality and a rich social
    education. In high school and college, she would spend time to make sure
    her fellow students were making progress in their academic studies. She
    liked the nursing profession and she would work at the hospital as a
    replacement for her colleagues who were on leave. (Iran Wire; Morteza
    Esmailipur s YouTube Channel, July 6, 2016; Payam-e Haq website). Ms.
    Sabet Sarvestani s case is related to the issuance of a death sentence for
    22 Baha is, and the execution of 6 men and 10 women in June 1983 in
    Shiraz. Extensive international efforts were made in order to save the
    imprisoned Baha is. About a month prior to the implementation of the death
    sentences, then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan asked the Islamic Republic of
    Iran s authorities to stop the executions. A week after the American
    President s message, Ayatollah Khomeini, then-Leader of the Islamic
    Republic, addressing the U.S. government at a gathering of Iranian
    officials stated: We wouldn t have heard a peep out of you if these people
    were not spies. [You re speaking up now] because these are a bunch of
    people who are on your side and [protect] your interests And now [you] are
    making all this noise for 22 Baha is, who, they claim, have gotten
    entangled and been entrapped in Iran, and now all of a sudden [you] are
    humanitarians and are crying foul and pleading with the whole world to
    come to these people s rescue. [But] people know you [better] (The New
    York Times, May 22, 1983; Sahifeye Imam, Volume 17, May 28, 1983). The
