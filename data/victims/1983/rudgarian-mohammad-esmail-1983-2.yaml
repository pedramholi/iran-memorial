    The information about Mr. Mohammad Esma il Rudgarian, son of Taqi, is
    based on an interview and an email sent to Omid by a person familiar with
    this case. The email contained the report of the Nehzat newspaper on May
    2, 1985, regarding this death by torture while under custody. Without
    mentioning their name, the reporter quotes several officials who disclosed
    details about cause of death and their observation of Mr. Rudgarian s
    body. According to the information sent to Omid, Mr. Mohammad-Esma il
    Rudgarian was born in Amol in 1948. He had a bachelor s degree in physical
    education from Tehran University. He was popular among Amol residents and
    was a member of the Fadaiyan Khalq Guerilla Organization and its
    leadership in Mazandaran before the revolution. After the revolution, he
    moved to Tehran and went underground with pseudo name of Ahmad Tehrani. He
    was a member of the Fadaiyan Khalq Minority. His friends remember Mr.
    Rudgarian as an educated and persistent warrior who helped disadvantaged
    people. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a Marxist Leninist group inspired
    by the Cuban Revolution and the urban guerilla movements of Latin America,
    was founded in 1971 by two communist groups opposed to the Pahlavi regime.
    Following the 1979 revolution, the Organization had renounced armed
    struggle, split over their support of the Islamic Republic and of the
    Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and
    was active mainly in the political arena and the labor movement. Arrest
    and detention According to the information sent to Omid, Mr. Rudgarian was
    arrested by Revolutionary Guards at a rendezvous with a person in Tehran
    on August 8, 1982 around 6 a.m. and transferred to the Evin prison.
    According to the witness reports, he was tortured for three and a half
    months in Evin prison. He had no visitation and went on a hunger strike
    for two weeks. He was denied access to attorney. After Evin, he was
    transferred to a prison located at Hotel Casino, occupied by Revolutionary
    Guards at the time, in Amol. The news of this transfer was reported by a
    relative who accidentally saw him from a window. According to reports of
    some acquaintances from the prison, Mr. Rudgarian suffered severe torture
    and went on a dry hunger strike for 21 days resulting in stomach bleeding.
    According to the information sent to Omid, his family received reports
    from the prison indicating Mr. Rudgarian s inability to walk due to lashes
    resulted in his feet infection. After the family s many efforts and
    spending a substantial amount of money, Mr. Rudgarian finally was able to
    visit his mother in presence of Guards for two minutes in September of
    1982. According to the Nehzat newspaper, during this visitation, he told
    his mother After my death, be strong and lion-hearted. I did not give up
    any of my comrades to these executioners and you will be honorable. Trial
    No information is available on Mr. Rudgarian s trial. Charges No
    information is available on Mr. Rudgarian s charges. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against Mr. Rudgarian. Defense Mr. Rudgarian had no
    opportunity to defend himself. Judgment According to the information sent
    to Omid, Mr. Mohammad Esma il Rudgarian died in Amol prison due to
    injuries caused by torture on February 14, 1983. However, according to the
    Nehzat newspaper, in the evening of this day four Revolutionary Guards
    took the half-dead body of Mr. Rudgarian, who wore a dirty brown prison
    sandal on one foot, to the old hospital in Amol. After examination, the
    physician in charge announced that the patient was dead. Revolutionary
    Guards asked him to issue a dead certificate indicating the cause of death
    as being killed during a clash in forest. However, the physician rejected
    their request stating that there was no bullet wound and the victim was
    probably died due to internal and brain bleeding. Then, the Revolutionary
    Guards took the body hastily and buried it at a cemetery designated for
    political prisoners at a village called Emamzadeh Qasem near Amol at night
    and without informing the family. The Revolutionary Guards started a rumor
    in Amol that Mr. Rudgarian was killed during a clash in the forest.* Four
    days later, authorities informed the family by phone of his death and
    burial location. According to the existing information, Mr. Rudgarian s
    family officially complained and requested clarification of the
    circumstance of his death several days later. With the persistence of the
    family, authorities finally agreed to exhume and autopsy the body. This
    was done in the presence of officials, some coming from Tehran, and the
    family on March 1, 1983. According to the Nehzat newspaper and what the
    interviewee stated, quoting witnesses presented during the exhumation,
    after the identity of the body, that was buried standing with bloody
    clothes, was confirmed, it was taken to forensics for autopsy.
