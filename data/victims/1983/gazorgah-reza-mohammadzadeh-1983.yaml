    The information about Mr. Reza Mohammadzadeh Gazorgah is taken from the
    book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by the Tudeh Party
    Publications. He was born in Tehran in 1958. He started his political
    activism before the Revolution and helped organize demonstration.
    Consequently, he was imprisoned for some time. After the Revolution he
    went to study in France and Italy. As a biology major university student,
    he was a prominent activist of the Tudeh Party in Rome. After the
    Revolution, he returned to Iran. In 1980, following the party guidance, he
    entered the Basij and went to the frontline of the war. Later, he returned
    to Tehran and worked as a Revolutionary Guard. Soon afterwards he was
    called to be a guard of Khomeini’s residence in Jamaran (an area of
    Shemiran, a suburb of Tehran). His two brothers, Javad and Hassan, were
    executed during the mass killings of the political prisoners in 1988. They
    were also members of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created
    in 1941. The Tudeh Party ideology was Marxist- Leninist and it supported
    policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in
    Iran’s political scene until it was banned for the second time following
    the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party declared
    Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party’s leaders and members
    were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The details of his arrest and
    detention are not known. Mr. Reza Mohammadzadeh Gazorgah was arrested in
    his brother’s home in May, 1983. From the time of his arrest, he was kept
    incommunicado and under severe torture. Trial No information is available
    on the defendant’s trial. Charges According to the above book, Mr. Reza
    Mohammadzadeh Gazorgah was charged with “membership of the Tudeh Party”
    and “espionage”. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available about his defense. Judgment The exact cause of death is unknown.
    According to the book The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran , Mr. Reza
    Mohammadzadeh Gazorgah died under torture on May 29, 1983. The same book
    reports that his brother Javad heard in prison that Reza had been hanged.
    His family, upon receiving the body, said they observed evidence of rope
    burns around his neck and a hole in his foot. No information is available
    about any possible ruling against him.
