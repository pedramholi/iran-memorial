    Ms. Yolla Al-Hashim was one of 63 victims of the bombing of the American
    embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which took place on April 18, 1983. At
    approximately 1:05 PM, a truck loaded with nearly 2,000 pounds of
    explosives careened through the driveway of the American embassy and
    crashed into the building. A massive explosion ripped through all seven
    levels of the embassy, sending debris flying hundreds of feet into the air
    and causing the burning building to collapse on itself. In addition to
    those who lost their lives, at least 120 people were injured. At the time,
    it was the deadliest attack on an American diplomatic mission since World
    War II. Ms. Al-Hashim was born and raised in Beirut, Lebanon. She and her
    two sisters grew up in Ain el Remmaneh, a predominantly Christian
    neighborhood of East Beirut. After graduating from high school, she
    enrolled in a training program for administrative assistants. She was
    gifted with words and an excellent student in English, and this eventually
    won her employment at the American embassy, a position with which she was
    overjoyed. Mr. Abi-Najem, who knew Ms. Al-Hashim in high school,
    remembered her as being very honest, very friendly, and very outgoing,
    someone beautiful inside and outside. Another family member described her
    as a charming, smart, and very elegant girl. She knew good food when she
    saw it, and frequently asked her friend Jean to hand over his lunch-box
    since (in her opinion) his mother s cooking was better. In her spare time,
    Ms. Al-Hashim enjoyed reading, drawing, watching movies, and taking walks
    through Beirut with her friends. She was 21 or 22 at the time of her
    death. Background Ms. Al-Hashim is in Omid because of the overwhelming
    evidence connecting the Islamic Republic of Iran to the 1983 bombing at
    the American embassy in Beirut. This attack, claimed by a group called
    Islamic Jihad, was the first in a series of related bombings carried out
    in Lebanon between 1983 and 1984, which claimed at least 396 lives. In the
    early 1980s, Lebanon was a highly volatile country, home to conflicting
    military and political agendas and where the Islamic Republic exercised
    growing influence with the stated aim of spreading the Islamic Revolution.
    Already hostile to American influence in the Middle East and further
    angered by the United States military support of Iraq, Iran s foe in the
    Iran-Iraq war, the Islamic Republic s leaders became exasperated when,
    following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the summer of 1982, the
    United States brokered a Lebanese-Israeli truce and deployed a large
    contingent of American servicemen in the framework of a Multinational
    Peacekeeping Force. Islamic Jihad was a heretofore little-noticed group
    known only for a string of grenade attacks launched on French, Italian,
    and American members of the Multinational Force in March of 1983. When it
    claimed responsibility for the embassy bombing, Islamic Jihad declared
    that the attack was part of the Iranian revolution s campaign against
    imperialist targets throughout the world. The group promised that We shall
    keep striking at any imperialist presence in Lebanon, including the
    Multinational Force. (Two massive bomb attacks against American and French
    servicemen indeed followed on October 23, 1983). Islamic Jihad was a
    shadowy subset of Hezbollah (Party of God), a radical, armed Shi ite
    organization with deep ideological and organizational ties to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. As early as August of 1979, Iran s Supreme Leader,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, had alluded to the establishment of a Party of God
    that would unite Muslims around the goal of resisting American and Israeli
    designs for the Middle East. So far, the oppressed have been disunited and
    nothing happens through disunity. Now that an example of the unity of the
    downtrodden has materialized in the land of Muslims [the Islamic
    Revolution], this example will have to be applied in a wider context, to
    encompass all humanity, through the establishment of a Party of the
    Downtrodden, which is the same as the Party of God [ Hezbollah ], and
    which is in line with the exalted will of God Past mistakes must be
    rectified through Muslim unity and the establishment of the Party of the
    Downtrodden against the great powers, led by the criminal America and its
    very corrupt stooge, Israel. * Punishing those who supported Iraq in the
    Iran-Iraq war was another publicly discussed subject. The Islamic Republic
    s leaders were blunt about the potential consequences of the United States
    support for Iraq. As Khomeini stated in a speech of July 25, 1982, If we
    see that governments are giving financial and military assistance to the
    Iraqi government, we consider them guilty we will deal with them as we do
    with guilty people, and we will enforce the Islamic sentences concerning
    them. Ayatollah Khomeini repeatedly demonized the United States and
    expressed concern about its influence in the Muslim world. He emphasized
    that Muslims had a duty to rise up against autocratic l
