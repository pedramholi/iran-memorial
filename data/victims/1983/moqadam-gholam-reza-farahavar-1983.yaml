    The execution of Mr. Gholam Reza Farahavar Moqadam, along with fifteen
    others, was announced in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the
    Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the
    Jomhuri Eslami daily on December 26, 1983. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges
    According to this communiqu , Mr. Farahavar Moqadam was charged with being
    actively involved in the supply and distribution of narcotics, organizing
    a drug-trafficking gang, dealing 56.5 kg of opium and 12.5 kg of heroin
    over a period of time, transporting 2.713 kg of opium when arrested, being
    convicted of supplying and distributing narcotics several times. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Farahavar Moqadam s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Anti-Drug Campaign in Tehran sentenced Mr.
    Farahavar Moqadam to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court,
    the sentence was carried out in Shurabad at dawn.
