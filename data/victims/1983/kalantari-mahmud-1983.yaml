    The execution of Mr. Mahmud Kalantari, along with 19 others, was announced
    in a communiqu from the public relations office of the Islamic Revolution
    s Public Prosecutor s Office in Sistan and Baluchestan. The communiqu was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami Daily on October 25, 1983. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Kalantari was reportedly charged with continuous collaboration
    with Haji Bahador and Mohammad Jalalian and repeatedly participating in
    the transportation of opium and heroin. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Kalantari's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sistan
    and Baluchestan sentenced Mr. Kalantari to death. Having been confirmed by
    the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in the Islamic
    Revolutionary Committee at 1 a.m.
