    The execution of Mr. Abbas Shahaee, along with sixteen others, was
    announced by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office
    in Tehran and reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on September 21, 1983.
    Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and
    detention are not known. Trial No information is available on the
    defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Shahaee was reportedly charged with being
    actively involved in the production and distribution of narcotics,
    establishment of an international drug trafficking gang with another
    defendant, confessing to buying 7 kg of opium at 4 different times,
    establishment of an opium den, possessing 18. 952 kg of opium and 3 kg of
    heroin when arrested and having a criminal record. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Shahaee
    s defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s
    Office in Tehran sentenced Mr. Shahaee to death. The sentence was carried
    out in Qasr Prison.
