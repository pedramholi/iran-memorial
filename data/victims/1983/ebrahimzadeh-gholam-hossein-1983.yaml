    Mr. Gholam Hossein Ebrahimzadeh is one of the 12028 individuals listed in
    an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. Additional information about Mr.
    Ebrahimzadeh has been drawn from the book Our Martyrs for Freedom and
    Socialism by Rah-e Kargar publications, 1988, as well as an interview with
    an individual familiar with the case. Mr. Ebrahimzadeh was born in the
    city of Kangavar (Kermanshah province). He graduated from Shiraz
    University as a medical doctor. In 1967-68, he was a student activist in
    Shiraz. In 1970, he co-founded the Setareh Sorkh (Red Star) group, which
    used armed struggle in fighting the regime. In 1971, he was arrested and
    condemned to 11 years imprisonment. During his last years in prison, he no
    longer believed in armed struggle; and after his release in 1978, he
    became a co-founder of the Rah-e Kargar Organization and a member of its
    Central Committee. Rah-e Kargar or the Revolutionary Workers Organization
    of Iran was established in the summer of 1979. The Organization was
    founded by individuals from various leftist groups who had rejected the
    idea of armed struggle and believed in political action. They introduced
    themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist revolution and the
    leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the pro-Soviet communist
    party, Tudeh, in that they opposed the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah
    Khomeini s leadership. Arrest and detention According to the Rah-e Kargar
    book, The house where [Mr. Gholam Hossein Ebrahimzadeh] and Ali Reza
    Shokuki, was attacked by the Revolutionary Guards on June 28, 1983. Both
