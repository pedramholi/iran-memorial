    Mr. Kenneth E. Haas was one of 63 victims of the bombing of the American
    Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which took place on April 18, 1983. At
    approximately 1:05 PM, a truck loaded with nearly 2,000 pounds of
    explosives careened through the driveway of the American embassy and
    crashed into the building. A massive explosion ripped through all seven
    levels of the embassy, sending debris flying hundreds of feet into the air
    and causing the burning building to collapse on itself. In addition to
    those who lost their lives, at least 120 people were injured. At the time,
    it was the deadliest attack on an American diplomatic mission since World
    War II. Mr. Haas born on June 17, 1944 in Akron, Ohio. He was an
    outstanding athlete and an exemplary student. He graduated college with
    high honors and obtained a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Syracuse University in
    just two years. A few years after obtaining his Ph.D., Mr. Haas took up
    employment at the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. He served in a number
    of sensitive locations, including Bangladesh, Iran, and Oman. He was then
    appointed CIA Station Chief in Beirut, arriving there in mid-summer of
    1982. Mr. Haas was remembered by his family as a loving, sensitive, and
    inquisitive man. His father recalled that he loved the challenge of moving
    to new places, and understanding local cultures and customs. Mr. Haas and
    his second wife were newly married, and, as she recalled, very much in
    love. She brought him lunch every day at the American Embassy. On the day
    of the bombing, the two had lunch in his office as usual. Mr. Haas, who
    hoped to go home early, decided to stay to attend to some leftover work.
    The bomb detonated shortly after they parted ways. Mr. Haas was 38 years
    old at the time of his death. Background Mr. Haas is in Omid because of
    the overwhelming evidence connecting the Islamic Republic of Iran to the
    1983 bombing at the American embassy in Beirut. This attack, claimed by a
    group called Islamic Jihad, was the first in a series of related bombings
    carried out in Lebanon between 1983 and 1984, which claimed at least 396
    lives. In the early 1980s, Lebanon was a highly volatile country, home to
    conflicting military and political agendas and where the Islamic Republic
    exercised growing influence with the stated aim of spreading the Islamic
    Revolution. Already hostile to American influence in the Middle East and
    further angered by the United States military support of Iraq, Iran s foe
    in the Iran-Iraq war, the Islamic Republic s leaders became exasperated
    when, following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the summer of 1982, the
    United States brokered a Lebanese-Israeli truce and deployed a large
    contingent of American servicemen in the framework of a Multinational
    Peacekeeping Force. Islamic Jihad was a heretofore little-noticed group
    known only for a string of grenade attacks launched on French, Italian,
    and American members of the Multinational Force in March of 1983. When it
    claimed responsibility for the embassy bombing, Islamic Jihad declared
    that the attack was part of the Iranian revolution s campaign against
    imperialist targets throughout the world. The group promised that We shall
    keep striking at any imperialist presence in Lebanon, including the
    Multinational Force. (Two massive bomb attacks against American and French
    servicemen indeed followed on October 23, 1983). Islamic Jihad was a
    shadowy subset of Hezbollah (Party of God), a radical, armed Shi ite
    organization with deep ideological and organizational ties to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. As early as August of 1979, Iran s Supreme Leader,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, had alluded to the establishment of a Party of God
    that would unite Muslims around the goal of resisting American and Israeli
    designs for the Middle East. So far, the oppressed have been disunited and
    nothing happens through disunity. Now that an example of the unity of the
    downtrodden has materialized in the land of Muslims [the Islamic
    Revolution], this example will have to be applied in a wider context, to
    encompass all humanity, through the establishment of a Party of the
    Downtrodden, which is the same as the Party of God [ Hezbollah ], and
    which is in line with the exalted will of God Past mistakes must be
    rectified through Muslim unity and the establishment of the Party of the
    Downtrodden against the great powers, led by the criminal America and its
    very corrupt stooge, Israel. * Punishing those who supported Iraq in the
    Iran-Iraq war was another publicly discussed subject. The Islamic Republic
    s leaders were blunt about the potential consequences of the United States
    support for Iraq. As Khomeini stated in a speech of July 25, 1982, If we
    see that governments are giving financial and military assistance to the
    Iraqi government, we consider them guilty we will deal with them as we do
    with guilty people, and we will enforce the Islamic sentences concerning
    them. Ayatollah Khomeini repeatedly demonized the United States and
    expressed concern about
