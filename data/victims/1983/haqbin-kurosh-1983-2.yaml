    Mr. Haqbin attended meetings of the Baha i s Spiritual Assembly in
    Marvdasht. He had worked as a radio and t.v. technician there for years.
    Mr. Kurosh (also spelled "Kurush") Haqbin, a television and radio
    technician, a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Baha'is in
    Marvdasht and an Assistant to the Auxiliary Board member, is one of the
    206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report, Iran s Secret Blueprint for the
    Destruction of a Religious Community , documents the persecutions of the
    members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is
    killed since 1978. Additional information was drawn from the newspaper
    Khabar-e Jonub , published in Shiraz (22 February 1983), and from various
    issues of the The Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XVIII, 1979-1983,
    Haifa 1986 or description of events as published in A Tribute to the
    Faithful by Mah Mihr Gulistanih, or Olya's Story by Olya Roohizadegan. The
    Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the
    Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious
    community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300
    thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution,
    depriving them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion
    is not recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and
    Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have
    been denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority;
    they cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention Mr. Haqbin was arrested on
    8 December 1982 and taken to the Sepah [Revolutionary Guards] Detention
    Centre in Marvasht for five days before his transfer to the Sepah
    Detention Centre in Shiraz. He was kept there in solitary confinement for
    25 days prior to his transfer to Adelabad Prison. According to reports by
    his family visitors and former cellmates, he was repeatedly interrogated,
    tortured, and told to recant his faith and become a Muslim. Because of his
    religious beliefs, the prison authorities considered him to be an
    unbeliever, and thus "unclean", and he was subjected to humiliating
    treatment similar to that of atheist political prisoners. Prison wardens
    refused to have any physical contact with the prisoner even when, for
    example, they were guiding the blindfolded prisoner to the interrogation
    room. In such case guards would give him the end of a folded newspaper and
    hold the other end, avoiding contact. He remained in custody at Adelabad
    Prison until his execution. Trial Iranian authorities provided no
    information to Mr. Haqbin s family regarding his trial. However, according
    to reports by the the Baha i World , authorities informed the defendant
    that he would be subjected to four sessions in which he would be given the
    opportunity to recant his faith and accept Islam. He was informed that if
    he did not sign a prepared statement rejecting Baha ism, he would be
    killed. It is unclear if all these sessions took place and whether or not
    these sessions replaced a trial. Charges The text of the indictment was
    not provided to Mr Haqbin s family. However, according to statements by
    the Religious Judge and Head of the Revolutionary Court in Shiraz, the
    defendant's charges were related to his religious beliefs and activities.
    During his detention, the defendant was repeatedly asked to recant his
    faith. His last guidance session took place on 14 June 1983, where once
    again he stated he was a Baha'i (A Tribute to the Faithful, p. 144). In an
    interview published in the Newspaper Khabar-e Jonub the religious judge,
    Head of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz, in charge of the
    case, warned the Baha is to embrace dear Islam and recant Baha ism, which
    is rationally and logically doomed, before it is too late . The judge also
    discussed at length the charges and the alleged crimes committed by the
    defendants and
