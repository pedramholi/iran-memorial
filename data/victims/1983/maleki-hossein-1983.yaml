    Mr. Hossein Maleki is one of 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin Khalq Organization
    (MKO) on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. The information about Mr. Hossein Maleki was taken
    from the website of the MKO. He was born in Astaneh Ashrafieh (Gilan
    province). He was a high school teacher with a bachelor’s degree in
    Biology from Tehran University. After the Revolution, he joined the MKO in
    Lahijan and was transferred to Astaneh. According to the above source,
    when he was teaching in Astaneh, he was exiled to Rezvanshahr for his
    beliefs. After June 20, 1981, he went underground. The demonstration of
    June 20, 1981, took place in protest against the parliament’s impeachment
    of President Banisadr and the Islamic Republic’s systematic policy of
    excluding the MKO from the country’s political scene, the refusal of
    Ayatollah Khomeini to meet with MKO leaders and his insistence to disarm
    them. Until that day, the MKO had supported the leadership of Ayatollah
    Khomeini and agreed to operate within the framework of the new political
    system. However, on June 20, 1981, the MKO officially changed its policy
    and tried to overthrow the regime by organizing mass demonstrations all
    over the country. These demonstrations, which were severely suppressed and
    resulted in the killing of dozens of demonstrators, were followed by a
    wave of mass arrests and executions by both the Revolutionary Guards and
    para-military forces. These groups targeted all opposition groups. The
    massive repression, unprecedented in the history of the Islamic Republic,
    legitimized the months-old state policy of harassment and suppression of
    dissidents and resulted in the banning of all forms of independent
    political dissent. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Maleki was arrested in
    the spring of 1982. He was detained at the Revolutionary Guards prison in
    Astaneh Ashrafieh and Lahijan. According to the MKO website, he was
    severely tortured and kept in solitary confinement during the eight months
    of his detention. Trial No information is available on the defendant’s
    trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Hossein Maleki’s
    charges. According to the above source, before his arrest, a Revolutionary
    Guard commander was killed by an MKO Unit. Guards found a Kalashnikov gun
    where Mr. Hossein Maleki was arrested, and he accepted the responsibility
    for the weapon. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available about his defense. Judgment No specific information is available
    about the defendant’s execution. According to the above source, government
    agents delivered the body of Mr. Hossein Maleki to the morgue in Lahijan
    on January 29, 1983. His family took possession of his corpse and, during
    the funeral, they showed his tortured body to the attendees. According to
    the same source, he had died under torture.
