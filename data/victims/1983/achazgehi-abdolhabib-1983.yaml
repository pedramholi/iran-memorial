circumstances: >
    The execution of Mr. Abdolhabib Achazgehi, along with 10 others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the public relations of the Islamic Revolution
    s Public Prosecutor s Office in Sistan and Baluchestan. The communiqu was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on October 1, 1983. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Achazgehi was reportedly charged with importing 5 kg of
    hashish and being actively involved in drug trafficking. The validity of
    the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained
    in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International
    human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that
    the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Achazgehi's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Sistan
    and Baluchestan sentenced Mr. Achazgehi to death. Having been confirmed by
    the Supreme Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out in public in
    the Addicts Rehabilitation Center.
