    The execution of Mr. Hassan Lavasani, along with eight others, was
    reported in the Jomhuri Eslami Daily on October 31, 1983. Arrest and
    detention The circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are
    not known. Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial.
    Charges Mr. Lavasani was reportedly charged with drug dealing before and
    after the revolution, buying 3 kg of heroin and beating innocent people
    while using foul language before the victory of the revolution. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Lavasani defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Mashad sentenced Mr. Lavasani to death. Having been confirmed
    by the Islamic Revolution s Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out.
