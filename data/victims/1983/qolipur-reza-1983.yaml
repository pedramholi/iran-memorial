    The execution of Mr. Reza Qolipur was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami daily
    on August 24, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Qolipur was reported to be
    charged with transporting and storing 22.5 kg of opium, supplying
    narcotics from Sarakhs and distributing it in the provinces of northern
    Khorasan. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this
    defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of
    a fair trial. International human rights organizations have drawn
    attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities
    have brought trumped up charges against their political opponents and
    executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences.
    Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death
    following judicial processes that fail to meet international standards.
    The exact number of people convicted based on trumped-up charges is
    unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    No information is available on Mr. Qolipur's defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Quchan declared Reza Qolipur a corruptor on
    earth and sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by the Islamic
    Revolution s Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out in Quchan two
    nights ago.
