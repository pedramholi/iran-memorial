    The execution of Mr. Abdollah Barand Latif, along with fifteen others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on December 26, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to
    this communiqu , Mr. Barand Latif was charged with being actively involved
    in the supply and distribution of heroin, transporting 19 gm of heroin
    when arrested, being in drug business: supplying and distributing heroin
    for 9 years, supplying and distributing packages containing 50 gm or 100
    gm of heroin over a period of time, selling 1 kg of heroin once and being
    convicted of supplying and distributing heroin several times. The validity
    of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Barand Latif s defense. Judgment The Islamic
    Revolutionary Tribunal of Anti-Drug Campaign in Tehran sentenced Mr.
    Barand Laif to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the
    sentence was carried out in Shurabad at dawn.
