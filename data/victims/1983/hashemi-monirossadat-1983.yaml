    the Association of Iranian Women of K ln (Germany). The list published in
    1997 is entitled: "A partial list of names of women executed by the
    Islamic Republic of Iran." Additional information was taken from an

    form was also sent to the Omid. According to this information, she was a
    sympathizer of the Sahand Organization (Ettehad-e Mobarezan-e Komonist).
    Also, some information was taken from the website of the Communist Party

    to this website, Ms. Hashemi was born in 1954. She began her political
    activities by joining a guerilla group after entering the university in

    became a member in 1980. She was active in the Worker Section of this
    organization and became in charge of the Workers Section of South Tehran.
    The Sahand Organization (or Ettehad-e Mobarezan-e Komonist) was founded
    after the Islamic Revolution of February 1979, with a specific focus on
    ideology. After Sahand developed the project of the Communist Party of
    Iran in 1982, the Party was founded by Sahand and Komala and remainders of
    such Communist organizations as Peykar, Razmandegan, and some affiliates
    of the Fadaiyan Khalq. Later on, this party was divided into various
    factions. Arrest and detention Ms. Monirolsadat Hashemi was arrested in
