    The information about Mr. Gholamhossein Qena'ati is taken from the book
    Tudeh Martyrs , copyright 2001 by the Tudeh Party of Iran Publications. He
    was born in Kazerun. He was an agricultural engineer having graduated from
    Shiraz University. He joined the Tudeh Party in 1978 and was active in its
    underground organization. The Tudeh Party of Iran was created in 1941. The
    Tudeh's ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it supported policies of the
    former Soviet Union. The Party played a major role in Iran's political
    scene until it was banned for the second time following the August 19,
    1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Tudeh declared Ayatollah
    Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime revolutionaries and
    anti-imperialists and actively supported the new government. Although the
    Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it became the target of
    government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party's leaders and members
    were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this defendant
    s arrest and detention are not known. Mr. Qena'ati was arrested on April
    27, 1983. According to the book, he was denied visitation with his family
    and was only allowed to talk to them for a few minutes on the phone a
    couple of times while in detention. The last time he talked to his family
    was after the officials asked and received a 100 thousand Toman bribe from
    his family. Two days later, the prison officials called and informed his
    family that "he committed suicide by using the bathroom mirror". After
    repeated visits and inquiries from his family, the officials stated: "he
    did not cooperate." Trial No information is available on the defendant s
    trial. Charges No information is available on Mr. Qena'ati s charges.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution contains no evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defence No information is available about
    the defendant s defence. Judgment Based on the information available in
    the book, Mr. Qena'ati died under torture on November 22, 1983. No
    information is available about a ruling against him. According to the same
    source, the officials did not deliver his tortured body to his family, and
    refused to point out his burial location for a year. They threatened the
    family that since their son was an "infidel", they were not allowed to
    have a memorial ceremony.
