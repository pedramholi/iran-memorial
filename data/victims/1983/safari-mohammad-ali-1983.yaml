    The execution of Mr. Mohammad Ali Safari was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on January 9, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Safari was reported to
    be charged with adultery. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Each year, Iranian authorities sentence to death
    hundreds of alleged common criminals, following judicial processes that
    fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people convicted
    based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of
    this execution does not contain information regarding the evidence
    provided against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Safari's defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Eastern
    Fars sentenced Mr. Safari to death. Having been confirmed by the High
    Judicial Council, the sentence was carried out at dawn.
