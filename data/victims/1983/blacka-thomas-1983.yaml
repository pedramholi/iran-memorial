    Mr. Thomas Blacka was one of 63 victims of the bombing of the American
    Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which took place on April 18, 1983. At
    approximately 1:05 PM, a truck loaded with nearly 2,000 pounds of
    explosives careened through the driveway of the American embassy and
    crashed into the building. A massive explosion ripped through all seven
    levels of the embassy, sending debris flying hundreds of feet into the air
    and causing the burning building to collapse on itself. In addition to
    those who lost their lives, at least 120 people were injured. At the time,
    it was the deadliest attack on an American diplomatic mission since World
    War II. Mr. Blacka was born December 8, 1923 in Connellsville,
    Pennsylvania. A graduate of the University of Miami and the University of
    Denver, Mr. Blacka served in the U.S. military in England during World War
    II, where he met his wife. He joined the U.S. Agency for International
    Development (USAID) and was posted in numerous locations around the world.
    In every place he lived, he found creative ways to make his two children
    happy surprising them with grand, candlelit dinners in Pakistan; hanging a
    makeshift swing (a parachute) in their garden in Cyprus; taking them
    scuba-diving in Thailand. Mr. Blacka, who had retired from USAID in
    Thailand, temporarily stepped out of retirement in 1982 to accept a
    contract position at the American Embassy in Beirut. He arrived there in
    January of 1983. A foreign service officer who had previously met Mr.
    Blacka and was reunited with him in Beirut said that Mr. Blacka was
    overjoyed to be back at work. I remember one night we were having a beer
    at the Marine bar, and he was just beside himself, this foreign service
    officer recalled. He was really, really happy to be in Lebanon doing
    something useful. Mr. Blacka was 59 at the time of his death. Background
    Mr.Thomas Blacka is in Omid because of the overwhelming evidence
    connecting the Islamic Republic of Iran to the 1983 bombing at the
    American embassy in Beirut. This attack, claimed by a group called Islamic
    Jihad, was the first in a series of related bombings carried out in
    Lebanon between 1983 and 1984, which claimed at least 396 lives. In the
    early 1980s, Lebanon was a highly volatile country, home to conflicting
    military and political agendas and where the Islamic Republic exercised
    growing influence with the stated aim of spreading the Islamic Revolution.
    Already hostile to American influence in the Middle East and further
    angered by the United States military support of Iraq, Iran s foe in the
    Iran-Iraq war, the Islamic Republic s leaders became exasperated when,
    following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the summer of 1982, the
    United States brokered a Lebanese-Israeli truce and deployed a large
    contingent of American servicemen in the framework of a Multinational
    Peacekeeping Force. Islamic Jihad was a heretofore little-noticed group
    known only for a string of grenade attacks launched on French, Italian,
    and American members of the Multinational Force in March of 1983. When it
    claimed responsibility for the embassy bombing, Islamic Jihad declared
    that the attack was part of the Iranian revolution s campaign against
    imperialist targets throughout the world. The group promised that We shall
    keep striking at any imperialist presence in Lebanon, including the
    Multinational Force. (Two massive bomb attacks against American and French
    servicemen indeed followed on October 23, 1983). Islamic Jihad was a
    shadowy subset of Hezbollah (Party of God), a radical, armed Shi ite
    organization with deep ideological and organizational ties to the Islamic
    Republic of Iran. As early as August of 1979, Iran s Supreme Leader,
    Ayatollah Khomeini, had alluded to the establishment of a Party of God
    that would unite Muslims around the goal of resisting American and Israeli
    designs for the Middle East. So far, the oppressed have been disunited and
    nothing happens through disunity. Now that an example of the unity of the
    downtrodden has materialized in the land of Muslims [the Islamic
    Revolution], this example will have to be applied in a wider context, to
    encompass all humanity, through the establishment of a Party of the
    Downtrodden, which is the same as the Party of God [ Hezbollah ], and
    which is in line with the exalted will of God Past mistakes must be
    rectified through Muslim unity and the establishment of the Party of the
    Downtrodden against the great powers, led by the criminal America and its
    very corrupt stooge, Israel. * Punishing those who supported Iraq in the
    Iran-Iraq war was another publicly discussed subject. The Islamic Republic
    s leaders were blunt about the potential consequences of the United States
    support for Iraq. As Khomeini stated in a speech of July 25, 1982, If we
    see that governments are giving financial and military assistance to the
    Iraqi government, we consider them guilty we will deal with them as we do
    with guilty people, and we will enforce the Islamic sentences concerning
    them
