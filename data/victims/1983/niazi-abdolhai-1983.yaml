    The execution of Mr. Abdolahi Niazi, along with fifteen others, was
    announced in a communiqu by the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami daily on December 26, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to
    this communiqu , Mr. Niazi was charged with being actively involved in
    supplying and distributing heroin, organizing a drug-trafficking gang,
    collaboration with the gang of Ali Oruji Kasmaee, dealing 22.50 kg of
    narcotics over a period of time, transporting 6.438 kg of heroin when
    arrested, being convicted of supplying and distributing narcotics several
    times. The validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant
    cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair
    trial. International human rights organizations have drawn attention to
    reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought
    trumped up charges against their political opponents and executed them for
    drug trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of
    alleged drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial
    processes that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of
    people convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt
    The report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Niazi s defense. Judgment The Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Anti-Drug Campaign in Tehran sentenced Mr. Niazi to death.
    Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was carried out
    in Shurabad at dawn.
