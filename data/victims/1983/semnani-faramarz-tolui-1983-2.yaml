    Before the Revolution, he made radical radio outside the country for
    broadcast within. His advanced degree was earned in California, ahead of
    an activist return to Tehran. The execution of Mr. Tolu i Semnani, along
    with 21 others, was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, which
    published the official communiqu of the public relations of the Islamic
    Revolution s Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran on January 27, 1983. The
    information about his charges and defense was published in the same
    newspaper on January 10, 1983. Additional information from this case was
    gathered through interviews (April 18, 2006 and June 2, 2006) with persons
    familiar with Mr. Tolu i Semnani s case, who have asked to remain
    anonymous. Mr. Tolu i Semnani, a father of two, had obtained a masters
    degree from University of California, Berkley in electrical engineering.
    During his college years, he became involved with the political
    organization, Ettehadieh Komonist-ha (The Union of Communists of Iran). He
    excelled in his studies (writing an article for the scientific journal
    Electrical ) and was known to be a talented political recruiter. Mr. Tolu
    i Semanani was an active member of the Ettehadieh and spent time in the
    early 1970s in the Middle East preparing radio programs that were
    broadcast in Iran. In the fall of 1978, he returned to Iran with his wife
    and continued to dedicate himself to full-time political activism. The
    Ettehadieh Komonist-ha was created by exiled opponents of the Pahlavi
    regime who mostly belonged to the Student Confederation. They followed the
    teachings of Mao Tse-Tung and did not believe in guerilla warfare. The
    group became marked by ideological divides during the periods preceding
    and following the 1979 revolution which caused it to split into several
    factions. One of the most important rifts was triggered by the decision by
    a number of members to take up arms and take over a city in Iran. The
    uprising plan, devised in the midst of an active and violent
    anti-communist campaign by the revolutionary Islamic government, split the
    Ettehadieh in two factions: one believing in the armed movement and the
    other opposing it. Mr. Tolu i Semnani belonged to the latter group. In the
    winter of 1982, armed members of the Ettehadieh hid in a forest in the
    North of Iran (Jangal in Farsi) outside the city of Amol. This group, also
    known as the Jangal group, was involved in several clashes with the
    Revolutionary guards and ultimately, on January 26, attacked the city of
    Amol hoping to generate a general uprising. The attempt to seize Amol
    failed. It is reported that a number of the group s members, revolutionary
    guards, and civilians were killed during the Amol clash. Subsequently,
    members of the Ettehadieh, including those who opposed the Amol uprising,
    were arrested and tried for belonging to the organization and for having
    participated in the Amol clash Mr. Tolu i s wife, also an activist in the
    group, was forced to flee the country with her toddler daughter while
    pregnant. His son was born after his execution. Arrest and detention
    According to the interviewees, the defendant was arrested in July 1982,
    along with many other members of the Ettehadieh Komonist-ha at a meeting
    he had attended for the organization. The last time his family saw him
    before his arrest was at 9:00 am. The authorities did not inform the
    family of the place of his detention. It became known that he was held at
    the Evin Prison, when the authorities returned him to his parents house
    that night to search for incriminating documents against him. The
    revolutionary guards took family documents and antique pieces from the
    house that they never returned. The arrest of Mr. Tolu i Semnani, along
    with other members of the Ettehadieh, was announced on the radio in August
    1982. The broadcast did not specify the date of his arrest. While his
    family was not aware of whether he was tortured or not, they were informed
    that a member of his political group had died under torture. The defendant
    was allowed visitation for the first time in November 1982, four months
    after his arrest. His father was given permission to visit him twice.
    During one of those visit he warned his father, Leave the country. We are
    done for! The visits were never held privately and all the detainees were
    kept in one room, separated from their families by a screen. Trial Based
    on the available information, 28 or 30 individuals were tried together
    between January 9 and 15, 1983. The trial was held at an auditorium at the
    Evin Prison in Tehran. The family was not aware of the intention of the
    government to try the defendant until the morning of the trial. Mr. Tolu i
    Semnani was not given access to an attorney or the file containing the
    evidence against him, and he was not given the opportunity to procure
    witnesses. One of the interviewees recalls seeing his picture in the
    newspapers: he had lost a bit of hair and had very sad face. At the day of
    his trial, all around the courtroom, were banners
