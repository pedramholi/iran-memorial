    Dr. Bahram Afnan, former head of the internal medicine ward at Fars
    Regional Medical Center and a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of
    the Baha'is in Shiraz, is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999
    report published by the Baha i International Community. The report, Iran s
    Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community , documents
    the persecutions of the members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978. Additional information was
    drawn from the newspaper Khabar-e Jonub , published in Shiraz (22 February
    1983), and from various issues of the The Baha i World . See for example:
    Vol. XVIII, 1979-1983, Haifa 1986 or description of events as published in
    A Tribute to the Faithful by Mah Mihr Gulistanih, or Olya's Story by Olya
    Roohizadegan. Dr. Afnan was a descendant of Siyyid Muhammd Ali, known as
    the Bab, a person considered holy by the Baha'is. His prominent lineage
    contributed to his position as a leading member of the Baha'i community in
    Shiraz. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the
    Baha i threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national
    security in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and
    detention Dr. Afnan was arrested around 4:00 pm on the afternoon of 23
    October 1982 on the way to his clinic in Shiraz. On the same afternoon his
    home was searched by the authorities. According to reports by
    eyewitnesses, prison guards targeted him as a prominent figure to get to
    the other Baha'i prisoners. Because of his religious beliefs, the prison
    authorities considered him to be an unbeliever, and thus "unclean", and he
    was subjected to humiliating treatment similar to that of atheist
    political prisoners. Prison wardens refused to have any physical contact
    with the prisoner even when, for example, they were guiding the
    blindfolded prisoner to the interrogation room. In such case guards would
    give him the end of a folded newspaper and hold the other end, avoiding
    contact. Dr. Afnan was subjected to solitary confinement and much
    psychological and physical torture, including at least two ta'zir
    (whipping) sessions of 100 lashes each, which resulted in two heart
    attacks and his transfer to Mursalin General Hospital while in custody.
    After his recovery, he was transferred to Adelabad where he was imprisoned
    until his execution. Trial Iranian authorities gave no information to Dr.
    Afnan s family regarding his trial. However, according to reports by the
    the Baha i World , authorities informed the defendant that he would be
    subjected to four sessions in which he would be given the opportunity to
    recant his faith and accept Islam. He was informed that if he did not sign
    a prepared statement rejecting Baha ism, he would be killed. It is unclear
    if all these sessions took place and whether or not these sessions
    replaced a trial. Charges The text of the indictment was not provided to
    Dr. Afnan s family. However, the available information indicates that the
    charges against the defendant related to his religious beliefs. While in
    detention, the defendant was interrogated and pressured to recant his
    faith. The defendant s colleagues' petition for his release was reportedly
    rejected by the religious judge in charge of the case on the grounds of
    his being a Baha'i. Further, in an interview published in the Newspaper
    Khabar-e Jonub the religious judge, Head of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Shiraz, in charge of the case, warned the Baha is to embrace
    dear Islam and recant Baha ism
