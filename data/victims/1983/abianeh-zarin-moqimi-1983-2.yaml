    Ms. Zarin Moqimi (also spelled "Muqimi"), a graduate of English
    literature, poet and author, an employee, a teacher of Baha'i children's
    classes and an Assistant to the Auxiliary Board member and member of
    several Baha'i committees, is one of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a
    1999 report published by the Baha i International Community. The report,
    Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community ,
    documents the persecutions of the members of the Faith in the Islamic
    Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since 1978. Additional
    information was drawn from the newspaper Khabar-e Jonub , published in
    Shiraz (22 February 1983), and from various issues of the The Baha i World
    . See for example: Vol. XVIII, 1979-1983, Haifa 1986 or description of
    events as published in A Tribute to the Faithful by Mah Mihr Gulistanih,
    or Olya's Story by Olya Roohizadegan. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic
    of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected
    the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest
    religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the
    time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified
    and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention Ms. Moqimi was arrested
    along with her parents by revolutionary guards at their family home on 23
    October 1982. She was taken to the Sepah Detention Centre for initial
    processing and interrogation before her transfer to Adelabad Prison.
    Because of her religious beliefs, the prison authorities considered her to
    be an unbeliever, and thus "unclean", and she was subjected to humiliating
    treatment similar to that of atheist political prisoners. Prison wardens
    refused to have any physical contact with the prisoner even when, for
    example, they were guiding the blindfolded prisoner to the interrogation
    room. In such case guards would give her the end of a folded newspaper and
    hold the other end, avoiding contact. She remained in custody at Adelabad
    Prison until her execution. Trial Iranian authorities provided no
    information to Zarin s family regarding her trial. However, according to
    reports by the the Baha i World , authorities informed the defendant that
    she would be subjected to four sessions in which she would be given the
    opportunity to recant her faith and accept Islam. She was informed that if
    she did not sign a prepared statement rejecting Baha ism, she would be
    killed. It is unclear if all these sessions took place and whether or not
    these sessions replaced a trial. Charges The text of the indictment was
    not provided to Zarin s family. However, the available information
    indicates that the charges against the defendant related to her religious
    beliefs. While in detention, the defendant was interrogated and pressured
    to recant her faith. Further, in an interview published in the Newspaper
    Khabar-e Jonub the religious judge, Head of the Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal of Shiraz, in charge of the case, warned the Baha is to embrace
    dear Islam and recant Baha ism, which is rationally and logically doomed,
    before it is too late. The judge also discussed at length the charges and
    the alleged crimes committed by the defendants and argued that they were
    arrested because they were active members of the Baha i administration and
    because of their direct or indirect relationship with the House of Justice
    based in Israel, which follows the Israeli government. The judge s
    statements regarding those arrested also stressed that the religious
    activities of the defendants were criminal activities based on Article 13
    of the constitution, which deems illegal any activity for Baha is and
    considers a crime the organization of
