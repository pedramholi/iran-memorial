    The execution of Ms. Mina Madadi, along with seven others, was reported in
    the Jomhuri Eslami daily on August 11, 1983. Arrest and detention The
    circumstances of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known.
    Trial No information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Ms.
    Madadi was reportedly charged with being persistently involved in the
    supply and distribution of heroin, having a long history of selling heroin
    in the packages containing 5 gm and 10 centigrams, transporting 28 gm of
    heroin and confessing to supplying 15 packages, containing 50 gm of heroin
    each and having a long history of supplying and distributing of heroin
    several times. According to this report, she had worked in close
    collaboration with the well-known international traffickers- some of whom
    already executed- and established smuggling gangs. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Ms. Madadi's
    defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s
    Office sentenced Ms. Madadi to death. The sentence was carried out.
