    The information about Mr. Hamid Mo’asses Ghaffari is taken from the book
    The Martyrs of the Tudeh Party of Iran by The Tudeh Party Publications. He
    was born in Sanandaj in 1956. He studied chemistry at Razi University in
    Kermanshah. In 1979, he joined the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party of Iran
    was created in 1941. The Party ideology was Marxist-Leninist and it
    supported policies of the former Soviet Union. The Party played a major
    role in Iran’s political scene until it was banned for the second time
    following the August 19, 1953 coup. After the 1979 Revolution, the Party
    declared Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic regime
    revolutionaries and anti-imperialists and actively supported the new
    government. Although the Party never opposed the Islamic Republic, it
    became the target of government attacks in 1982 when most of the Party
    leaders and members were imprisoned. Arrest and detention The
