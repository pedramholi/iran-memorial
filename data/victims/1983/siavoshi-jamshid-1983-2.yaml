    Mr. Siavoshi was a trustworthy, pious, and charitable man. His life had
    been threatened and his property had been looted for promoting the Baha i
    religion, and he had therefore been forced to leave his place of residence
    on numerous occasions and rebuild his life elsewhere. News of the
    execution of Mr. Jamshid Siavoshi (also spelled " Siyavushi ") and 5 other
    Baha i men was published in Baha i News monthly, a publication belonging
    to the National Spiritual Assembly of Baha is of the United States (June
    18, 1983); Baha is Public Relations Office (June 20, 1983); and The Times
    newspaper (June 21, 1983). He was one of the 206 individuals whose name
    was published in the Worldwide Baha i Community s 1999 report. This
    report, entitled The Baha i Question: Iran s Secret Blueprint for the
    Destruction of a Religious Community , dealt with the persecution of
    members of the Baha i faith in Iran by the Islamic Republic, and contained
    a list of Baha is who were killed in Iran since 1979. Additional
    information was obtained from Khabar-e Jonoob newspaper (February 12, and
    February 22, 1983); The New York Times (May 22, 1983); Sahifeye Imam (The
    Imam s Book ), Volume 17 (May 28, 1983); Baha i World Almanac, Volume 18,
    1979-1983 (Haifa, 1986); an account of events as published in A Tribute to
    the Faithful by Mah Mehr Golestaneh (1992); the book Olya s Story written
    by Olya Ruhizadegan; Andalib Magazine (Winter 1988), the Archives of Baha
    i Persecution in Iran (undated); Yaftan-e Mazar ( Finding the resting
    places ) website; Morteza Esmailipur s YouTube Channel (January 26, and
    June 15, 2016); Martyrs of the Baha i Religion website (undated); Iran
    Press Watch website (June 17, 2017); Dar Gozar-e Tarikh ( Throughout
    History ) Telegram Channel (June18, 2019); and the Report of the United
    States Congressional Hearing published in the World Order Magazine (Winter
    1983-1984). Mr. Siavoshi was born in 1944-45 in Adassieh, Jordan. He spent
    his childhood in the city of Yazd and studied there. After finishing his
    mandatory military service, Mr. Siavoshi lived in Nurabad in Mamassani
    [Fars Province] for a time, and then moved to Tehran and took up residence
    in the outskirts of the town of Varamin. He was a member of the local
    Spiritual Assembly in that region. Mr. Siavoshi was married and loved his
    wife very much. He was a member of the local Spiritual Assembly and the
    Assembly s treasurer, and was a member of the Lajneh Malhufiun ( displaced
    persons committee ) (1) in the city of Shiraz. ( Archives of Baha i
    Persecution in Iran, undated; Andalib Magazine; Morteza Esmailipur s
    YouTube Channel, June 15, 2016). In 1976-77, Mr. Siavoshi and his wife,
    Ms. Tahereh Arjomandi Siavoshi , settled in the city of Yassuj in order to
    establish a Baha i assembly there. He ran a retail store there. Mr.
    Siavoshi and his wife were forced to leave Yassuj in December 1978, and
    take up residence in Shiraz, after a group of individuals, instigated by a
    cleric, attacked and pillaged their home and property. They spent a while
    in poverty. He opened a retail clothing store in Shiraz and his business
    started doing well approximately in the Summer of 1982. He and his wife
    supported Baha is whose property had been expropriated. ( Archives of Baha
    i Persecution in Iran, undated; Andalib Magazine; Iran Wire). In March
    1979, Mr. Siavoshi was detained for one night at the Yassuj Revolutionary
    Committee. (Yaftan-e Mazar website). Mr. Siavoshi s case is related to the
    death sentence issued for 22 Baha is and the execution of 6 Baha i men and
    10 Baha i women in June 1983 in Shiraz. Extensive international efforts
    were made in order to save the imprisoned Baha is. About a month prior to
    the implementation of the death sentences, then-U.S. President Ronald
    Reagan asked the Islamic Republic of Iran s authorities to stop the
    executions. A week after the American President s message, Ayatollah
    Khomeini, then-Leader of the Islamic Republic, addressing the U.S.
    government at a gathering of Iranian officials and stated: We wouldn t
    have heard a peep out of you if these people were not spies. [You re
    speaking up now] because these are a bunch of people who are on your side
    and [protect] your interests And now [you] are making all this noise for
    22 Baha is, who, they claim, have gotten entangled and been entrapped in
    Iran, and now all of a sudden [you] are humanitarians and are crying foul
    and pleading with the whole world to come to these people s rescue. [But]
    people know you [better] (The New York Times, May 22, 1983; Sahifeye Imam,
    Volume 17, May 28, 1983). The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran:
    Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the
    members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious
    minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic
