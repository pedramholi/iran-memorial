    The execution of Mr. Esmaeel Satari Najari, along with nineteen others,
    was announced in a communiqu from the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. This communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami Daily on December 8, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to
    the official communiqu , Mr. Satari Najari was charged with being
    consistently and actively involved in the purchase and distribution of
    heroin, possessing 108.50 centigram of heroin when arrested, confessing to
    buying packages of 100 gm of heroin and selling them in packages of 5 gm,
    and having a previous record of robbery as well as purchasing and
    distributing heroin. The validity of the criminal charges brought against
    this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Satari
    Najari s defense. Judgment One of the tribunals of the Anti-Narcotics
    Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran sentenced Mr. Satari
    Najari to death. The sentence was carried out at dawn.
