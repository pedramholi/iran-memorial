    Information about Mr. Mansur Eskandari-Torbeqan, son of Hossein, was sent
    to the Boroumand Foundation by a person familiar with his case, via an

    Guerilla Organization in 2007. The Fadaiyan Khalq Organization, a
    Marxist-Leninist group inspired by the Cuban Revolution and the urban
    guerilla movements of Latin America, was founded in 1971 by two communist

    organization, which had renounced armed struggle, split over their support
    of the Islamic Republic and of the Soviet Union. The Fadaiyan Khalq
    Minority opposed the Islamic Republic and was active mainly in the
    political arena and the labor movement. Arrest and Detention Mr.

    Prison. In an interview with the Payam Fadai publication, one of his

    regard, I have to talk about the zealous comrade, Mansur Eskandari (Dr.
    Mehran) whom I had seen at the Section 209 [of the Evin prison]. The
    torturer had beaten him with a shovel handle in a way to break it in half.
    Worse, he had shoved and twisted the broken tip in his back. This act and
    the remains of wood chips in his body caused infection and a disgusting
    wound and each day they had to pick wood chips from his bloody infectious
    wound. Mr. Khalili continued, Mansur Eskandari (Dr. Mehran) was a prisoner
    identified by Lajvardi himself and according to many prisoners, Lajvardi
    [The Head of Evin prison and the Public Prosecutor of Tehran] participated
    in his torture and interrogation. Trial No information is available on Mr.
