    She took care of her home and served on the Baha i Marriage Counseling
    Committee. No one was spared during her arrest, neither her daughters nor
    her two houseguests. Ms. Ezat Eshraqi (also spelled "Izzat Ishraqi"), a
    homemaker and a member of the Baha'i Marriage Counseling Committee, is one
    of the 206 Iranian Baha is listed in a 1999 report published by the Baha i
    International Community. The report, Iran s Secret Blueprint for the
    Destruction of a Religious Community , documents the persecutions of the
    members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is
    killed since 1978. Additional information was drawn from the newspaper
    Khabar-e Jonub , published in Shiraz (22 February 1983), and from various
    issues of the The Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XVIII, 1979-1983,
    Haifa 1986 or description of events as published in A Tribute to the
    Faithful by Mah Mihr Gulistanih, or Olya's Story by Olya Roohizadegan and
    A Congressional Hearing in World Order Magazine, Winter 1983-1984 edition,
    and a letter written by her husband, Mr. Inayatu'llah Eshraqi, to his
    family outside of Iran on 29/11/1981. Ms. Eshraqi had been previously
    detained and interrogated in 1981. (Olya's Story p. 173 World Order p.
    36). On Tuesday, 24 November 1981, her home was searched by revolutionary
    guards and Baha'i books and papers were all confiscated. The next day, the
    Revolutionary Guards arrested Ms. Eshraqi along with her husband, two
    daughters, and two houseguests. They were detained for two days at the
    Sepah [Revolutionary Guards headquarters], where they were interrogated
    before being released on November 27. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic
    of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected
    the members of the Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest
    religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to
    systematic harassment and persecution, depriving them of their most
    fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the
    Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it
    as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights
    associated with the status of a religious minority; they cannot profess
    and practice their faith, and are banned from public functions.
    Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them to abuse
    and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific to the
    time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was amplified
    and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters of
    Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention Ms. Eshraqi was arrested
    for the second time along with her husband and daughter around 8:30 pm on
    29 November 1982 at her home in Shiraz. She was taken to the Sepah
    Detention Centre for processing. According to reports by survivors and
    fellow cellmates, it was there that, on 2 December 1982, she was subjected
    to a mock execution. On 31 December 1982 she was transferred to Adelabad
    prison, where she remained in custody until her execution. Ms. Eshraqi was
    allowed to see her husband who was also in custody, once before her
    execution. (World Order p. 37) Because of her religious beliefs, the
    prison authorities considered her to be an unbeliever, and thus "unclean",
    and she was subjected to humiliating treatment similar to that of atheist
    political prisoners. Prison wardens refused to have any physical contact
    with the prisoner even when, for example, they were guiding the
    blindfolded prisoner to the interrogation room. In such case guards would
    give her the end of a folded newspaper and hold the other end, avoiding
    contact. Family visitors and former cellmates have reported that she had
    had been repeatedly interrogated by or under the supervision of the
    religious magistrate. Based on the available information, one of these
    interrogation sessions took place on 7 December 1982. Trial There is no
    detail available about Ms. Eshraqi's trial. However, according to reports
    by the the Baha i World , authorities informed the defendant that she
    would be subjected to four sessions in which she would be given the
    opportunity to recant her faith and accept Islam. She was informed that if
    she did not sign a prepared statement rejecting the Baha i religion, she
    would be killed. It is unclear if a
