    Mojahedin Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. “Rah-e Kargar” or the “Revolutionary
    Workers Organization of Iran” was established in the summer of 1979. The

    identified themselves as Marxist-Leninists, promoting a socialist
    revolution and the leadership of the proletariat. They differed with the

    Republic and Ayatollah Khomeini’s leadership. Arrest and detention The
