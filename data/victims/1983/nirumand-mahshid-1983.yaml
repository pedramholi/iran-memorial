    Ms. Mahshid Nirumand, a physicist, a teacher of Baha'i children's classes
    and a member of Youth Committee as well as the Local Spiritual Assembly's
    liaison for the Nineteen Day Feasts in Shiraz, is one of the 206 Iranian
    Baha is listed in a 1999 report published by the Baha i International
    Community. The report, Iran s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a
    Religious Community , documents the persecutions of the members of the
    Faith in the Islamic Republic of Iran and lists the Baha is killed since
    1978. Additional information was drawn from the newspaper Khabar-e Jonub ,
    published in Shiraz (22 February 1983), and from various issues of the The
    Baha i World . See for example: Vol. XVIII, 1979-1983, Haifa 1986 or
    description of events as published in A Tribute to the Faithful by Mah
    Mihr Gulistanih, or Olya's Story by Olya Roohizadegan. The Baha is in the
    Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The authorities of the Islamic
    Republic have subjected the members of the Baha'i religious community of
    Iran - the largest religious minority, with approximately 300 thousand
    members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment and persecution, depriving
    them of their most fundamental human rights. The Baha'i religion is not
    recognized under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, and Iranian
    authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a result, the Baha'is have been
    denied the rights associated with the status of a religious minority; they
    cannot profess and practice their faith, and are banned from public
    functions. Discrimination under the law and in practice has subjected them
    to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha is in Iran is not specific
    to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was in this era that it was
    amplified and institutionalized. During the Revolution itself, supporters
    of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes and businesses and in certain
    instances, even committed murder. On the eve of his return from France to
    Iran, in response to a question regarding political and religious freedom
    of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic government, Ayatollah Khomeini
    stated: They are a political party; they are harmful and detrimental. They
    will not be acceptable. The interviewer asked another question: Will they
    be free to perform their religious rites? The Ayatollah responded: No.
    Khomeini had previously spoken of the Baha i threat to the Shah s regime,
    Islam, national unity, and national security in various speeches. (Asoo
    website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and detention Ms. Nirumand was arrested
    on the evening of 29 November 1982 at her family home. She was taken to
    the Sepah [Revolutionary Guards] Detention Centre, where she was detained
    during December and interrogated and subjected to torture. On 2 December
    1982, she was subjected to a mock execution, a technique used to terrorize
    detainees and force them to confess. She was finally transferred to
    Adelabad Prison on 31 December 1982. She remained there until 16 January
    1983 when she was taken to the Revolutionary Court for prosecution.
    According to reports by former cellmates she was tortured psychologically
    by a prison guard who made her watch others who were being tortured. In
    addition, she was threatened with lashes, and yelled at or begged to
    recant her faith. Because of her religious beliefs, the prison authorities
    considered her to be an unbeliever, and thus "unclean and she was
    subjected to humiliating treatment similar to that of atheist political
    prisoners. Prison wardens refused to have any physical contact with the
    prisoner even when, for example, they were guiding the blindfolded
    prisoner to the interrogation room. In such case guards would give her the
    end of a folded newspaper and hold the other end, avoiding contact. She
    remained in custody at Adelabad Prison until her execution. Trial Iranian
    authorities gave no information to the defendant s family regarding her
    trial. According to reports by the the Baha i World , authorities informed
    the defendant that she would be subjected to four sessions in which she
    would be given the opportunity to recant her faith and accept Islam. She
    was informed that if she did not sign a prepared statement rejecting Baha
    ism, she would be killed. It was reported to the family that on the 20th
    of January, she faced the Religious Magistrate. Weather or not all four
    sessions took place or these sessions replaced a trial is not known.
    Charges The text of the indictment was not provided to Mahshid s family.
    However, the available information indicates that the charges against the
    defendant related to her religious beliefs. While in detention, the
    defendant was interrogated and pressured to recant her faith. Further, in
    an interview published in the Newspaper Khabar-e Jonub the religious
    judge, Head of the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunal of Shiraz, in charge of
    the case, warned the Baha is to embrace dear Islam and recant Baha ism,
    which is rationally and logically doomed, before it is too late . The
    judge also discu
