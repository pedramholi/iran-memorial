    The execution of Mr. Hassan Akhtarmohammad, along with nineteen others,
    was announced in a communiqu from the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. This communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami Daily on December 8, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances
    of this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No
    information is available on the defendant s trial. Charges According to
    the official communiqu , Mr. Akhtarmohammad was charged with being
    consistently and actively involved in the purchase and distribution of
    heroin, establishing an international professional drug-trafficking gang,
    possessing 2.637 kg of heroin when arrested, confessing to dealing heroin
    twice before, and having a previous record of repeated drug dealing. The
    validity of the criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be
    ascertained in the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial.
    International human rights organizations have drawn attention to reports
    indicating that the Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up
    charges against their political opponents and executed them for drug
    trafficking, sexual, and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged
    drug traffickers have been sentenced to death following judicial processes
    that fail to meet international standards. The exact number of people
    convicted based on trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The
    report of this execution does not contain information regarding the
    evidence provided against the defendant. Defense No information is
    available on Mr. Akhtarmohammad s defense. Judgment One of the tribunals
    of the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public Prosecutor s Office in Tehran
    sentenced Mr. Akhtarmohammad to death. The sentence was carried out at
    dawn.
