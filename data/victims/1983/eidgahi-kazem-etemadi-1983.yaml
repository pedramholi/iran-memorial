    Mr. Kazem E temadi Eidgahi is one of the 430 Martyrs of the Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class published on the
    website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the names of those
    members of the organization who died after the revolution of 1979. More
    than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed. Mr.
    Kayqobadi, who was Mr. E temadi Eidgahi s cellmate at Evin prison in
    December 1982, mentions him in a book chapter in the edited volume The
    Inescapable Escape (Noghteh Books: Koln, 2008). According to his former
    cellmate, Mr. E temadi Eidgahi introduced himself to other prisoners as a
    candidate for membership of the Peykar Organization, and mentioned that
    his nickname in the Organization was Hossein Amuzgar. The author remembers
    him as bashful, dignified, and compassionate, qualities that soon led to
    him being in charge of the cell. According to the report of the Peykar
    Organization, Mr. E temadi Eidgahi was an editorial board member of the
    Peykar publication. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the
    Working Class was founded by a number of dissident members of the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar
    was also joined by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se
    (Third line). The founding tenets of Peykar included the rejection of
    guerrilla struggle and a strong stand against the pro-Soviet policies of
    the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar viewed the Soviet Union as a Social
    imperialist state, believed that China had deviated from the
    Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically opposed all factions of the
    Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression of dissidents by the Iranian
    government and splits within Peykar in 1981 and 1982 effectively
    dismantled the Organization and scattered its supporters. By the
    mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest and detention
    According to his cellmate, Mr. E temadi Eidgahi was arrested while waiting
    for a taxi in a street without being informed of the reason for his
    arrest. He was taken to the Joint Committee (formerly known as the Joint
    Anti-Sabotage Committee, later renamed Tohid prison, which is Ebrat Museum
    since the early 1990s). At the Committee, he was beaten and tortured. The
    interrogators asked for his home address and when they were taking him to
    his home, Mr. E temadi Eidgahi took advantage of a moment and attempted to
    escape. He was shot in the leg and taken to a hospital and then to Evin
    prison. There, a former comrade identified him as a political activist.
    Subsequently, Mr. E temadi Eidgahi was returned to the Joint Committee for
    interrogation. He was later imprisoned at Evin prison. Trial According to
    his former cellmate, Mr. E temadi Eidgahi was tried. But no detail is
    known about the trial. Charges His cellmate remembers that Mr E temadi
    Eidgahi mentioned his charge as cooperation with the Peykar Organization.
    Evidence of guilt The report of this execution does not contain
    information regarding the evidence provided against the defendant. Defense
    According to the information available, Mr. E temadi Eidgahi defended
    socialism in court. Judgment Mr. Kazem E temadi Eidgahi was executed by
    firing squad in Tehran on April 30, 1983, along with three other men (his
    cellmate). The list of the Peykar Organization reported the execution date
    as May 4, 1983. Mr. Mohammad Ebrahim Ashkan (Ashqani) is one of the 430
    Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This list contains the
    names of those members of the organization who died after the revolution
    of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this list have been executed.
    Mr. Ashkan is also among the 12,028 individuals listed in an addendum to
    the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes individuals,
    affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed or killed
    during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to
    the publication date of the magazine. According to the report of the
    Peykar Organization, Mr. Ashkan was an engineer and a political activist
    in Tabriz. The Peykar Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class
    was founded by a number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq
    Organization who had converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined
    by a number of political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line).
