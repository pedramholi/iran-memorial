    Mr. Valiollah Rudgarian is one of the 430 individuals whose names appear
    on the list of “Martyrs of the Peykar Organization for the Liberation of
    the Working Class” published on the website of Andeesheh va Peykar. This
    list contains the names of those members of the organization who died
    after the revolution of 1979. More than 400 of the individuals on this
    list have been executed. He is also one of the 12,028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by the
    Mojahedin Khalq Organization on September 6, 1985. The list includes
    individuals, affiliated with various opposition groups, who were executed
    or killed during clashes with the Islamic Republic security forces from
    June 1981 to the publication date of the magazine. Moreover, Mr. Nima
    Parvaresh writes about Mr. Rudgarian in his book An Unequal Battle: a
    report of seven years in prison, 1982 to 1989 . Mr. Rudgarian was a
    respected teacher in the northern city of Amol (Mazandaran province).
    Twice, he successfully escaped arrest by the Revolutionary Guards. His
    wife, Ms. Minu Sotudeh Peyma, was executed in 1982. The Peykar
    Organization for the Liberation of the Working Class was founded by a
    number of dissident members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization who had
    converted to Marxism-Leninism. Peykar was also joined by a number of
    political organizations, known as Khat-e Se (Third line). The founding
    tenets of Peykar included the rejection of guerrilla struggle and a strong
    stand against the pro-Soviet policies of the Iranian Tudeh Party. Peykar
    viewed the Soviet Union as a “social imperialist” state, believed that
    China had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist principles, and radically
    opposed all factions of the Islamic regime of Iran. The brutal repression
    of dissidents by the Iranian government and splits within Peykar in 1981
    and 1982 effectively dismantled the Organization and scattered its
    supporters. By the mid-1980s, Peykar was no longer in existence. Arrest
    and detention Mr. Rudgarian was arrested at a team house in Rasht (Gilan
    Province) in the summer of 1982. His true identity was not known to the
    state official; he had claimed to be a truck driver. The officials wanted
    to release him and he was to be released. However, a Peykar sympathizer
    whp had been arrested and collaborated with prison authorities, disclosed
    Mr. Rudgarian’s true identity. He was interrogated for a second round. The
    marks of torture were evident on his feet and face. Trial Mr. Rudgarian
    was tried twice, once when he was arrested and the second time, a week
    after he was identified by his former comrade. Charges No information is
    available on Mr. Rudgarian’s charges. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense Mr. Rudgarian defended Marxism in the
    court. In response to the religious judge’s question regarding Marx,
    Engels, and Lenin, he replied, “they are the bee’s knees of human
    society.” This resulted in returning him to Section 209 for torture.
    Judgment According to Mr. Parvaresh, Mr. Rudgarian was taken from his cell
    to be executed while chanting “The Internationale” on May 1, 1983. He was
    29 years old.
