    The execution of Mr. Faraj Chehri, along with seven others, was reported
    in the Jomhuri Eslami daily on September 25, 1983. The validity of the
    criminal charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in
    the absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic’s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Furthermore,Mr. Faraj Chehr (a supporter of
    the Mojahedin Khalq Organization) is one of the 12028 individuals listed
    in an addendum to the Mojahed magazine (No 261), published by Mojahedin
    Khalq Organization in 1985. The list includes individuals, affiliated with
    various opposition groups, who were executed or killed during clashes with
    the Islamic Republic security forces from June 1981 to the publication
    date of the magazine. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant’s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
