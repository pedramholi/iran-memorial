    A Shiraz Baha i, he earned his living as a hospital accountant and an
    assistant university professor. Can it be that charges against him
    included Not being married ? Mr. Bahram Yalda'i is one of the 206 Iranian
    Baha'is listed in a 1999 report published by the Baha'i International
    Community. Mr. Yalda i was an assistant professor at Shiraz University and
    an accountant at the Zaynabiyyih Hospital. He was a member of the
    Education committee and the liaison between the Local Spiritual Assembly
    of the Baha'is in Shiraz and the local Baha'i families. The report, Iran s
    Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community , documents
    the persecutions of the members of the Faith in the Islamic Republic of
    Iran and lists the Baha'is killed since 1978. Additional information was
    drawn from the newspaper Khabar-e Jonub , published in Shiraz (22 February
    1983), and from various issues of the The Baha i World . See for example:
    Vol. XVIII, 1979-1983, Haifa 1986 or description of events as published in
    A Tribute to the Faithful by Mah Mihr Gulistanih, or Olya's Story by Olya
    Roohizadegan. The Baha is in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Background The
    authorities of the Islamic Republic have subjected the members of the
    Baha'i religious community of Iran - the largest religious minority, with
    approximately 300 thousand members in 1979(1)- to systematic harassment
    and persecution, depriving them of their most fundamental human rights.
    The Baha'i religion is not recognized under the Constitution of the
    Islamic Republic, and Iranian authorities refer to it as a heresy. As a
    result, the Baha'is have been denied the rights associated with the status
    of a religious minority; they cannot profess and practice their faith, and
    are banned from public functions. Discrimination under the law and in
    practice has subjected them to abuse and violence.(2) Persecution of Baha
    is in Iran is not specific to the time of the Islamic Republic but it was
    in this era that it was amplified and institutionalized. During the
    Revolution itself, supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini attacked Baha i homes
    and businesses and in certain instances, even committed murder. On the eve
    of his return from France to Iran, in response to a question regarding
    political and religious freedom of Baha is under the rule of an Islamic
    government, Ayatollah Khomeini stated: They are a political party; they
    are harmful and detrimental. They will not be acceptable. The interviewer
    asked another question: Will they be free to perform their religious
    rites? The Ayatollah responded: No. Khomeini had previously spoken of the
    Baha i threat to the Shah s regime, Islam, national unity, and national
    security in various speeches. (Asoo website, October 6, 2015). Arrest and
    detention Mr. Yalda'i, his parents and a guest were arrested in the
    evening of 23 October 1982 in their home in Shiraz, minutes after a Baha'i
    meeting had ended there. A few armed revolutionary guards entered and
    searched his house, confiscating Baha'i books and papers. After processing
    at the Sepah [revolutionary guards headquarters], he was placed in a
    solitary cell with two other youths. Because of his religious beliefs, the
    prison authorities considered him to be an unbeliever, and thus "unclean",
    and he was subjected to humiliating treatment similar to that of atheist
    political prisoners. Prison wardens refused to have any physical contact
    with the prisoner even when, for example, they were guiding the
    blindfolded prisoner to the interrogation room. In such case guards would
    give him the end of a folded newspaper and hold the other end, avoiding
    contact. He suffered from lack of space, food, access to sanitary
    facilities and flogging for seventy days. Once during his detention he was
    brought before his mother, Nusrat Yalda i, while the guards threatened to
    torture him in front of her. Subsequently, he was transferred to Adelabad
    Prison, where he remained in custody until his execution. Trial The
    authorities provided no details about Mr. Yalda'i's trial to his family.
    However, visitors and former cellmates report that he had been repeatedly
    interrogated by or under the supervision of the Religious Judge and
    President of the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Shiraz. According to
    reports by the the Baha i World , authorities informed the defendant that
    he would be subjected to four sessions in which he would be given the
    opportunity to recant his faith and accept Islam. He was informed that if
    he did not sign a prepared statement rejecting Baha ism, he would be
    killed. It is unclear if all these sessions took place and whether or not
    these sessions replaced a trial. Charges The text of the indictment was
    not provided to the family. However, according to statements by the
    Religious Judge and President of the Revolutionary Court, Mr. Yalda'i's
    charges were related to his religious beliefs and activities. During his
    detention, the defendant was asked to recant his faith. It is also
    reported that he was charged wi
