    The execution of Mr. Ahmad Homaee, along with eleven others, was announced
    in a communiqu by the Tribunal of the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri Eslami
    daily on February 15, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances of this
    defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information is
    available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Homaee was reported to be
    charged with being actively involved in the production and distribution of
    heroin in Hamedan and Tehran, sale of 107 gm of heroin once, possession of
    195 gm of heroin concealed in his garden and possession of 67 gm of heroin
    when arrested in Hamedan. The validity of the criminal charges brought
    against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the absence of the basic
    guarantees of a fair trial. International human rights organizations have
    drawn attention to reports indicating that the Islamic Republic s
    authorities have brought trumped up charges against their political
    opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual, and other
    criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have been
    sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr. Homaee's
    defense. Judgment The Tribunal of the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office declared Mr. Homaee a corruptor on earth and sentenced
    him to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the sentence was
    carried out.
