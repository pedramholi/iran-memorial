    The execution of Mr. Seif Ali Abdollahzadeh, along with sixteen others,
    was announced in a communiqu from the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Public
    Prosecutor s Office in Tehran. The communiqu was reported in the Jomhuri
    Eslami Daily on October 8, 1983. Arrest and detention The circumstances of
    this defendant s arrest and detention are not known. Trial No information
    is available on the defendant s trial. Charges Mr. Abdollahzadeh was
    reportedly charged with purchasing and distributing narcotics, confessing
    to dealing more than 3.390 kg of heroin in a 4-month period and having
    been convicted previously several times. The validity of the criminal
    charges brought against this defendant cannot be ascertained in the
    absence of the basic guarantees of a fair trial. International human
    rights organizations have drawn attention to reports indicating that the
    Islamic Republic s authorities have brought trumped up charges against
    their political opponents and executed them for drug trafficking, sexual,
    and other criminal offences. Thousands of alleged drug traffickers have
    been sentenced to death following judicial processes that fail to meet
    international standards. The exact number of people convicted based on
    trumped-up charges is unknown. Evidence of guilt The report of this
    execution does not contain information regarding the evidence provided
    against the defendant. Defense No information is available on Mr.
    Abdollahzadeh's defense. Judgment The Anti-Narcotics Islamic Revolutionary
    Tribunal in Tehran declared Mr. Abdollahzadeh a corruptor on earth and
    sentenced him to death. Having been confirmed by the Supreme Court, the
    sentence was carried out at 5 a.m.
